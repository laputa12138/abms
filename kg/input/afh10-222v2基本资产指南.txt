Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1. General Information. Long before World War II, leaders in the Army Air 
Forces recognized the importance of being able to rapidly construct and sustain 
airfields close to or even behind enemy lines. Over the years, that fundamental 
understanding of projecting air power precipitated doctrine, organization, 
training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities 
(DOTMLPF) that continues to evolve today. The Air Force’s power projection 
mission requires that it be able to apply air, space, and cyberspace power 
anywhere in the world in support of U.S. national interests. In fact, air, space, 
and cyberspace power can reach across the full spectrum of military 
operations—from humanitarian assistance missions and stability operations, to 
the decisive application of air power in support of combat operations around the 
globe. To that end, the ability to develop a bare base or operating location 
quickly is an essential part of the USAF power projection mission, and 
subsequently one of civil engineers’ (CE) most important expeditionary and 
contingency tasks. 
1.2. Overview. Like most major construction projects, developing a bare base or 
operating location to beddown forces require both skilled personnel and suitable 
materiel to build facilities and infrastructure. Basic Expeditionary Airfield 
Resources (BEAR) and other assets help fulfill the latter requirement. BEAR is 
essentially war readiness materiel that is configured and stored ready to deploy. 
This handbook primarily addresses BEAR assets used during bare base 
development and force beddown activities. It contains CE tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs) that follow the precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine 
Document (AFDD) 4-0, Combat Support, and AFDD 3-34, Engineer 
Operations, and aids in the implementation of Air Force Policy Directive 
(AFPD) 10-2, Readiness. This relationship is illustrated in the Air Force CE 
hierarchy of publications (Figure 1.1.). Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force 
(Prime BEEF) team leaders, supervisors, and work crews may find this 
handbook useful during bare base development or beddown operations using 
BEAR and non-BEAR deployment assets.

1.3. Roles and Responsibilities. Several organizations have important roles and 
responsibilities for the development, management, and maintenance of BEAR. 
Some of them are listed in Table 1.1. See AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel 
(WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures, for a more complete list of BEAR 
roles and responsibilities.

or are in excess of determined requirement. 
1.4. BEAR Accountability. Accurate accountability is key to successful 
deployment, reception and sustainment of BEAR assets. Proper supply 
discipline must be maintained for the duration of deployments. Below are some 
common factors for tracking and maintaining BEAR assets. See AFI 25-101, 
and command guidance for specific accountability requirements. 
1.4.1. Upon equipment transfer, the contingency site civil engineer squadron has 
overall accountability and responsibility for maintaining BEAR assets. 
According to AFI 25-101, engineer squadron commanders should sign 
appropriate documentation and assume responsibility of BEAR equipment 
assets. When deployed to support theater activities, 49th Materiel Maintenance 
Group (MMG) personnel and other AF logistics personnel deployed in direct 
support of BEAR assets assist CE commanders in tracking assets and assigning 
responsibility to major users (Figure 1.2.). 
1.4.2. In addition, BEAR Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSP) will be 
transferred, before each deployment, to the 440th Supply Chain Operations 
Squadron (440 SCOS), in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part 2, 
Chap 26. Transferred MRSPs will be under the control of the contingency site 
Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) until returned to home station. Logistics 
personnel also account for all BEAR ISO containers using the Army Container 
Asset Management System (ACAMS), according to AFI 24-203, Preparation 
and Movement of Air Force Cargo.  
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012    
16 
 
 
Figure 1.2. Logistics Personnel Help Keep Track of BEAR Assets.  
 
1.4.3. When BEAR assets are transferred to other services/agencies, they will be 
handled IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part 2, Chapter 22. 
1.4.4. All fuel and water bladders should be transferred to the contingency CE 
squadron commander at the time of deployment. These items are not normally 
reconstituted after deployment. 
1.4.5. A variety of options exist to redeploy BEAR assets, including a BEAR 
Reconstitution Team (UTC XFAJ1), contractor personnel, or CE personnel. The 
goal is an orderly breakdown of BEAR assets so they can be redeployed and 
reconstituted as quickly as possible—important processes to ensure BEAR 
future contingency operations readiness.  
1.4.6. During redeployment preparations, the contingency site BCE and XFAJ1 
supply personnel conduct a joint inventory and review accountable 
documentation. The contingency site BCE must be relieved of accountability 
before redeploying.  
1.4.7. Following contingency use, reconstitution is generally conducted for all 
BEAR equipment, vehicles, and MRSPs by the storing MAJCOM.

1.5. Equipment Packaging and Configurations. In recent history, bare base 
beddown and sustainment equipment has undergone significant changes to the 
way it is packaged and configured for deployment. Equipment sets formerly 
known as Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon transitioned to BEAR equipment 
and housekeeping sets. Today, these BEAR sets are being converted to 
capabilities-based UTC packages under the BEAR Order of Battle (BOB) 
concept (Figure 1.3.). The goal is to further refine the priority and sequencing of 
delivered assets and make improvements in equipment configurations that create 
efficiencies and enhance flexibility and responsiveness. Although, the major 
difference between these new air- and surface-configured BOB UTCs (Table 
1.2.) is packaging, equipment contents do vary between some of them. Users 
should refer to appropriate UTC Management or Manpower and Equipment 
Force Packaging (MEFPAK) databases or see their Unit Deployment Manager 
(UDM) for current information.

SHELTERS 
2.1. General Information. The purpose of most shelters is to provide protection 
from the elements. As a rule, BEAR shelters are employed during times of war, 
natural disaster, or other emergency or contingency when no other form of 
acceptable protection is available (Figure 2.1.). They provide basic protection 
for troops deployed to austere locations or areas with limited or no facility 
support. This chapter highlights current BEAR shelters, non-BEAR shelters, and 
legacy shelters used during bare base development and force beddown 
operations. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 6, Guide to Bare Base Facility 
Erection, and applicable technical data for detailed guidance on erection, 
maintenance, and disassembly. 
Figure 2.1. Erecting Shelters at Forward Operating Location. 
 
2.2. BEAR Shelters. 
2.2.1. Small Shelter System (SSS). The small shelter system (Figure 2.2.) is an 
all-purpose tent-type shelter used for billeting, work areas, latrines and showers, 
storage, etc. When fully erected, this shelter measures 32.5 feet long by 20 feet 
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012    
22 
 
 
wide by 10 feet high (650 sq ft). The SSS is equipped to accept 120/208 volts 
alternating current (VAC), 60-cycle, single-phase power. The SSS is designated 
as the replacement for the TEMPER tent through attrition. Compared to the 
TEMPER tent, it is slightly lighter, tighter, and more vector proof. It also 
requires less day-to-day maintenance when erected, and its fabric is easier to 
repair. Six people can safely assemble the SSS in about 1.5 hours (nine labor 
hours). If required, multiple buildings can be interconnected. Environmental 
limitations of the SSS are listed in Table 2.1. See T.O. 35E5-6-11, Alaska Small 
Shelter System (AKSSS), and AFH 10-222, Volume 6, for siting and erection 
procedures.

2.2.2. Medium Shelter System (MSS). The medium shelter system (Figure 
2.3.) is an all-purpose, mid-sized shelter suitable for any environment or bare 
base mission with only normal organic support provided. The MSS is 52 feet 
long by 29.5 feet wide by 15 feet high (1,534 sq ft) and often used in 
maintenance, warehouse, storage and kitchen areas. The shelter is shipped and 
stored in its own containers and may be erected over soil, asphalt, or concrete. 
This shelter has a 120/208 VAC, 60-cycle, 3-phase, 5-wire electrical input 
connection. The MSS is replacing the General Purpose Shelter in the inventory. 
It provides tighter protection against dust and insects; has lower maintenance 
costs and takes up less shipping space. A minimum of six people can safely 
assemble this structure in about 4 hours (24 labor hours) and multiple shelters 
can be interconnected. Environmental limitations of the MSS are listed in Table 
2.2. Consult T.O. 35E5-6-21, California Medium Shelter System, and AFH 10-

2.2.3. Bare Base Dome Shelter. The dome shelter (Figure 2.4.) is a large, all-
purpose shelter used as a maintenance area, warehouse, or aircraft hangar. It is 
available in three sizes; 4K and 8K square feet, and can be extended in length 
indefinitely by adding additional modules. Each length module adds 
approximately 13-1/2 feet. Shelters receive a 120/208 VAC, 60-cycle, 3-phase, 
5-wire electrical input. Although RED HORSE and 49th MMG teams may have 
the lead when erecting dome shelters, Prime BEEF can expect to assist. The 
shelter can be erected and disassembled from ground level and all tools 
necessary for erection and disassembly are included in the shelter package. It 
can also be installed on concrete and secured with thunder studs. At least eight 
people are required to assemble the structure safely. Assembly time is 
approximately 256 man-hours. Environmental limitations of the dome shelter 
are listed in Table 2.3. Consult T.O. 35E4-216-1, Bare Base Dome Shelter, for 
more details.

2.3.1. Frame-Supported Tensioned Fabric Shelter (FSTFS). The frame-
supported tensioned fabric shelter (Figure 2.6.) is a large, all-purpose shelter 
used as a maintenance area or warehouse. It is available in two configurations; 
type A and type B shelters. The type A shelter has a minimum usable interior 
floor space of 60 feet by 140 feet (8400 square feet). The type B shelter has a 
minimum usable floor space of 60 feet by 70 feet (4200 square feet). Both 
shelters are portable and rapidly deployable, and require no concrete foundation. 
A minimum of eight people can assemble the structure safely. Assembly time is 
approximately 384 man-hours for type A shelters and 256 man-hours for type B. 
If necessary, multiple buildings can be interconnected. FSTFSs are gradually 
being replaced by the Dome Shelters, which provide more utility and versatility. 
Environmental limitations of the FSTFS are listed in Table 2.5. See T.O. 35E4-

Chapter 3 
WATER AND SANITATION 
3.1. General Information. Water distribution systems and sanitation facilities 
are essential for the health and morale of personnel at expeditionary bases. 
Water systems collect and purify raw water; stores and distributes potable water; 
and collects and distributes wastewater for disposal. Sanitation facilities include 
latrines, showers/shave apparatus, and laundries. This chapter provides a brief 
description of current BEAR water system components and sanitation facilities 
used during bare base development and force beddown operations. Legacy 
equipment still in use will also be addressed.  
3.2. BEAR Water System. The BEAR water system consists of five distinct 
subsystems; source run, water production, initial, follow-on, and industrial 
operation and flightline extension subsystems. The system is modular in 
design and scalable to meet a variety of user deployment needs. System 
components include reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPU), water 
storage tanks, pumps, hoses, fluid control devices and connectors, lift stations, 
and various other equipment items and components. Some of these items will be 
discussed here. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 11, Contingency Water System 
Installation and Operation, T.O. 40W4-21-1, Basic Expeditionary Airfield 
Resources (BEAR) Water System, and other technical orders listed in this 
chapter and Attachment 1 for additional information. 
3.2.1. ROWPU. The ROWPU is a mobile water purification unit that produces 
potable water by removing suspended and dissolved solids from seawater or 
fresh water. The 1500 ROWPU (Figure 3.1.) produces potable water at a 
capacity equal to or greater than 1500 gallons per hour (GPH), and requires up 
to 35 kilowatts (kW) of power from an external source. It can produce potable 
water for 20 hours per day; the remaining four hours are used for backwashing 
and maintenance. The ROWPU operation produces up to two gallons of brine 
water for each gallon of potable water. Brine water can be used for grounding 
pads, construction or dust control; piped into its own evaporation lagoon; or 
returned to a large body of water. The use of brine water for dust control must 
be approved by area medical authorities IAW AFMAN 48-138 (IP), Sanitary

3.2.3.2. 35-GPM Electric Pump Assembly. The 35-GPM pump assembly 
(Figure 3.5.) is powered by an electric motor coupled to a centrifugal, self-
priming pump. Two of these pumps are supplied with the BEAR water system. 
The first pump assembly is used to pump ROWPU wastewater to a waste 
disposal area when prime power is available. This pump is manually regulated 
for waste disposal operations. The second pump assembly is supplied with the 
Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem, and is used to pump 
potable water up to 2500 feet to fill the facility potable water storage tank. An

3.3. BEAR Sanitation Assets. The health and hygiene of troops in a deployed 
environment is always a major concern for supervisors and leaders. Sanitation 
facilities; such as shower and shave units, latrines, and laundries are essential for 
the health, morale, and safety of base personnel. The following paragraphs 
provide a brief description of BEAR sanitation assets. Refer to T.O. 35E35-5-1, 
Field-Deployable Latrine Assembly, T.O. 35E35-4-1, Shower Facility, Bare 
Base, T.O. 35E35-3-1, Shave Stand, Bare Base, T.O. 50D1-4-11, Self-Help 
Laundry, and other applicable technical data for detailed guidance on BEAR 
sanitation assets and facilities. 
3.3.1. Shower/Shave Units. Portable shower/shave units (Figure 3.15.) are 
included in the BEAR equipment packages. Each shower consists of a base 
assembly with two stalls, a top frame assembly with attached showerheads, side 
supports, and a fabric cover. Six shower units can be joined to make a 12-person 
facility. Doors are provided to close in the two open ends of the facility. The 
shave stand consists of a base unit with 3 sinks, a mirror back with 3 mirror 
surfaces, electric light, and 115 VAC outlet, and associated wiring harness and 
plumbing. Four shave stands are provided for each shower/shave facility. The 
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012    
46 
 
 
shower/shave facility is usually housed in a small shelter system or TEMPER 
tent. The kit requires one environmental control unit (ECU) for heating/cooling 
in extreme conditions. A locally purchased ventilation fan may be sufficient in 
moderate environmental conditions. Site the shower/shave unit on a relatively 
level surface that is free of debris. Construct a concrete floor for long-term 
deployments. Set up requires a minimum of four people approximately 6 hours 
(plus tent and water heater set up).  
Figure 3.15. Shower/Shave Unit. 
 
3.3.2. Field-Deployable Latrines. The field-deployable latrine consists of two 
latrine units. Each unit has six toilets, a urinal trough, two hand-washing sinks, 
pump unit, 500-gallon collapsible water tank, and a 360-gallon waste tank 
(Figure 3.16.). Setup (not including the shelter) takes two people about one 
hour. During the early stages of a deployment, the latrine can be operated in a 
stand-alone mode. That is, the water tank is periodically replenished and the 
waste tank is emptied using a wastewater disposal trailer. Once water and waste 
distribution systems are in place, the unit can be connected directly to the 
service lines. The latrine should be sited on a relatively level surface that is free 
of debris. Construct a concrete floor for long-term deployments.

3.3.3. Wastewater Disposal Trailer. The trailer is a 1,000-gallon mobile sewage 
tank and vacuum pump (Figure 3.17.) used for cleaning latrine holding tanks 
until they can be connected to the bare base distribution system. The trailer 
requires a heavy truck with a pintle hook for towing. Waste must be emptied 
into a lagoon, commercial sanitary sewer or uninhabited area downwind from 
the base and away from drinking water sources.

3.3.4. Self-Help Laundry. The self-help laundry (SHL) is designed for rapid 
deployment and continuous operation as a complete field laundry. It consists of 
five washers, five double stacked dryers, water heater, water tank, supply pump, 
drain pump, electrical distribution panels, hoses, valves, filters and electrical 
cables. The washers, dryers and electrical connection boxes are operated within 
an area approximately 32 feet long by 20 feet wide (small shelter system or 
TEMPER tent). The pumps, water heater, and tanks are positioned outside the 
tent. SHL components are illustrated in Figure 3.18. The set also includes 
benches, folding tables and temporary hanging racks.

Chapter 4 
MOBILE ELECTRIC POWER AND DISTRIBUTION 
4.1. General Information. Mobile electric power (MEP) generation and 
distribution is an important part of any bare base deployment operation (Figure 
4.1.). BEAR power generating systems consists of both prime power and tactical 
quiet generators (TQG).  
4.1.1. Individual or synchronized prime generators in a power plant provide 
high-voltage power to the BEAR electrical distribution systems. Although 
newer, more efficient prime power generators are being pursued, the MEP-012A 
continues to provide great service and is in widespread use around the globe. 
TQGs are lightweight, portable, diesel engine-driven generators that are fully 
enclosed, reliable, and quiet. These critical assets provide initial power before a 
primary power plant and distribution system are constructed. Afterwards, they 
provide backup power or power for remote facilities. BEAR TQGs include the 
MEP-805B and MEP-806B generator. 
4.1.2. The amount of electrical power required during a given deployment 
depends on the mission and population at that particular location. This chapter 
addresses current bare base power generation and distribution systems as well as 
older, legacy assets that may still be in use.

4.6. Generator Fuel Bladders. Collapsible, coated fabric fuel bladders are often 
used as an auxiliary fuel source for MEP generators (Figure 4.6.). This is 
especially true for high fuel-consumption prime power generators. The 10,000-
gallon bladder is most often used as the auxiliary fuel source for MEP-012A 
generators. When filled, the bladder assumes a “pillow” like shape. When not 
filled, the fuel bladder can be folded, rolled, and stored after cleaning. A 20-
foot-by-20-foot, 10,000-gallon bladder will support two MEP-12s for about 4-5 
days. See Chapter 7 for additional information on this and other non-BEAR fuel 
bladders. 
Figure 4.6.  Collapsible Fuel Bladder. 
 
4.7. Electrical Distribution Systems. The primary components of the BEAR 
electrical distribution system consists of power switching and distribution 
centers, distribution panels, and associated cables and connectors. For additional 
information see AFH 10-222, Volumes 5, Guide to Contingency Electrical 
Power System Installation; AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual

4.7.1. Primary Switching Center (PSC). The DRS Radian Model PSC (Figure 
4.7.) is a high-voltage switching station that receives 4,160 volt, 3-phase electric 
power from BEAR power units or commercial means through two high voltage 
load interrupting switch inputs. The PSC has four feeder circuits; each circuit is 
capable of feeding multiple secondary distribution centers (dependent on PSC 
power source and individual secondary distribution center load). It can also be 
connected to other PSCs through one of the high voltage fault interrupting 
switches, reducing outputs to three from each PSC. See Table 4.5. for additional 
characteristics and consult T.O. 35F14-1-1, Deployable Power Generation and 
Distribution System (DPGDS) for a Primary Switch (PS), for PSC operation and

4.7.2. Secondary Distribution Center (SDC). The SDC accepts primary power 
and reduces the voltage for distribution to outlet receptacles and on to facilities 
or equipment (Figure 4.8.). Primary power is provided by either commercial 
power plants, engine driven prime power generator sets or another SDC. If 
required, the primary input and transformer can be bypassed, so an SDC can be 
fed from a low-voltage generator and used only as a distribution center. Table 
4.6. lists additional characteristics. See T.O. 35CA2-2-17-1, Operation and 
Maintenance Manual, Secondary Distribution Center (SDC) 150 KVA

4.7.5. Power Cables and Connectors. Electrical power distribution cables and 
connectors are generally divided into two categories, primary and secondary 
cables.  
4.7.5.1. Primary Cable. Primary electrical distribution cables (#1/0 5-kV 
insulated aluminum wire) are used for high-voltage runs between generators, 
PDCs and SDCs. One cable is used for each of the three phases; it comes on a 
pallet with three 3,000-foot cable reels mounted side-by-side (Figure 4.11.). 
4.7.5.2. Secondary Cable. Secondary electrical power distribution cables are 3-
phase insulated cable, in pre-assembled lengths with cannon plug connectors at 
each end (Figure 4.12.). The 25-foot long, 200-amp cables are used to connect 
portable generators with SDCs. The 60-amp cable, either 50 feet or 100 feet 
long, connect SDCs and individual facility PDPs. Secondary cable runs should 
be limited to 150 feet to conserve cable and minimize voltage drop, but runs of 
up to 800 feet are acceptable when there is no practical alternative. Listed in 
Table 4.9. are approximate voltage drops at rated amperage and cable length. 
However, actual voltage drop will be affected by temperature and the quality of 
the connection made when mating the connectors (dirt, corrosion, and oil affect 
pin resistance).

4.8. Legacy Power Systems. Older, legacy model generators and power 
distribution systems help bridge the gap as newer, more efficient systems are 
brought into the BEAR inventory. This section addresses some of the BEAR 
legacy power systems still in operational service.  
4.8.1. MEP Generators. Currently, a few older model generators are still in use 
in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). Although not a complete list, some of 
these legacy generators and their characteristics are listed in Table 4.10.

HEATING, VENTILATION, AIR CONDITIONING, AND 
REFRIGERATION (HVAC/R) 
5.1. General Information. Heating, cooling, and ventilation systems are an 
integral part of BEAR equipment sets. There are several HVAC/R systems 
fielded (including current and legacy systems); however, through attrition and 
ongoing equipment modernization, many of the older systems are being replaced 
with systems that are more versatile. This chapter will address primary and 
legacy systems still in use. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 12, Guide To Bare 
Base Mechanical Systems, and applicable technical data for guidance on the 
installation, operation, and maintenance of these systems. 
5.2. Field-Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU). The FDECU is 
the primary BEAR ECU (Figure 5.1.). There are several different models 
fielded and each can be used to heat, cool, dehumidify, filter and circulate air in 
portable shelters and containers for personnel and equipment. If desired, the 
units can also admit fresh, outside air inside the shelter by adjusting the return 
air duct and flange. See Table 5.1. for basic characteristics and consult T.O. 
35E9-314-1, Field-Deployable Environmental Control Unit (Models FDECU-2,

5.8. TRICON Refrigerated Container System (TRCS). The TRCS will be 
fielded as a replacement for the ADR-300 refrigeration system in surface-
configured BOB UTCs. The ADR-300 will remain in the air UTCs and be 
replaced with the TRCS through attrition. The TRCS is made up of two 
principle components, a triple container (TriCon) and an integrated 
refrigeration/freezing/heating unit (referred to as "RU"). It is designed to be 
coupled to other TRCS and/or dry freight TriCons using eight approved 
interconnectors (NSN 3040-01-387-4048 or equivalent). When three TRCS 
and/or dry freight TriCons are coupled, the dimensions, tolerances, and diagonal 
differences are equivalent to specifications of a 20-foot insulated container. A 
typical TRCS is illustrated in Figure 5.7. See Table 5.7. for additional TRCS 
characteristics.

5.9. Legacy HVAC/R Systems. 
5.9.1. ECU-39. The Dash 39 (Figure 5.8.) was in widespread use until the 
FDECU became the primary ECU in the BEAR inventory. Some units may still 
be in service today. They are used to heat, cool, dehumidify, filter and circulate 
air in portable shelters and vans to meet the controlled environmental 
requirements of personnel and electronic equipment. The unit can be adjusted to 
admit fresh air at a controlled rate. Typically, the unit is located external to the 
controlled space and the conditioned air circulates through supply and return 
ducts. Approximate cooling capacity is 4.5 tons.  Approximate heating capacity 
is 9.6 kilowatts (down to approximately 30° F). This unit uses R-22, an ozone-
depleting refrigerant. 
Figure 5.8. ECU-39. 
 
5.9.2. 1200-Cubic Foot (CF) Refrigerator. This is a large refrigeration unit 
assembled on site from insulating panels, with a separate 18,000 BTUH 
refrigeration unit (Figure 5.9.). It supports food service operations and is 
approximately 13 feet wide, 17 feet long and 8 feet high. The unit requires at 
least 6 feet of clear space on the ends to allow for installation and ventilation of 
the condensers.

SPECIALIZED ASSETS 
6.1. General Information. Although specialized equipment items may be 
tasked individually, they are often packaged with shelters or deployed within 
various BEAR industrial operations and support packages. The following 
paragraphs provide a brief description of these specialized assets. 
6.2. Specialized Equipment and Systems. 
6.2.1. Remote Area Lighting System (RALS). Used for general lighting along 
the flightline, around petroleum, oil and lubricant (POL), liquid oxygen (LOX) 
plants, etc. It contains 13 telescopic two-lamp light poles, four 375-foot cable 
sets and an aluminum container/control box (Figure 6.1.). One light pole 
connects to the control box and the others every 125 feet along the cable sets. 
The RALS requires an outside power source, such as a generator or feed from a 
SDC. 
Figure 6.1. Remote Area Lighting System (RALS). 
 
6.2.2. TF-2 Light Cart. The TF-2 floodlight is used primarily for initial camp 
beddown, perimeter lighting and flightline use. It is a self-contained, mobile, 
power generating light source with a manually operated boom and an onboard 
generator. Capable of illuminating large work sites while providing 6 kW of 
electricity at 120 VAC (Figure 6.2.). 
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012    
74 
 
 
Figure 6.2. TF-2 Light Cart. 
 
6.2.3. AM-2 Aluminum Mats. These are two-inch thick interlocking aluminum 
panels normally used for aircraft parking ramps or pads, taxiways and hangar 
floors ((Figure 6.3.). However, AM-2 contained in BEAR UTCs is currently 
utilized for flooring in BEAR shelters and not for flightline operations. 
Individual sections are 2 feet wide, and either 6 feet or 12 feet long. AM-2 is 
typically shipped in bundles, each of which contains 4 short and 16 long 
sections, and will cover 432 square feet. For additional information, see T.O. 
35E2-2-7, AM-2 Airfield Landing Mat and Accessories.

6.2.4. Concertina Wire. This wire provides a personnel barrier for internal 
areas of the base, such as industrial and flightline operations or other critical, 
high value facilities, areas or infrastructure. Concertina wire packages consist of 
480 rolls of barrier wire (50 feet per roll) providing 8,000 linear feet of coverage 
(Figure 6.4.). This quantity of wire is not designed to provide perimeter barriers 
around an entire austere base. 
Figure 6.4. Moving Heavy Rolls of Concertina Wire. 
 
6.2.5. Air Compressors. Provides compressed air for hangars, garages, paint 
shops, pneumatic tools, greasing equipment, tire inflation and other equipment. 
Models include the electric-powered MB-8 (200 psi) and the diesel-driven MC-5 
(100 psi) and MC-2A (200 psi). Figure 6.5. is the MC-2A model

6.2.6. Camouflage Nets and Poles. BEAR camouflage sets includes 200 desert-
colored, lightweight radar scattering nets and 70 support systems to provide 
camouflage screening and shade for facilities and equipment. Each net is 
capable of covering approximately 200 square feet and the set can be configured 
to cover single or multiple structures. 
6.2.7. Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS). The EALS is a runway 
lighting system designed to be rapidly installed at contingency airfields or at 
other locations that need temporary airfield lighting (Figure 6.6.). It contains a 
complete lighting kit for runways up to 10,000 feet long and 150 feet wide. 
When installed, it provides runway edge lighting, approach lighting, 
threshold/end lighting, taxiway lighting, visual glide slope indication, Distance-
To-Go (DTG) marker lighting, and obstruction lighting. The system supports 
contingency operations at night and during periods of reduced visibility. The 
EALS is packaged on six mobile trailers and includes generators, cables, control 
panels, transformers and regulators. Under ideal conditions, a six-person crew 
using two general-purpose vehicles (e.g., 3⁄4 ton pickup, 1 ton, 1-1⁄2 ton trucks, 
etc.) can install a 50-foot by 5,000-foot minimum operating strip (MOS) in 
about 2.5 hours. Additional time is needed to securely mount and properly adjust 
precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights, and to anchor edge lights 
against jet blast from large aircraft. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 7 and T.O. 
35F5-3-17-1, Lighting System, Airfield, Emergency, A/E82U-2, for detailed 
guidance on installation and operation.

6.2.8. Expeditionary Airfield Lighting System (EALS II). The new EALS II 
system is designed as a replacement for the current EALS. The new modular 
system supports day and night operations and is night vision goggle (NVG) 
compatible. It uses light emitting diode (LED) technology and is battery 
powered with solar recharge or hardwired to a generator or commercial power. 
Table 6.1. highlights the four modules of the EALS II.

Module 3 Expands Module 2 in 2,500’ increments out to 15,000’ 
Module 4 Second approach light set for bi-directional operations 
6.2.9. A/M 32A-96 Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). The MAAS is 
an air and surface transportable, rapid installation emergency aircraft arresting 
system. It is a rotary friction-type energy absorber consisting of two identical 
units installed on each side of the runway. Each unit houses one BAK-12 rotary 
friction energy absorber. The BAK-12 aircraft arresting gear mounted on mobile 
trailers is for use with most fighters (Figure 6.7.). In its simplest configuration, 
the MAAS is unidirectional and can be rapidly moved and anchored adjacent to 
the runway on soil, asphalt or concrete by a crew of 6 personnel in 
approximately two hours. An upgrade kit (longer nylon tapes and lightweight 
fairlead beams, or mobile runway edge sheaves) allows the MAAS trailer units 
to be set back from the runway edge. This eliminates wingtip clearance concerns 
for large aircraft while providing bi-directional engagement capability. Refer to 
T.O. 3538-2-10-1, Arresting Systems, Aircraft, Mobile, and AFH 10-222, 
Volume 8, for detailed guidance on installation and operation.

6.2.9. Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen (SPEK). The SPEK (Figure 6.8.) 
is a complete food service facility capable of providing hot meals to 500 
personnel at a time. Once deployed the SPEK can be unpacked and assembled in 
one and one half hours. An additional two and one half hours are required to 
prepare a meal for 300 persons, using Utilized Group Rations-Heat and Serve 
(UGR-H & S). The SPEK can be deployed by air or ground transportation, and 
requires a minimum of 4 personnel to unpack, assemble, operate, and repack. 
The SPEK does not require outside power, having a 2KW Military Tactical 
Generator Set; however, all components operate on 120 VAC 50/60 Hz power, 
and can be powered by available local utilities or generators. Once set up the 
SPEK requires only potable water, fuel, rations, and water disposal. Refer to 
T.O. 35E4-235-1, Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen for detailed guidance on

Figure 6.8. Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen (SPEK). 
 
6.2.10. BEAR 550 Kitchen. The BEAR 550 kitchen (Figure 6.9.) is a complete 
portable food preparation and serving complex. It is designed to serve up to 550 
personnel and seat 120. That capacity is doubled (1100 personnel and 240 seats) 
when kitchens are combined. All tools, components and equipment, (except 
electrical and water supplies), that are required to unpack, set up, operate, 
maintain, strike, and repack the facility, are supplied in the shipping containers. 
Force Support personnel normally erect all tents associated with the kitchen; 
however, engineers provide supporting utility service (power, water and 
wastewater) and install some of the more complicated equipment items such as 
water heaters, walk-in refrigeration units and air conditioning units. The power 
distribution system takes electrical power from an external source and steps it 
down to the power level requirements of the various electric appliances and 
lights. The major components of the kitchen’s power distribution system include 
secondary distribution boxes, cable assemblies and lighting harnesses. Electrical 
power requirements are one 225-Amp, 208 VAC, 3 Phase, 60 Hz power source 
and two 150-KVA secondary distribution centers. The Advance Design 
Refrigerator (ADR) requires 208/230 VAC 60 HZ. Refer to Work Package 
(WP)-005 00, T.O. 35E4-169-31, BEAR Base Harvest Falcon/Eagle Electric 
Kitchen with Mess Kit Laundry, for more information on siting kitchen facilities.

NON-BEAR ASSETS 
7.1. General Information. In addition to BEAR assets, many other 
expeditionary equipment packages are required to support Air Force bare base 
operations. The owning functional area organizations deploy, set up and operate 
the assets, but typically require civil engineer support for sitting, site preparation 
and utility service. Engineers must work with representatives from the other 
functional areas to ensure optimum use of such packages. 
7.2. Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE). A 
mobile, air-transportable, aircraft and ground fuel delivery system that is 
designed to replace older and less efficient Fuels Mobility Support Equipment 
(FMSE). FORCE consists of a Trailer-Mounted Pumping Unit (R-18), a Trailer-
Mounted Filter Separator (R-19), a Multi-Aircraft Servicing Platform (R-20) and 
a Plumbing Assembly (R-21). The full capability mission of the complete 
FORCE System, when used in conjunction with fabric fuel bladders, provides a 
deployable, above-ground, constant pressure, flow-on demand fueling system 
for aircraft, i.e., a hydrant-type fueling system. Currently being fielded at 
numerous locations, FORCE fueling systems saves time and resources, and 
improves safety, reliability, and flexibility of the deployed fueling systems.  
7.2.1. R-18 Trailer-Mounted Pumping Unit. A trailer-mounted self-priming, 
air-eliminating pump (Figure 7.1.), offloads trucks at the base perimeter, 
delivers fuel through 6-inch hose lines to interim storage systems and provides 
fuel flow at 900 gpm/150 psi at a distance of 10,000 feet to the R-20 Multi-
Aircraft Servicing Platform. 
7.2.2. R-19 Trailer-Mounted Filter Separator. Designed to filter and separate 
particulate and water from fuel, the trailer-mounted R-19 (Figure 7.2.) weighs 
about 3,000 pounds and consists of two 600-gpm aluminum alloy filter 
separators. The separators are configured to run in parallel at 1200 gpm or 
individually at 600 gpm.

7.2.3. R-20 Multi-Aircraft Servicing Platform. The R-20 Multi-Aircraft 
Servicing Platform (Figure 7.3.) is the interface between one or two receiver 
aircraft. It has a combined fueling capability of 900 gpm through two 2.5-inch, 
60 foot semi-collapsible servicing hoses (450 gpm through each hose). The R-20 
is a trailer-mounted servicing platform and weighs about 4,600 lbs. It is air- 
transportable. 
Figure 7.3. R-20 Multi-Aircraft Servicing Platform. 
 
7.2.4. R-21 Portable Hydrant Mission Support Plumbing Assembly. The R-
21 plumbing assembly (Figure 7.4.) consists of all hoses, valves, adapters, 
couplings, and evacuation equipment necessary to connect the various 
components of the FORCE receipt, transfer, storage, filtration and issue systems. 
The plumbing assembly is packed in Tricon containers and is air transportable. 
7.2.5. Tactical Automated Service Station. The TASS (Figure 7.5.) is a 
trailer-mounted automated ground fuel issue point for vehicles and support 
equipment at deployed locations. It is capable of delivering DF-2, JP-8 and 
MOGAS at a minimum rate of ten gallons per minute (10 GPM) through each 
dispensing nozzle. The TASS provides an interface between bulk fuel transport 
trailers or other fuel sources and vehicles/support equipment requiring ground 
fuel.

7.3. Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE). While newer FORCE 
systems are being fielded, many FMSE assets still remain in service. FMSE 
assets are used to receive and issue fuel at bare bases and to augment locations 
with fixed-fuel facilities. Examples include the R-14 Air-Transportable Hydrant 
Refueling System (ATHRS), the R-22 Trailer Mounted Transfer Pump, and the 
FFU-15E Skid-Mounted Filter Separator. 
7.3.1. R-14 Air Transportable Hydrant Refueling System. The complete R-
14 system contains three identical self-sufficient modules. Each module consists 
of a diesel powered 600-gpm pump and filter separator, mounted on a four-
wheeled trailer, with associated valves, hoses, adapters, meter and two 50,000-
gallon bladders (Figure 7.6.). Each R-14 module can refuel or defuel one heavy 
aircraft at 600 gpm or two fighter aircraft at 200 gpm. 
Figure 7.6. R-14 Transportable Hydrant Refueling System. 
 
7.3.2. R-22 Trailer-Mounted Transfer Pump. This is a trailer mounted, diesel 
powered 600-gpm pump (Figure 7.7.). It is typically used in conjunction with 
an FFU-15E filter separator to pump fuel from bulk storage tanks, fuel trucks or 
tanker aircraft to the R-14’s 50,000-gallon bladders. The R-22 can also be used 
with a hose cart or skid-mounted filter separator to deliver fuel directly to 
aircraft or refueling vehicles.

7.3.4. GRU-17E Aircraft Fuel-Servicing Unit. A caster mounted swivel-joint 
framework and fueling hoses to provide the R-14 with hot refueling capability 
(Figure 7.9.). The GRU-17E is a portable pantograph designed for refueling 
tactical aircraft during hot refueling operations (refueling aircraft with engine 
running or simultaneous weapons loading).  It consists of four sections of pipe 
connected with swivel joints and mounted on casters.  It is fully equipped with 
all components needed to operate the unit and only requires a fuel source for 
operation 
Figure 7.9. GRU-17E Aircraft Fuel-Servicing Unit. 
 
7.3.5. PMU-27M Pumping Assembly. A trailer-mounted, engine powered unit 
consisting of a 50-gpm pump, filter separator, with associated hoses, 
connections, nozzles and meter (Figure 7.10.). It is used to service small aircraft 
or vehicles, or transfer fuel into or out of four 55-gallon drums simultaneously, 
pumping from an external source and defueling aircraft auxiliary tanks. The unit 
is also a ground fuels-dispensing unit.

7.4. Fuel Bladders. Fuel bladders generally range in capacity from 500 gallons 
to 210,000 gallons (Figure 7.11.). Typically, 10,000-gallon fuel bladders are 
used at low-demand sites such as vehicle refueling points. Larger 50,000-gallon 
fuel bladders support aircraft fuel storage and refueling and are commonly found 
with the R-14 refueling unit. The 210,000-gallon bladders are used for bulk fuel 
storage. Additional fuel bladder details are listed in Table 7.1. Refer to T.O. 
37A12-15-1, Collapsible Fuel Bladders, for additional information relating to 
operation, service, repair, and berm construction details.

7.5. Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) Facilities. EMEDS Facilities 
(Figure 7.12.) consist of expandable equipment packages that range from a 
basic, rapid response facility to a 114-bed Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH). 
Generally, AF beddowns are served by an EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH (described 
below) or smaller facility with no specialty UTCs attached. However, in a 
mature theater a broader range of care and services are usually centralized at key 
locations. EMEDS are equipped and staffed to provide medical support only, 
and is therefore dependent on CE and other base agencies for support. The 
following paragraphs provide a brief overview of EMEDS facilities. Refer to 
AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5, for more information on EMEDS.   
Figure 7.12. Expeditionary Medical Support Facility. 
 
7.5.1. EMEDS Basic. A four-bed clinic, deployable in initial and follow-on 
increments to provide primary medical and dental care, preventive medicine, 
environmental health, stabilization and medical evacuation preparation for up to 
2,000 personnel. Initial module should be operational within 12 hours of arrival. 
Full deployment includes three small shelters with ECUs. The clinic requires a 
15,000 sq ft site, 65 kW of power, 400 gallons per day (gpd) of potable water, 
1,000 pounds of laundry service per week, biohazard waste disposal and lodging 
for 25 personnel.  
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012 
91 
 
 
7.5.2. EMEDS+10 Bed AFTH. This is a 10-bed AFTH. It is a modular add-on 
expansion of EMEDS Basic to support up to 3,000 personnel, including surgical 
and specialty care. It includes an additional three small shelters with ECUs. 
Total requirements increase to a 26,000 sq ft site, 100 kW of power, 800 gpd of 
potable water, 85 pounds per day (ppd) of ice, laundry service, biohazard waste 
disposal and lodging for 56 people. 
7.5.3. EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH. This is a 25-bed AFTH. It is a modular add-on 
expansion of EMEDS+10, to support up to 5,000 personnel. It includes an 
additional three small shelters with ECUs. Its total requirements increase to 
40,000 sq ft site, 200 kW of power, 1,430 gpd of potable water, 150 ppd of ice, 
laundry service, biohazard waste disposal and lodging for 86 people.  
7.5.4. EMEDS+50 Bed AFTH. An estimated seven additional small shelters are 
included in this expansion. Total requirements increase to 50,000 sq ft site, 200 
kW of power, 5,500 gpd of potable water, 300 ppd of ice, laundry service, 
biohazard waste disposal and lodging for 115 people.  
7.5.5. EMEDS+114 Bed AFTH. An estimated 16 additional small shelters is 
included in this expansion. This is the maximum anticipated size for an 
expeditionary medical facility. Estimated requirements are an 110,000 sq ft site, 
200 kW of power, 11,000 gpd of potable water, 675 ppd of ice, laundry service, 
biohazard waste disposal and lodging for 300 personnel.  
7.6. Aeromedical Staging Facility (ASF). The ASF is an evacuation hospital 
capable of receiving and evacuating 250 injured or ill personnel every 24 hours 
(Figure 7.13.). It is comprised of TEMPER tents and requires a 90,000 sq ft site, 
200 kW of power, 12,000 gpd of potable water, 1250 ppd of ice, laundry 
service, biohazard waste disposal and lodging for medical staff. 
7.7. Transportable Blood Transshipment Center (TBTC). The TBTC is a 
small facility used to store and ship frozen and liquid blood products and is 
normally collocated with medical facilities near a major airfield. It requires two 
Small Shelters, TEMPER tents, or ISO container shelters and a 4,000 sq ft site, 
200 kW of power, 300 gpd of potable water, 800 ppd of ice and lodging for 12 
personnel.

Figure 7.13. Aeromedical Staging Facility. 
 
7.8. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs). Navigational aids refer to the ground 
equipment and supporting facilities that provide electronic (radio and radar) 
assistance in the navigation of aircraft. Communications personnel install and 
operate NAVAIDs such as Tactical Air Navigation, Radar Approach Control or 
Precision Approach Radar, mobile microwave landing system, and mobile tower 
and communications equipment. These assets are not part of BEAR packages; 
however, engineers will provide site preparation and utilities. The footprint of 
many deployed NAVAIDs is determined during pre-survey coordination 
meetings, but siting generally requires a suitably sized cleared area on level 
ground with electrical power and vehicle access. Below are several types of 
deployable NAVAIDs that will usually require site preparation at contingency 
locations: 
7.8.1. AN/TPN-19 Landing Control Central (Radar Set). The AN/TPN-19 
radar set (Figure 7.14.) can be configured as a complete radar approach control 
(RAPCON) or ground controlled approach (GCA) facility. With all indicators 
and communications equipment operational, the unit is capable of taking over 
air traffic control (ATC) operations at busy airports. Depending on antenna 
location, the precision approach radar (PAR) system is capable of providing 
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012 
93 
 
 
service for up to four runways, but the unit can provide approach guidance to 
only one runway at a time. Normally, ten maintenance personnel can install this 
system in about 26 hours, not including site survey. However, during 
contingency situations with no augmentees assigned, the standard setup time is 
36 hours. 
Figure 7.14. Landing Control Central Surveillance Radar System. 
 
7.8.2. AN/MPN-14K Landing Control Central (Radar Set). This unit can also 
be configured as a complete RAPCON or GCA facility. However, the set is 
limited to a single runway but has the capability of providing opposite direction 
runway operations with the aid of a transportable turntable. Ten maintenance 
personnel and six controllers are needed to install the system within 26 hours.  
7.8.3. AN/TSW-7 Mobile Control Tower. The AN/TSW-7 mobile control 
tower (Figure 7.15.) provides ATC capabilities where no control tower exists 
(bare base operations) or where the fixed control tower is not operational. The 
unit has limited capabilities; however, it provides controllers with the minimum 
items necessary to rapidly launch and recover (to include silent launches) 
participating aircraft in the most expeditious manner. Seven maintenance 
personnel should have the mobile tower operational within 16 hours. 
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012    
94 
 
 
7.8.4. AN/TRN-45 Mobile Microwave Landing System (MMLS). The MMLS 
(Figure 7.16.) is a lightweight, transportable ground-based precision guidance 
approach system for MLS avionics equipped aircraft. Normal setup is a 
collocated configuration where elevation and azimuth antennas are situated 
together at the typical ILS glide slope antenna location. Three trained personnel 
can set up the MMLS in a co-located configuration in 60 minutes. Set up in a 
split-site configuration will take 2 hours (times do not include site survey or 
transportation time). 
7.8.5. AN/TRN-26 Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN). The AN/TRN-26 
TACAN (Figure 7.17.) system is designed for use at remote landing strips and 
forward operating areas. The system provides radio navigation information 
(bearing, identification, and distance). Maintenance personnel can have the 
TACAN operational within 4 hours. 
7.8.6. AN/TRN-41 TACAN. The AN/TRN-41 is a portable, lightweight, air 
droppable, unmanned TACAN designed to provide bearing, facility 
identification, and distance information. The TACAN transmits continuous 
bearing information to an unlimited number of aircraft and provides slant range 
distance information. Three trained personnel should have the system 
operational in 4 hours.

7.9. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Containers. 
These facilities serve as their own shipping container and as a shelter once 
deployed. Commonly sized at 8 feet x 8 feet x 20 feet, some are expandable to 
provide about 400 square feet. They are normally used for specialized purposes 
such as hospital operating rooms or command posts. 
7.10. Expandable Light Air Mobile Shelter (ELAMS). The ELAMS is an all-
purpose soft-walled shelter used as maintenance shops, control centers, storage, 
office area, etc. (Figure 7.18.). Standard expanded configuration is 14.8 feet 
long by 20.25 feet wide by 8 feet high. The shelter has a 120/208 VAC, 60-
cycle, 3-phase, 5-wire electrical input. A minimum of five personnel can safely 
assemble the structure in about six hours (30 labor hours). See Table 7.2. for 
environmental limitations.

7.11. K-Span Structures. This is an arched building made on-site from rolls of 
galvanized steel (Figure 7.19.) using an air-transportable trailer-mounted 
automatic building machine. The machine forms structural arches in any desired 
span between 12 ft and 80 ft, as well as straight sections for end walls. The 
arches and end wall sections are then erected onto a concrete foundation and 
seamed together using a portable electric seaming machine. The continuous 
seams eliminate the need for fasteners, thereby simplifying construction and 
making the building watertight. The facilities are commonly used as storage 
buildings or maintenance shops and are typically constructed by RED HORSE 
personnel.  
Figure 7.19. K-Span Facility Under Construction. 
 
7.12. Revetments. Revetments are theater WRM assets used to protect parked 
aircraft or other high-value resources. B-1 revetments are assembled from 
corrugated steel panels into sections 6 feet 11 inches wide, 12 feet long, and 16 
feet high. A single B-1 kit provides enough panels for twenty-one 12-foot 
sections, for a total length of 252 feet. Sections can be joined end to end for 
straight revetments, or butted together at right angles for "U" shapes, "E" shapes, 
etc. (see Figure 7.20. for a typical B-1 Revetment layout). One kit will protect 
one fighter in "U" shape and flow-thru designs. For clustered arrangements, 
three kits will protect four fighters. Fill revetments with earth and cap to prevent 
dust from blowing out or water from accumulating. See T.O. 35E4-170-2, 
Aircraft Revetment Kit, Type B-1, and AFPAM 10-219, Volume 2, for 
construction details.

7.13. Force Provider Facilities and Equipment. This is a US Army 
expeditionary infrastructure package, normally used at theater reception points, 
intermediate staging bases, disaster relief operations or in other situations where 
relatively stable and robust expeditionary infrastructure is appropriate. A single 
Force Provider set includes all materiel necessary to provide quality food, 
billeting and hygiene services for 550 personnel (Figure 7.21.). TEMPER tents, 
environmental control units, 60 kW tactical quiet generators, 20,000-gallon 
water bladders, 400-gallon water buffalo trailers, floodlights and wastewater 
disposal vacuum pump trailers are compatible with Air Force BEAR equipment. 
However, Force Provider utility distribution systems and containerized shower, 
latrine and laundry units are not directly compatible with BEAR utility systems, 
and may need locally developed adapters or fittings. Force Provider sets are 
typically erected by Quartermaster companies. If required, water production 
(ROWPUs) and high-voltage power production (MEP-012s) are provided by 
specialized units.

Terms 
Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)—A field operating 
agency (FOA) located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Readiness 
Support Division (HQ AFCESA/CEX) acts as the Air Force program manager 
for Base Civil Engineer (BCE) Contingency Response Planning. 
Bare Base—An installation having minimum essential facilities to house, 
sustain, and support operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway, 
taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a source of water 
that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base 
conditions form a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base. 
Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR)—Facilities, equipment, and 
basic infrastructure to support the beddown of deployed forces and aircraft at 
austere locations; a critical capability to fielding expeditionary aerospace forces. 
Also known as BEAR, the resources include tents, field kitchens, latrine systems, 
shop equipment, electrical and power systems, runway systems, aircraft shelters, 
and water distribution systems needed to sustain operations.  
Beddown—A location at which a deploying unit operates during a contingency. 
It is usually, but not always, in the area of responsibility. 
Logistics Module (LOGMOD). A computer software program that is used to 
manage logistics equipment and supply database for Air Force Unit Type Codes 
(UTCs). 
Minimum Aircraft Operating Surface—The minimum surface on an airfield 
which is essential for the movement of aircraft. It includes the aircraft dispersal 
areas, the minimum operating strip, and the taxiways between them. 
 
 
 
AFH10-222 Volume 2, 6 February 2012    
110 
 
 
Minimum Operating Strip—A runway which meets the minimum 
requirements for operating assigned and/or allocated aircraft types on a 
particular airfield at maximum or combat gross weight. 
Solar Load—The increase in temperature for a room or building generated by 
the sun's rays.
