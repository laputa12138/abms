Preface 
This publication provides the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) associated with installation planning 
and preparedness for response to, and recovery from, hazards to save lives, protect property, and sustain 
mission readiness; and defines the roles of the Department of Defense (DOD) installation commanders and 
staffs in completing those tasks. The purpose of this multi-service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) 
publication is to summarize existing policies, responsibilities, and procedures for emergency management 
(EM) programs at DOD installations worldwide for all-hazards, as defined by DOD Instruction (DODI) 
6055.17, DOD Emergency Management (EM) Program, and to translate this policy into tactical terms 
applicable to military installation commanders. The contents have been written to complement Service EM 
program manuals, standing operating procedures (SOP), response standards, training support packages, 
collective task training development products, training center and unit exercises, and Service school curricula 
related to EM. 
The principal audience for this MTTP is military installation commanders, functional and Service component 
staffs, installation emergency managers, nonemergency management personnel performing collateral or 
additional EM duties, and civil service and contract EM personnel with application to the joint force 
command and joint task force that are tasked with the planning, preparation, and execution of EM. Trainers 
and educators throughout DOD will also use this MTTP. 
Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure their decisions and actions comply with applicable United 
States (U.S.), international, and, in some cases, host nation (HN) laws and regulations. Commanders at all 
levels ensure their subordinates operate in accordance with the law of war and the applicable rules of 
engagement. (See JP 1-04, Legal Support to Military Operations.) 
This MTTP uses joint terms identified in the DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms where 
applicable. Selected joint and Service terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. Terms 
for where this MTTP is the proponent of a term (the authority) are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. 
For definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized, and the number of the proponent follows the 
definition. This publication is not the proponent for any new terms. 
This MTTP applies to installation populations in their entirety, including active, guard, and reserve 
component military personnel unless otherwise stated; DOD civilians; military families; installation tenants; 
transient military or U.S. government personnel; contractor personnel; visitors and guests; HN personnel; 
third country national personnel; and other relevant populations in the surrounding community outside of the 
installation.

Introduction 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Emergency Management (EM) Program discusses 
the principles of EM as they apply to military installations. This publication provides doctrine TTP for 
building, sustaining, and delivering core capabilities needed to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, 
and recover from any threat or hazard. During military operations, this publication is subordinate to current 
joint publications (JP) that address related topics, such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 
(CBRN) passive defense, consequence management, and defense support of civil authorities (DSCA). It 
covers all-hazards and coordinating operations, such as emergency support functions (ESF) or functional 
areas. 
EM involves the complex coordination of planning and response efforts with the installation command and 
staff; tenant command staff; and local, tribal, state, Federal, and HN civilian authorities. Tenant and transient 
installation units also actively contribute resources to the Emergency Management Plan (EMP). Installation 
commands strive to become familiar with the local community outside the installation that will impact EM 
operations. They are also knowledgeable of the relationship of their operations to Federal guidelines 
governing civilian EM at national, state, and local levels. 
This document addresses the various roles of the installation command for each phase of an EM life cycle. 
The primary overlapping phases in an EM life cycle are— 

Preventing acts of terrorism.

Protecting missions, personnel, equipment, and infrastructure during installation emergencies.

Mitigating installation emergencies.

Responding to installation emergencies.

Recovering from installation emergencies.
Note. Multiple reference documents are still current and there is a mix of terminology. For the 
purpose of this document, Mission Areas and Phases are considered to be synonymous. 
This edition incorporates policy revisions from DODI 6055.17. The previous construct of EM with four 
phases (prepare, respond, recover, and mitigate) has been changed to five mission areas (prevent, protect, 
respond, recover, and mitigate). These changes align with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
doctrine and contribute to interoperability with nonmilitary entities at the Federal, state, and local levels. 
Other changes incorporate lessons learned from incidents in both military and civilian sectors, adjustments 
based on advances in technology, and emerging threats from competitors. 
While the EMP covers the usual activities associated with preventing, protecting, responding to, recovering 
from, and mitigating the effects of an incident, the installation command and EM staffs also coordinate EM 
activities with various supporting entities established on and off the installation. Plans for the coordination 
and execution of ESFs or functional areas, continuity of operations (COOP), and critical infrastructure 
protection (CIP) are aligned with the EMP to ensure the appropriate allocation of resources and manpower 
in all sectors of emergency response.

Chapter 1 
Fundamentals of Emergency Management 
This chapter establishes the environment for emergency managers. It provides the 
terms, references, and framework for EM; prevention, preparedness, mitigation, 
response, and recovery from an incident. It discusses the interface between military 
doctrine and Federal guidance, such as, the National Preparedness System to enable a 
collaborative and coordinated approach to achieving a more resilient installation from 
all-hazards. It also presents an overview of the anticipated tasks and responsibilities of 
installation command and staff in the construction and proliferation of an EM program. 
These fundamental principles guide the preparation for, and implementation of, the EM 
program discussed in following chapters. 
NATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT 
1-1. 
Consistent with DODI 6055.17, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-5, Management of
Domestic Incidents, and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-8, National Preparedness, EMPs for domestic
installations are developed in compliance with National Incident Management System (NIMS), incident
command system (ICS), National Planning Framework (NPF), and National Preparedness Goal (NPG)
procedures. Also consistent with DODI 6055.17, installations outside the U.S. implement NPR and NIMS
principles as much as possible when executing EM programs.
1-2. 
The national structure for incident management establishes a clear progression of coordination and
communication from the local level to regional and national headquarters levels. Specific elements of this
governing structure are detailed in the following sections.
NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (NIMS) 
1-3. 
The NIMS process supports the following—

Integrating incident-related prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery activities.

Improving coordination and integration within the military operational area and with Federal,
state, local private-sector, and nongovernmental organization partners.

Increasing the efficient use of resources needed for more effective incident management.

Improving situational awareness (SA) within the installation.

Providing timely and accurate information for public awareness.

Facilitating requests for assistance that exceed the installation response capability.

Providing linkage to technical reachback capabilities.

Ensuring an integrated, familiar approach across emergency responders to maintain connectivity
and SA.
INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM (ICS) 
1-4. 
The ICS is a flexible, standardized, on-scene, all-hazards incident management approach. It is executed 
and prioritized according to the principles of life safety, incident stabilization, environmental and property
conservation.
1-5. 
The ICS enables the coordination and integration of personnel, facilities, procedures, communications,
and equipment among various jurisdictions and functional agencies. It also establishes a common process for

1-2
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
planning and managing resources. This system includes five major functional areas, staffed as needed, for a 
given incident:  command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration. 
NATIONAL PLANNING FRAMEWORKS (NPF) 
1-6. 
The frameworks describe how the whole community works together to achieve the NPG. There is one
framework for each of the five mission areas:  prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. The
intended audience is individuals, families, communities, the private and nonprofit sectors, faith-based
organizations, and state, local, tribal, territorial, and Federal governments.
NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS GOAL (NPG) 
1-7. 
PPD-8 sets a strategic vision for national preparedness by using a comprehensive approach to
preparedness. It also requires the development and maintenance of the NPG.
1-8. 
The NPG defines the core capabilities necessary to prepare for the incidents that pose the greatest risk
to national security. The NPG establishes concrete, measurable, prioritized objectives to mitigate specific
threats and vulnerabilities—including regional variations of risk—and emphasizes actions intended to achieve
an integrated, layered, accessible, and all-of-nation/whole community preparedness approach while
optimizing the use of available resources. The NPG organizes the core capabilities into five mission areas:
prevention, protection, response, recovery and mitigation. These coincide with the framework described in
paragraph 1-12 and chapters 2 through 5.
MISSION ANALYSIS 
1-9. 
The overarching objective of a comprehensive, all-hazards EM program is to maintain DOD readiness
and sustain mission assurance throughout, and subsequent to, disasters or emergencies on or near DOD
installations worldwide. The goals of the DOD EM program are to—

Prevent and protect DOD installations from imminent acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or
hazards.

Stabilize the incident to protect personnel, save lives, and protect property and the environment.

Recover and restore operations after an emergency.
1-10. It is also DOD policy that EM programs—

Maintain DOD readiness and sustain mission assurance by establishing and maintaining a
comprehensive, all-hazards EM program.

Support and assist civil authorities, as directed, in EM activities.

Coordinate preparedness, response, and recovery requirements and capabilities with state, local,
and tribal governments; other military departments; or HN partners by using an all-hazards
approach that balances risk management (threat, vulnerability, consequence), resources, and need.

Align with Federal guidance, which is outlined in the NIMS, ICS, and NPF and is consistent with
HSPD-5.
TERMS OF REFERENCE 
1-11. The following terms of reference and complementary doctrine apply throughout this document—

All-hazards. As outlined by PPD-21, Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience, the term
all-hazards means a threat or an incident, natural or manmade, that warrants action to protect life,
property, the environment, and public health or safety, and to minimize disruptions of government,
social, or economic activities. It includes natural disasters, cyber incidents, industrial accidents,
pandemics, acts of terrorism, sabotage, and destructive criminal activity targeting critical
infrastructure.

CBRN response. CBRN response provides the operational framework for authorized measures
DOD undertakes in preparation for anticipated CBRN incidents to minimize the loss of life and
property and to assist with the response and any required short-term recovery. It considers the total
capabilities and limitations beyond civil authorities, up through state and Federal response.


EM. EM is the coordination and integration of all activities necessary to build, sustain, and
improve the capabilities to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, or mitigate
against threatened or actual natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other manmade disasters.

EM alignment with CBRN defense activities. EM is not a military-unique function and is
complementary to CBRN defense activities. EMPs are developed in coordination with CBRN
defense plans, including the recognition of potentially overlapping capabilities and resources. EM
capabilities and functions are not exempt from applicable Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) standards, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
guidelines, or the guidelines of other applicable Federal and HN agencies. Additional information
can be found in ATP 3-11.41/MCRP 10-10E.6/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP 3-2.37IP, Multiservice
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
Consequence Management Operations.

Geographic locations. U.S. military installations support operational forces in domestic and
foreign environments. The installation location is critical in determining the laws and regulations
that must be applied and in establishing the level of military authority that the installation
commander may have in determining response actions, including the level of personal protection
for the response force.

Domestic locations. Domestic locations are the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the U.S. territories of Guam, American
Samoa, Jarvis Island, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, the Freely Associated
States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the U.S.
possessions of Wake Island, Midway Island, Johnson Island, Baker Island, Howland Island,
Palmyra Atoll, and Kingman Reef. Northern Command is responsible for continental U.S., Alaska,
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indo-Pacific Command is
responsible for Hawaii and the rest of the territories and possessions listed above. (DODI 2000.21,
DOD Support to International Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear [CBRN]
Incidents)

Foreign locations. Foreign locations are any geographic area not reflected in the definition of
domestic. (DODI 2000.21)

Incident commander (IC). According to NIMS and the ICS, the IC is the individual responsible
for on-scene incident activities, including developing incident objectives and ordering and
releasing resources. The IC has overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident
operations. (NIMS)

Installations. All DOD facilities, activities, reservations, and enduring bases, worldwide across all
commands and organizations at multiple echelons, including government-owned facilities and
facilities operated by contractors for DOD, and non-DOD activities operating on DOD
installations. Includes locations supporting contingency operations according to Military
Department/Service guidance. (DODI 6055.17)
FRAMEWORK 
1-12. Chapters 2 through 5 describe the mission areas of EM that can occur sequentially or simultaneously
before during or after an emergency incident (see figure 1-1). The following are the mission areas of EM:
prevent, protect, respond, recover, and mitigate.

Figure 1-1. The five mission areas of EM 
PREVENT 
1-13. Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves
actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and other information to a range of
activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened inspections; improved
surveillance and security operations; investigations to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public
health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and, as
appropriate, specific law enforcement (LE) operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting, or
disrupting illegal activity and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice.
PROTECT 
1-14. A continuous cycle of planning, organizing, training, equipping, exercising, evaluating, and taking
corrective action in an effort to ensure effective coordination during incident response. Protection focuses on
the following elements:  planning; procedures and protocols; training and exercises; personnel qualification
and certification; and equipment certification. The EMP drives protection efforts and facilitates response and
recovery operations. Preparation and planning are based on an assessment of the operational environment
(OE). Operational assessments enable commanders and emergency managers to identify the minimum
standards for training, organizing, equipping, and protecting resources. The implementation and approval of
the EM plan (and related agreements) increase readiness through training and exercises. Chapter 2 discusses
the prevention and protection phases in more detail.
RESPOND 
1-15. Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response includes immediate
actions to save lives, protect property and the environment, stabilize the incident, and meet basic human needs.
Response also includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of mitigation activities designed to
limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the

consequences of an incident; increased security operations; continuing investigations into nature and source 
of the threat; ongoing public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, 
isolation, or quarantine; and specific LE operations aimed at preempting, interdicting, or disrupting illegal 
activity, and apprehending actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Chapter 3 discusses the response 
phase in more detail. 
RECOVER 
1-16. The development, coordination, and execution of plans to restore sites and services for impacted
communities; and the reconstitution of government operations and services through individual, private-sector,
nongovernmental, and public assistance programs. These entities identify needs and define resources; provide
housing and promote restoration; address long-term care and treatment of affected persons; implement
additional measures for community restoration; incorporate mitigation measures and techniques, as feasible;
evaluate the incident to identify lessons learned; and develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future
incidents. The recovery phase also includes completing the mitigation of the immediate hazard. Chapter 4
discusses the recovery phase in more detail.
MITIGATE 
1-17. Activities providing a critical foundation in the effort to reduce the loss of life and property from
natural/manmade disasters by avoiding or lessening the impact of a disaster and providing value to the public
by creating safer communities. Mitigation seeks to fix the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and
repeated damage. These activities or actions, in most cases, will have a long-term sustained effect. Chapter 5
discusses the mitigation phase in more detail.
OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT (OE) 
1-18. Commanders analyze their OE to identify those characteristics of possible significance or relevance to
the installation and its mission. Certain characteristics of the OE may take on added significance based on the
missions assigned to the installation’s tenants. See JP 2-01.3 Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational
Environment, for additional information on analyzing the significant characteristics of the OE.
SUMMARY 
1-19. Installation commanders align their EM processes using the guiding national principles found in
National Preparedness System documents. All EMP and activities comply with this guidance. This manual
promulgates a comprehensive, all-hazards EM framework consisting of five integrated phases: prevent,
protect, respond, recover, and mitigate. In the planning and execution of an EM program, installation
commanders consider the unique factors of their own OE.

Prevent and Protect 
Prevention and protection are two of the mission areas of the NPG. Key prevention 
and protection includes planning. Planning should include collection, evaluation, 
training and dissemination of operational information to respond to an incident. 
Prevention activities are designed to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an 
incident from occurring. Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. It 
also involves applying information to a range of activities that may include such 
countermeasures as:  deterrence operations; heightened inspections; improved 
surveillance and security operations; investigations to determine the full nature and 
source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; 
immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific LE operations 
aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting, or disrupting illegal activity and 
apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice. It consists of the 
activities that occur before the onset of an incident or event to prepare personnel, 
installation tenants, emergency responder elements, and the base population for the 
eventual response to, and recovery from, an emergency. These activities may decrease 
the effects of a hazard or threat, decrease the likelihood of occurrence, and/or increase 
the resilience of the installation. Activities completed during these phases include— 

Planning.

Reconnaissance.

Interagency coordination.

Training, exercises, and evaluation.

Resource management.

Instilling community awareness.

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
2-3. 
Installation commanders develop, implement, and sustain EM programs to encompass all hazards. The
goals of each program include hazard mitigation, preventing, preparing for, responding appropriately to, and
recovering from emergencies.
INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PLANNING 
2-4. 
Commanders emphasize both planning and response to provide unity of effort, efficient allocation of
resources, and early identification of shortfalls. Force survivability and mission continuation are the highest
priorities for planning. Plans should describe how personnel, equipment, and other resources are used to
support incident management, emergency response, and critical military operations. Plans should incorporate
Chapter 2 
2-4

assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and hazards, as well as provide information on how the installation 
would prevent, prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the items identified through the assessment 
process. Additionally, during the planning process, installations must conduct capabilities-based planning. 
CAPABILITIES-BASED PLANNING 
2-5. 
Through capabilities-based planning, the DOD agencies are able to identify needs, allocate resources,
and track activities and outcomes as they relate to the protection of installations and personnel and prevent a
potential incident from occurring. More information is available in Appendix F.
CRISIS ACTION PLANNING 
2-6. 
In an urgent operational need, planners and operators are required to go through the capabilities-based
plans in a compressed timeframe to see if there are any viable courses of action. However, if no options are
viable, new courses of action and a concept of operations (CONOPS) should be developed. The EMP will be
referenced to assist with planning and keeping the crisis management team (CMT)/crisis action team (CAT),
emergency operations center (EOC), and response forces familiar with the procedures, policies, and
installation response capabilities that assist with rapid development Incident Action Plans (IAP).
KEY PERSONNEL 
2-7. 
The installation emergency manager is the day-to-day coordinator of the installation EM program and
is essential to the success of each program.
2-8. 
Each EM program categorizes personnel by using the definitions outlined in DODI 60551.17 to
identify and manage personnel resources of emergency responders, first responders, critical personnel, and
essential personnel.
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WORKING GROUP (EMWG) 
2-9. 
The EMWG is a key element of the EM program and provides a mechanism for coordination of
installation functions and delineation of EM responsibilities within the installation. The EMWG—

Is established under the direction of the installation commander and the installation emergency
manager.

Meets at least quarterly.

See DODI 6055.17, table 1, for the suggested members.

Ensures the activities associated with establishing and sustaining the EM program are performed
according to this and other appropriate instructions and directives.
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER (EOC) 
2-10. An EOC is the distinctive location at which the coordination of information and resources to support
the IC or Unified Command (UC) occur. The EOC is activated to provide coordinated support to personnel at
the scene of the incident. EOC personnel consolidate and exchange information, support decision making,
coordinate resources, and assist in determining current and future incident needs.
2-11. The EOC consists of personnel and equipment appropriate for the incident level and can manage
multiple incidents and planned events.
2-12. The EOC is usually located near the center of the base or installation, close to the administrative offices
and other emergency services such as fire response and medical services. This enables prompt response for
commanders, support personnel, and emergency response team members. EOC management administrative
offices are located in the EOC, and all EOC team members have rapid access to the EOC. Base commander
offices are usually nearby. Careful consideration of the EOC location with respect to supplemental EOC staff
resource locations, will allow for a timely response. Such a location and the day-to-day use of the EOC help
ensure the immediate availability of key personnel and communications.

Note. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-141-04, Emergency Operations Center Planning and 
Design, is the DOD source document for establishing and updating an installation EOC according 
to HSPD-5. 
2-13. If a risk area is identified, the EOC is located away from the area of highest risk. Risk areas may
include: major fault lines; flood surge zones; floodplains; dam inundation zones; fire pathways; central areas
subject to conflagration; avalanche paths; areas of unstable soil; hazardous materials (HAZMAT) production
or storage facilities; nuclear plants, waste storage, or transportation pathways; and railways that transport
HAZMAT. The following are additional location considerations—

Determine the level of mitigation that may be required in response to the hazard if the location
options place the EOC within:

A hazard source zone.

The explosive safety quantity distance arc.

A prescribed 10-mile radius of a nuclear power plant emergency planning zone.

Identify utility locations, including underground and overhead lines for electrical power, water
supply, sewer, gas or petroleum, communications, and other utilities that may be in the planning
zone.

Ensure the EOC is located in an area where it can be secured.

Identify site perimeters, perimeter barriers and fences, control gates, and other means of securing
site perimeters.

Make soil bores to determine subgrade conditions that could impact EOC survivability in a natural
disaster or manmade incident.

Identify where the command administration is located, and provide access for military command
personnel to the EOC.

Identify the location of emergency response and support services including: LE, fire and
emergency services (F&ES), medical, transportation, public works and engineering, munitions
range control, and other relevant support services.

Locate the EOC where congestion will not hinder access and where other contiguous facilities
cannot impair EOC functions.

Locate the EOC where radio and other communication systems can operate most advantageously,
have the most coverage, and are away from radio interference such as power lines and tall metal
structures.

Verify the site has an adequate area for the EOC building, required setbacks, and parking.

Determine the type of available parking (surface versus garage) and if the parking can be secured.

Determine if the site can accommodate helicopter access.

Identify flight paths near the EOC site.

Identify nearby active commercial, private, and military airports.

Ensure the EOC is not exposed to overhanging trees or forest from which wind-blown debris can
strike the EOC.
Note. Debris and dust can damage essential EOC equipment such as antennas; heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning; and generator motor filter systems. 
2-14. The EOC site should be easily and quickly securable in the event of an emergency. This includes the
protection of—

Staff.

Buildings.

Communication systems.

Utility services.

Transportation services.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
2-15. The location within a building is an important factor. The first consideration is given to subgrade
locations where the EOC is protected from blast, windborne debris, windstorms, and other hazards. Special
caution is given when EOC locations are proposed on upper floors of structures since access can be hindered
by nonworking elevators and compromised egress stairs. Upper floors may also be more susceptible to
windstorm damage. Basements or floors built underground may also be more susceptible to flood or damage
from earthquakes.
2-16. Verify the facilities selected for EOC use have ample area to create large operations and
communication rooms and they have the additional area necessary for support spaces. Verify the facility has,
or can accept, the infrastructure to support the protection, cabling, and environmental control necessary in the
EOC. Verify the exterior envelope is at, or can be upgraded to, the necessary EOC protection levels. The EOC
should have the capability to shelter-in-place (SIP) to ensure continuous operations.
2-17. The EOC should not be located in a high-rise building or next to a high-rise building that can collapse.
The following are additional areas of concern—

Possible expansion requirements when locating the EOC.

Compatibility of other functions with the EOC if the proposed facility will be occupied by those
other functions.

Increased security necessary for the EOC during full operations impairs the functions of other
tenants.

Flooding when locating EOCs in basements.
Note. Although designs may be contrived to withstand groundwater pressure during normal 
operating procedures, damage to EOC subgrade structures may allow water (under pressure from 
bomb or earthquake shock, liquefaction, or flooding) to enter into the EOC. 
2-18. Plan an alternative site for the EOC. In addition to the primary EOC, an alternative location is planned
in the event the primary EOC cannot perform its function. The alternative EOC becomes the primary command 
and control (C2) point when the primary EOC is disabled.
2-19. The secondary site is prepared and is capable of immediate activation, and relocation plans for moving
staff and essential items (such as secure documents) to the alternative site are in-place. The alternative site is
selected to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the degree to which the major hazards that impact the
primary EOC will not affect the alternative site. Usually, criteria that applies to the primary EOC will apply
to the alternative EOC. The following are some considerations for selection of a secondary site—

Consider the relationship of the alternative EOC to the base or installation administrative centers
and emergency services.

Consider the accessibility of the site by the emergency operations team (while the alternative EOC
is at a different location to avoid both centers being disabled by the same event, access for staff
from their normal duty posts is an essential concern).

Consider placing the alternative EOC at a site served by roadways other than those that serve the
primary EOC (particular attention is given to access routes that could be blocked by flooding, rail
lines, traffic congestion, or other features that can be circumvented by the alternative site).

Verify the alternative EOC has adequate parking.

Determine how the resident function will be performed during an incident if the alternative EOC
has a dual-use function.

Verify the resident function will be suspended during EOC use of the alternative facility.
Note. The EOC has redundant power and telecommunications. It is fed from two grids and has a 
second telecom network in the building.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
2-20. EM planning is predicated on critical asset, threat/hazard, vulnerability, consequence, and response
capability assessments. These assessments are used to evaluate the ability of an installation to respond to a
threat/hazard, protect the population on the installation, and implement strategies to mitigate risks.
2-21. Risk management is a comprehensive process and a critical planning element of EM that allows for
the estimation of the necessary elements before, and continuous with, the development of the EMP. Appendix
B outlines additional information regarding risk management.
2-22. EM risk management is a continuous process. After the EMP is promulgated, the installation senior
staff members schedule periodic follow-ups to reassess EM preparations. These periodic follow-ups help
ensure necessary resources remain properly deployed, prepared, and synchronized to successfully execute EM
tasks. Reassessments occur at least annually before an update or review of the EMP and concurrently with
changes in threat or unit and resource availability.
2-23. Issues that justify and prioritize hazards/threats used for planning are well documented so the facts
governing these decisions can be reviewed with each risk management process review.
COMMUNITY PROFILE 
2-24. A community profile serves to inform the installation commander on the population and facilities to
be protected. This includes an assessment of demographic information, personnel categorization,
infrastructure, and installation zoning to identify, prioritize, and allocate resources appropriately.

At the military Service level, the community profile involves the identification and prioritization
of installations and facilities, along with associated tenants, to maximize readiness with limited
fiscal resources.

At the headquarters level, a community profile is tailored to identify and prioritize EM activities
based on mission requirements set by the headquarters itself.

At the installation level, a community profile entails a comprehensive examination of the
community’s demographics, infrastructure, requirements, and resources.
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT (VA) 
2-25. The VAs enable commanders to take a holistic look at installation strengths and weaknesses compared
to the OE and identified threats. VAs are conducted annually (before the update or review of the EMP) using
use DOD mission assurance assessment benchmarks. The assessment results determine the basis and
justification for EM program enhancements, program planning, and budget requests. The use of existing VA
methodology and operational risk management principles are essential as inputs into the prevention and
protection phases. Threat and hazard analysis will include such variables as the overall environment, mission,
threat, demographics, required capabilities, and available infrastructure. The impact of each of these variables
can be immense given the potential threats the DOD faces. See See FEMA 452 - Risk Assessment: A How-To
Guide to Mitigate Potential Terrorist Attacks Against Buildings and Unified Facilities Criteria publications

THREAT/HAZARD ASSESSMENT 
2-26. Installations perform threat/hazard assessments in coordination with the assessments performed for
antiterrorism (AT) and the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program. Threat/hazard assessments use the DOD
mission assurance assessment benchmarks, Service guidance, or combatant command guidance to address the
Chapter 2 
2-8

broad range of hazards/threats to the installation and personnel. The assessment identifies hazards/threats and 
the likelihood of them occurring. After the threats/hazards are assessed, efforts are necessary to mitigate their 
potential effects and to prevent them from affecting the installation and its associated mission-essential 
functions. See FEMA Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 201 for additional information. 
CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT 
2-27. Installations conduct capability assessments and consider contingency planning activities. The
objectives of the capability assessment are to—

Consider the range of identified and projected response capabilities necessary for responding to
hazards.

List installation resources by type to provide an asset capability report.

Review policy, guidance, and planning documents to identify the mission-essential tasks and
functions assigned to the organization.

List installation personnel who have mission-essential EM responsibilities.

Identify costs associated with assessment outcomes for future budget planning.
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP) 
2-28. Each EMP is comprehensive, covers all known hazards, and is designed to support preincident
planning for building, sustaining core capabilities and conducting unified operations to deliver them in order
to prevent, protect against, respond to, recover, and mitigate from any threat or hazard. The EMP is flexible
enough for use in all emergencies and is detailed enough to provide a course of action for installation
commanders to apply to an unexpected incident. Appendix C details elements of the EMP.
2-29. The EM planning and development begin with reviews of the OE and the structure of the installation
command and staff. Military planning processes develop these assessments and estimates into the final EMP.
Some Services may use the FEMA CPG 101, Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans, to
structure their planning process.
2-30. EMPs are reviewed at least annually (sooner if conditions warrant) to ensure the integration of changes
in threats, VAs, capabilities, and command relationships with civil authorities. Other appropriate triggers for
EMP review include results of historical location data and after action reports (AAR) from training, exercises,
and actual incidents.
2-31. The installation commander and staff have the primary responsibility for ensuring the development
and maintenance of the EMP. Under the direction of the command, the installation emergency manager and
the EMWG develop, maintain, exercise, execute, and revise the EMP according to the specifications of this
and other instructions and directives, as appropriate.
2-32. EMPs are developed with a clear understanding and identification of the mission-essential functions
of the installation. According to the DOD mission assurance strategy, the first pillar of mission assurance is
the identification and prioritization of mission-essential functions and supporting assets and systems. The
COOP community has defined a mission decomposition architecture that can be used to define these assets.
Installations should review this architecture on a routine basis as part of operational planning.
2-33. The individual elements of the EMP are included in applicable installation-specific EM exercises to
ensure assigned personnel are well prepared in their individual roles. All EMPs are coordinated with tenant,
Federal, state, local, other Service, and/or private (or HN) response/recovery partners. Appendixes B and C
provide details on plan development and maintenance, including the construction of the threat/hazard
vulnerability and risk assessment.
2-34. Installation preparedness includes tracking and disseminating information about the threat
environment. The installation may use different methods to track and disseminate specific threat/hazard
information. These mechanisms are considered for incorporation into the EMP.
2-35. Commanders will ensure plans provide for the continuation of critical, mission-essential services and
consider environmental standards, operational safety concerns, and occupational health protection. Each

installation will develop installation response plans to respond to a myriad of disasters, hazards, and 
contingencies. Installations, including tenant units, will tailor their response plans to the installation’s mission, 
criticality considerations, and threat assessment. The EMP is supported by a myriad of plans and has external 
factors that shape the overall plan. The plan provides comprehensive guidance for responding to an emergency 
incident that may affect an installation or its mission. This plan identifies procedures to be followed in the 
event of major accidents, natural disasters, attack actions, and use of CBRN materials. 
SUPPORT FOR COORDINATING PROGRAMS 
2-36. EM programs coordinate with existing installation protection programs to the extent that their
objectives and responsibilities overlap or complement one another. EM maintains an active dialogue with the
AT, COOP, CIP, Security, Command force protection (FP), and Federal fire programs on the installation to
ensure the coordination of efforts and resources. The plans listed in table 2.2 provide additional EM response
procedures and information.

collective, proactive effort focused on the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks against DOD personnel, 
their families, facilities, installations, and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment and on the 
preparation to defend against, and plan for, the response to the consequences of terrorist incidents AT and EM 
programs coordinate plans for terrorism incident response preparedness and continued essential military 
operations. 
CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS (COOP) 
2-38. The purpose of a COOP program is to provide for the continual operation of installation mission-
essential functions and associated critical mission facilities (CMF) throughout an emergency. A COOP is a
separate process from EM; however, the management of emergencies is interrelated with full COOP planning
efforts and the coordination of EMPs that support COOP plans at installation, local, and regional levels. The
responsibility of the installation is to support such efforts and ensure installation level services required to
execute the COOP plan of the mission-essential function are developed and made available during a
contingency requiring the activation of the COOP plan. It is the responsibility of the commander in charge of
the mission-essential functions to sign the applicable COOP plan, finance the identified requirements, and
coordinate COOP requirements with the installation, specifically through the EMWG.
2-39. A COOP program involves—

Protecting infrastructures deemed critical to force and materiel readiness and operations in peace,
crisis, and war.

Mitigating the loss or disruption of mission-essential functions and planning for timely restoration
or recovery of mission-essential functions through an appropriate devolution of the operations
plan.

Planning for the dependence on other assets (infrastructures, utilities, facilities, private sector
services, other government departments and agencies) to help accomplish the installation mission.

Coordinating with private and nonmilitary asset owners on the security and protection of critical
civilian infrastructures and assets.

Maintaining information sharing, cooperative agreements, and outreach efforts with the private
sector, including partnerships with state and local governments and HNs.
2-40. Based on DODD 3020.26, DOD Continuity Policy, and DODI 3020.42, Defense Continuity Plan
Development, certain mission-essential functions and associated CMFs are capable of remaining uninterrupted
or resuming function during the first 12 hours after the occurrence of an emergency and through the full
resumption of all functions. During an emergency, most of the mission-essential functions may be relocated
to a complementary CMF at another location or at a designated emergency relocation site (ERS). The
capability to perform mission-essential functions at alternate sites is fully operational as soon as possible, but
no later than 12 hours after COOP activation. Detailed information on COOP planning and implementation
can be found in DODI 3020.42.
2-41. The identification and criticality of mission-essential functions are examined by determining the
consequences of their nonperformance. After a function has been deemed mission-essential, it is prioritized in
relation to other mission-essential functions. Consistent with DODI 3020.42, areas for consideration as
mission-essential include, but are not limited to—


2-42. The COOP plan provides preplanned processes, assets, and the CONOPS that the organization is
required to have in-place to manage the response, recovery, and reconstitution of mission-essential functions
after an event. COOP planning involves identifying and documenting mission-essential functions and
supporting CMFs. The COOP plan is built on the results of a thorough VA. The installation and the
accompanying commands of each mission-essential function and supporting CMF develop and maintain a
COOP plan pertaining to their organization. Each of these COOP plans aligns with the other coordinating
COOP plans as appropriate. Mission-essential functions and associated CMFs review their COOP plan
annually and submit changes to the supporting installation emergency manager.
2-43. COOP plans also contain—

Organizational structure, succession to command, and delegation of authority to appropriate staff
data.

Personnel manning requirements and procedures to ensure sufficient, qualified personnel are
available throughout the duration of the emergency.

Logistics plans to sustain operations at the ERS.

Lists of mission-essential documents and equipment to be made available at the alternate site.

A plan for the devolution of operations.

Higher headquarters reporting requirements.

Training requirements for COOP positions critical to maintaining C2 during emergencies,
including personnel designated to staff the ERS.

A security element personnel requirement to protect staff and safeguard classified references and
material.
2-44. An excellent series of templates for COOP and devolution of operations planning can be found at
https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/72598. These templates were constructed for Federal
agencies; however, they can be customized for use at the military installation level.
2-45. FEMA has constructed a continuity assistance tool for non-Federal entities to identify continuity
strengths and areas for improvement. It can be easily tailored to fit the needs of an installation evaluating its
own continuity readiness. The tool can be found at https://www.fema.gov/continuity-resource-toolkit.
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION (CIP) 
2-46. The CIP program identifies, assesses, and enhances the security of physical and cyberspace assets and
associated infrastructures essential to the execution of the National Military Strategy. Military operations are
heavily dependent on shared critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR). This interconnectivity better
enables mission accomplishment; however, it also increases vulnerability to human error, natural hazards, and
physical or cyberspace attacks. Therefore, it is imperative to identify, protect, and ensure the continuity of
mission-critical infrastructures. As with COOP, CIP is a separate process from EM, yet the management of
emergencies is interrelated with, and highly dependent on, full CIP planning efforts and coordination of EM
plans with CIP plans at installation, local, and regional levels.
2-47. Consistent with the DHS CIKR Center documents (available at https://www.dhs.gov/topic/critical-
infrastructure-security) critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or
virtual, whose damage or destruction would weaken national defense or economic security, as in the
elimination of critical services or capabilities to an identified mission-essential function or associated CMF.
Key resources include publicly and privately controlled resources essential to the operations listed above.
2-48. Consistent with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the CIP program involves—

Identifying critical resources, assets, systems, and networks.

Identifying internal and external vulnerabilities to those resources and assessing their risks.

Recognizing the relationship between vulnerabilities and operational readiness.

Prioritizing assets in relation to their operational criticality and risk level.

Mitigating/managing the vulnerabilities and employing resiliency strategies, if possible.

Measuring the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 

Planning for contingencies, including dependence on others assets (infrastructures, utilities,
facilities, services of the private sector, other government departments and agencies) to help
accomplish the installation mission.
2-49. A risk management-based CIP plan is developed and maintained. The plan aligns with other
coordinating CIP plans, including neighboring civilian agency plans, as appropriate. When requested, host
installation and tenant commands develop and submit local plans for CIP remediation and mitigation, CIP
discussion and operational exercises, and local CIP best practices. Each installation evaluates existing support
agreements (including memorandum of understanding [MOU], memorandum of agreement [MOA], mutual
aid agreements [MAA], and inter-Service support agreement [ISSA]) as the basis for integrating their CIP
tasks. The evaluation of support agreements identifies installation risks and vulnerabilities that are created by
a reliance on other Service, government, or civil sector infrastructures and key resources. The evaluation also
identifies tools to reduce risks and vulnerabilities or to ensure the protection of those assets and mitigate their
associated risks.
2-50. On an installation level, CIP is not usually within the purview of the installation command or the EM
staff. The owners or operators of the utilities or services are usually responsible for this function. As on the
Federal level, building partnerships with controlling agencies increases the likelihood infrastructure and
resources are available to the installation during an emergency.
2-51. Each installation emergency manager maintains information sharing, cooperative agreements, and
outreach efforts with the private sector to identify collaborative avenues in the protection of infrastructure that
is vital to the installation and its mission.
2-52. DODI O-2000.16, Volumes 1 and 2, delineates the needed installation and higher headquarters review
and reporting for CIP from an AT perspective. For more information on CIP, see DODD 3020.40, Mission
Assurance (MA), and DODI 3020.45, Mission Assurance (MA) Construct, and review the FEMA EM Institute
Independent Study (IS) courses available online at https://training.fema.gov/is/ (IS-860.a, The National
Infrastructure Protection Plan, and IS-821, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Support Annex).
CIVILIAN COORDINATION AND INTEROPERABILITY 
2-53. A major objective of preparedness efforts is to ensure mission integration and interoperability in
response to emergent crises across functional and organizational lines and between public and private
organizations. This integration effort includes interagency coordination, coordination with tenant and transient
units on the installation, and the interoperability of procedures and resources with civilian counterparts.
2-54. MAAs. A MAA consists of a prearranged, nonbinding agreement between two or more entities, public
and/or private, to render human and/or materiel resources or services when resources of one party are not
adequate to meet the needs of an emergency. The installation commander will develop resource management
objectives and processes that address resources and partnership arrangements essential to the EM Program.
All concerned parties must maintain a copy of the MAA for its applicable duration.
2-55. Support agreements. Installation commanders shall develop support agreements with civil first and
emergency responders, including local EM agencies, where applicable. These support agreements include
MAAs or other support agreements written as an MOA, an MOU, an ISSA, or support contract. Support
agreements should outline cooperative measures where personnel may assist the civilian community and vice
versa in response to and recovery from the impact of natural, technological, and terrorism hazards. All support
agreements must be reviewed annually. See Appendix G for more information on support agreements.
2-56. Support contracts. Support contracts shall be utilized for the procurement of goods, services, or other
emergency support, to include the contingency procurement of food and water supplies for safe havens.
COORDINATION 
2-57. Responding to an incident on an installation may require all existing installation first and emergency
responder assets. If installation organic response capabilities are exceeded or do not exist for a particular
hazard or threat, installation commanders may require assistance from nearby Federal, state, local, other
Service, and/or private (or HN) capabilities to effectively respond to, and recover from, an incident. Close

liaison with these agencies and departments in advance is essential to ensure adequate resources are available 
when required. 
2-58. Each installation ensures EMPs of various components and tenants within the installation have been
thoroughly coordinated with each other; with the response plans of local, state, and Federal organizations; and
with the plans of joint task forces, multinational forces, or HN forces and organizations. Coordination is
necessary to identify and update responsible points of contact, emergency protocols, and expectations in the
event of an incident on (or of an incident that impacts) a DOD installation consistent with DODI O-2000.16,
Volumes 1 and 2, DODI 6055.06, DOD Fire and Emergency Services Certification Program (F&ESCP), and
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600, Standard on Continuity, Emergency, and Crisis
Management. Coordination also helps ensure the sharing of information pertaining to locally available
technologies and capabilities that may provide early warning of a potential threat or hazard (such as
biomonitoring, chemical or radiological detection, intrusion detection, and decision support tools).
2-59. Installation commanders may develop or provide input to support agreements with local emergency
services, including local EM agencies. These support agreements include MAAs or other support agreements
written as MOAs, MOUs, ISSAs, Status-of-Forces Agreement, or support contracts. Installation legal counsel
personnel assist in the preparation of the agreements and perform a legal review of them before execution.
The support agreements are reviewed and exercised at least annually, and the contents of each support
agreement are seamlessly integrated into the EMP.
2-60. MAAs enable installations and local, state, and Federal organizations to provide resources, facilities,
services, and other required support to one another during a life-threatening or significant property threatening
incident. Preestablished MAAs with private organizations are necessary to facilitate the timely delivery of
assistance at the appropriate organizational level during incidents. MAAs include, at a minimum, the following 
elements or provisions—

Definitions of key terms used in the agreement.

Roles and responsibilities of individual parties.

Procedures for requesting and providing assistance.

Procedures, authorities, and rules for payment, reimbursement, and allocation of costs.

Notification procedures.

Protocols for interoperable communications.

Relationships with other agreements among organizations.

Procedures for workers’ compensation.

Immunity and liability rules and treatment.

Recognition of qualifications and certifications.

Sharing agreements, as required.

Periods for review.

Cancellation procedures.
2-61. Maintaining effective coordination and liaison between installation, tenant, and transient units is the
responsibility of all those concerned. Preferably, before their first arrival at an installation, the EM
representative of the transient unit will initiate specific coordination measures and information exchanges with 
the installation command regarding operational, intelligence, or logistic needs the transient unit may require,
or be able to provide to the installation.
2-62. Adequate preparation and coordination is essential to the success of the liaison and coordination
activities from the installation and a tenant, transient unit, or annex. Coordination is an integral part of the
planning process, and it is important the tenant and transient units maintain a full understanding of the
installation commander’s emergency response plan.
2-63. Each medical treatment facility (MTF) or equivalent ensures that force health protection measures and
public health EM are integrated into existing DOD installation and/or military command emergency
preparedness and response plans and agreements. Each installation coordinates with the nearest MTF
command to ensure parallel efforts and synchronized expectations for preparedness and response between the
Chapter 2 
2-14

28 July 2021 
installation and MTF. Medical and public health response plans for the installation and MTF interface with 
corresponding local, state, Federal, or HN agency EM activities. 
INTEROPERABILITY 
2-64. Interoperability is required across installation partners and stakeholders, as well as with civilian and
nonmilitary agencies. Staffing and communication are key enablers of interoperability. EM programs are
interoperable with EM efforts in their civilian mutual aid community or HN to ensure an effective and efficient
emergency response. Interoperability includes the technical exchange of information, EM systems, processes,
procedures, organizations, and missions and is balanced with information assurance.
2-65. The interoperability requirements of equipment, communication systems, and other EM capabilities
are identified and improved through interagency collaboration, coordination, and participation in all aspects
of EM. Interoperability efforts can also be improved through the mutual inclusion of civilian agencies in
installation exercises and training and through the participation of key installation personnel in local
community exercises.
2-66. National Level. The FEMA, through the DHS, is responsible for sustaining and improving our
capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. The DOD provides 
support to the FEMA and DHS during emergency situations. Per HSPD-5, the Secretary of Homeland Security 
is ultimately responsible for the NRF. Installations should reference the NPFs and DOD and Service policies
and regulations when devising local plans and procedures to ensure consonance with national policy. The Joint 
Director of Military Support is a designated general/flag grade position in the Operations Directorate of the
Joint Staff. The Joint Director of Military Support is responsible for processing requests for DOD assistance
and preparing (developing and coordinating) an execution order, if required.
2-67. Regional Level. The combatant commanders are designated the supported combatant commanders for
the DOD response to an incident that occurs within their respective areas of responsibility. The operations
center designated by the combatant commander is the DOD’s regional coordination center. The supported
combatant commander is responsible for executing the DOD response mission and exercises operational
control over military forces responding to the incident, as specified by the Secretary of Defense. To ensure a
successful response, an installation official will establish a partnership with neighboring State, local, tribal,
and territory officials and responders.
INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PREPAREDNESS AND COMMUNITY 
AWARENESS 
2-68. Individual and community preparedness is a time and resource multiplier for the emergency response
effort. Help may not always arrive when expected; therefore, an installation can implement individual and
family preparedness efforts to ensure personnel, their families, and other community members to include
private companies, are prepared to immediately respond to emergencies on their own until help becomes
available. A well-informed community will prevent an unnecessary delay of response efforts, and their
resilience will enable activated responders to concentrate on mitigating the hazard and initiating recovery
operations.
INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PREPAREDNESS 
2-69. The responsibility for proper emergency preparedness extends to the family and individual level. The
proper preparedness of the individual and the family is essential to the overall success of an EM program,
especially due to the reliance on evacuation, movement to safe haven, movement to shelter, lockdown, and
SIP as the primary protective strategies for many families and individuals associated with the installation
community. Installation personnel should develop a personal or family emergency plan (including a plan for
pets) and to develop and maintain a personal or family emergency kit.
2-70. Military families and individuals (especially those stationed abroad) have unique emergency readiness
considerations that distinguish them from the general population. Families and individuals associated with an
installation have likely often moved to new locations and may not have a strong understanding of possible
evacuation routes or locations of emergency supply stores if they are new to the area. They also may not speak

28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
2-15
the native language of their HN. In addition, while much of the general population relies on other family 
members in their area during an emergency, members of the military community are less likely to live near 
extended family. On the positive side, because installation community members are accustomed to relocating 
often, they are uniquely prepared for certain aspects of emergency readiness, such as the collection and 
recording of important personal and financial records before an evacuation. 
2-71. Detailed preparedness guidance, especially regarding planning and family or individual preparedness
kits, is available at the FEMA Ready Campaign website http://www.ready.gov. This site also has a section
dedicated to the unique considerations of military family preparedness that links to Service-specific public
awareness programs.
COMMUNITY AWARENESS 
2-72. Successful response operations begin with building a resilient military community that is actively
engaged in installation preparedness efforts. Installation personnel may recognize the hazard first and notify
the installation dispatch center by dialing 9-1-1 or another local emergency number. Installation personnel
may also be inclined to actively engage in response efforts, including organizing evacuation and sheltering
plans, performing initial treatment of the wounded, and gathering and providing information to first
responders.
2-73. Achieving a resilient community requires a targeted public awareness program and quality outreach
products. Service-specific programs (such as Ready Army, Air Force Be Ready, Ready Marine Corps and the
Navy’s Operation Prepare) are proactive programs that increase the survivability and resilience of military
community members by informing them about relevant hazards, appropriate response procedures, and
contamination avoidance measures and by encouraging them to have an emergency plan and kit.
2-74. It is imperative the community be engaged early and often in the planning and preparation process of
the EM program. Key partners in the installation effort to build a resilient community may include Fleet and
Family Readiness (USN); the public affairs office; morale, welfare and recreation; housing and welcome
centers; and others. Community awareness programs are regularly scheduled events that can occur at in-
processing or during annual training and are recurring throughout the year via various venues, such as the post
newspaper or family assistance web sites.
2-75. Before an event, the community can be involved in a dialogue with the installation and its key partners
to provide outreach materials tailored to address local emergency threats. This awareness program can also
target specific audiences (families with children or pets, special-needs individuals, unmarried people) and
convey the following information—

Where to get information before, during, and after an emergency.

What actions are required of them in the event of an incident on or near the installation.

How to prepare individual and family preparedness plans and why they are important.

How to prepare emergency kits for themselves, their families, and their animals.

What services to expect from the installation before, during, and after an incident.
TRAINING, EXERCISES, AND EVALUATION 
2-76. EM organizations and personnel at all levels have opportunities for individual, collective, and
collaborative training and exercises to effectively provide the installation with an all-hazards incident
management capability. The value of these training and exercise programs is continually and consistently
evaluated internally and externally to ensure relevance and validity for EM capability development.
TRAINING 
2-77. EM programs establish minimum training standards for the effective management of all-hazards
emergencies. Installations train to perform individual and collective EM tasks as units and joint forces.
Licensing and certification standards vary based on geographical locations and available equipment on the
installation. Commanders ensure operators are fully trained to complete their assigned missions. Training is
provided to HN military and civilian work forces and U.S. contractors on the installation.
Chapter 2 
2-16
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
2-78. To ensure an effective response, an installation-wide and cross-functional training program is
implemented. Thorough training is required to prepare individuals and emergency teams to safely and
efficiently respond to an incident at their required level of proficiency.
2-79. The implementation of a strong EM training program creates awareness across the installation and
enhances the skills of individuals with assigned EM functions or responsibilities. The active use of such readily 
available training and educational materials also helps ensure an appropriate level of competency of
installation commanders, responders, technicians, specialists, and the base population.
2-80. The lead functional area for each mission-essential task tracks and reports the training provided to
personnel. Reporting is consistent with DODD 7730.65, Department of Defense Readiness Reporting System
(DRRS), and may be augmented by DOD component-specific policies and procedures.
2-81. Numerous courses and training opportunities are available from various government and private
sources. The installation emergency manager can tailor program training needs to meet specific mission
requirements. Training requirements for general all-hazards awareness, EM personnel, commanders, first
responders, first receivers, emergency responders, and the base population at all levels of the management
structure can be found in DODI 6055.17.
EXERCISES 
2-82. Education and training are not enough to prepare an installation for an incident. The use of realistic
exercises ensures the installation is prepared for, and can efficiently conduct operations under, emergency
conditions. Exercises are conducted at regular periodicity as directed.
2-83. Conduct exercises according to DODI 6055.17 and IAW the Homeland Security Exercise and
Evaluation Program (HSEEP). Examples of guidance and information found in this reference include—

A capability gap analysis.

A response capability assessment.

Frequency and functional requirements for exercise design and execution.

An exercise evaluation.

Corrective-action mechanisms.
2-84. Exercises include participants from all emergency response functions on the installation and, when
possible, from appropriate tenants and local, state, Federal, and HN participants using existing support
agreements to ensure the proper integration into the EMP. Each exercise includes realistic scenarios the
installation could face based on the current risk assessment/all-hazard threat assessment. Each exercise is
designed to evaluate specific critical missions or tasks within the overall training scenario.
2-85. When appropriate, installations located outside the U.S. align their installation exercise and training
schedules with those of the combatant commander, the HN, and the Department of State. Installations located
within the U.S. consider aligning their installation exercise and training schedules with those of the
Department of Justice, the DHS, and state and local preparedness programs, as appropriate. Such synchronized 
training and exercise opportunities will further foster well-synchronized responses to EM incidents.
2-86. Each exercise provides realistic scenario elements and injects designed to validate installation
capabilities and capacities to meet the needs of their protected populaces while sustaining mission readiness.
Unexpected challenges (such as disabling key personnel and equipment) are included to assess the resiliency
of the response process (see TC 7-101, Exercise Design).
2-87. Tabletop exercises can be used to provide installation leadership and staff with opportunities to war-
game multiple scenarios. Tabletop training exercises are specifically designed to train leaders to execute
critical missions and critical collective tasks.
2-88. Ensure all members of the installation exercise evaluation team are familiar with the HSEEP. HSEEP
is a capability and performance-based exercise program that provides a standardized methodology and
terminology for exercise design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning. Information
on HSEEP courses is available online at https://www.fema.gov/hseep.

EVALUATION 
2-89. A critical weakness in training and exercises is the failure to evaluate capabilities and tasks needed to
meet the needs of the installation populace while sustaining mission readiness against well-defined risk-
informed targets. Every training opportunity or exercise provides the potential for evaluation feedback. Each
evaluation is a training session. Trainers and leaders continually evaluate training and exercises as they are
executed to ensure an optimized training and exercise program.
2-90. Evaluations can be internal or external—

Internal evaluations are conducted at all levels and are implemented into all training and exercises.
Installation exercise evaluation teams are established to conduct these internal evaluations.

External evaluations are administered at the discretion of the chain of command to evaluate its
ability to perform critical response missions.
Note. See FM 7-0, Train to Win in a Complex World, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-2501, 
Emergency Management Program, for additional information on after action reviews. 
SUMMARY 
2-91. Prevention and protection consists of the activities, tasks, programs, and systems developed and
implemented before an emergency that are used to support the mitigation of, response to, and recovery from
emergencies. These activities can include developing plans and SOPs; assessing and managing risk by
conducting hazard assessments and VAs; coordinating functional responsibilities throughout the installation
enterprise; and implementing training, exercise, and evaluation procedures.

Respond 
Response operations consist of the actions taken from the initial notification of a 
potential or actual incident through the recovery phase. Each installation response 
occurs under different circumstances, but follows the common framework and incident 
command structure under NIMS and the NRF, regardless of the type of incident. An 
installation response depends on whether the installation is in a peacetime or 
contingency environment, what organic resources are available, what resources must 
be obtained from off the installation, and what threats currently face the installation. 
ACTIONS 
3-1. 
The key components of response include C2, support activity integration, communication, and resource 
management. Figure 3-1 provides an overview of response actions that are integral to typical emergency
responses. Each of these areas is discussed in further detail throughout this document.
Figure 3-1. Respond 
COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

C2 of the response phase follows the NRF/NIMS framework for the establishment and execution of
command functions during a response. Key command elements in a response are discussed in the following

INITIAL RESPONSE ACTIONS 
3-3. 
The initial response phase includes—

An initial observation and report by the person who discovered the incident.

The establishment of C2 and communications with first responder network.

Mass, internal, and external notifications.

Immediate and continuous health and safety protection actions.

Immediate and continuous evaluations of the safety of possible responses.

Immediate steps to control the source of the hazard, when applicable.

The activation of local response resources.

A constant assessment of the situation and maintenance of SA.
3-4. 
The initial IC usually manages the response by using a series of informal meetings and conversations
to gather information from the initial response team and provide response guidance.
3-5. 
Depending on the size or impact of the incident, demands on the IC can increase quickly and additional
personnel can be assigned to support critical functions. These initial assignments form the core of a response
management organization, performing crucial ICS functions even before a formal ICS process is initiated. If
the initial IC determines an expanded ICS organization will be needed to manage the response, an incident
briefing will end the initial response phase.
INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM (ICS) 
3-6. 
The ICS is a standardized, on-scene, all-hazards incident management approach that—

Allows for the integration of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications
operating within a common organizational structure.

Enables a coordinated response among various jurisdictions and functional agencies, both public
and private.

Establishes common processes for planning and managing resources.
Note. For details on the ICS TTP, see Appendix D. 
3-7. 
The ICS is used throughout the U.S. and is the recognized standard for on-scene incident management.
The ICS is specifically designed to allow response agencies to adopt an integrated, organizational structure
equal to the complexity and demand of single or multiple incidents without being hindered by jurisdictional
boundaries.
3-8. 
DOD installations use procedures consistent with ICS principles for the management of emergencies
covered by the DOD EM program. Agencies use the system on a day-to-day basis for routine situations and
for major emergencies.
3-9. 
There are two functional centers on the installation during an incident response. They are the incident
command post (ICP) and the EOC—

ICP. The ICP is responsible for on-scene response activities and is under the direction of the IC.
The IC/UC reports to the EOC Director who then reports to the installation commander.

EOC. The EOC is responsible for the entire installation-wide response to the event and provides
overall C2 (on behalf of the installation commander) of the incident.
Note. USAF organizations employ a third C2 node. This C2 node includes the installation 
commander and key staff and is called the CAT, which operates out of the installation’s command 
post (CP). This C2 node links ongoing incident response actions with the execution of the 
installation mission operations and maintains linkage with higher headquarters.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
3-3
3-10. When an incident occurs, trained installation personnel initiate the ICS and establish an ICP for on-
site response. The ICP is a location or facility of the tactical-level, on scene where IC/UC, command and
general staff personnel are located at. The ICP is typically located in the immediate vicinity of the incident
site.
3-11. Initial safety zones for the establishment of an ICP during HAZMAT events are defined in the most
recent version of the Department of Transportation Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG). The ERG table
of initial isolation and protective action distances provides first responders with initial guidance until
technically qualified emergency response personnel are available. Distances from the area of impact show
areas likely to be affected during the first 30 minutes after materials are spilled. The size of these areas could
increase or decrease with time.
3-12. The senior installation first responder on the scene of an incident who has the requisite training
implements the ICS. The responder assumes the role of the IC and is responsible for directing and controlling
resources by virtue of explicit legal, agency, or delegated authority. As the installation response further
progresses, the role of the IC may change hands as more qualified first responders arrive on-scene or are
appointed by the installation commander after a briefing is conducted. At some point, a UC or area command
may be established depending on the magnitude of the event or an incident of national significance.
3-13. The IC is responsible for all aspects of the response, including developing incident objectives and
managing incident operations. The IC sets priorities and defines the ICS organization for the particular
response. Even if other positions are not assigned, the IC is designated. The IC may assign deputies, who must
have the same qualifications as the person for whom they work, as they must be ready to take over the IC
position at any time.
Note. The IC is solely the tactical commander of the incident and is in charge of running the 
response and initial recovery for the incident. The command of the installation remains with the 
installation commander throughout the incident, and the installation commander is ultimately 
responsible for all efforts on the installation. 
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER (EOC) 
3-14. EOCs have SOPs for monitoring incident development. They provide the following functions—

Common operational picture (COP). The EOC uses a COP and incident management system to
execute and support actions required by the EMP and to facilitate the coordination of incident
information.

Interoperable communications. The EOC ensures interoperable communications support the first
responder and first receiver missions of the Service component and are encouraged to ensure
interoperable communications with civil authorities.

Mass warning and notification. DOD installations maintain mass warning and notification
capabilities to warn personnel immediately, but no longer than 10 minutes after incident
notification and verification.

Continuous warning point. The DOD component heads ensure a continuous contact or warning
point capability for emergencies.
3-15. The EOC functions as an ICS liaison who coordinates support for the IC/ICP in all functional areas
and follow-on elements. The EOC controls functional-area response and installation support elements so
taskings or requests from the incident site are supported, and it keeps higher headquarters informed. Each
installation EOC is NIMS-compliant while using the incident or UC system organizational structure to provide 
a collaboration point and operations center for installation staff. The EOC supports the execution of the EMP,
operational/contingency plans of assigned unit commanders, and the NRF.
3-16. Just as every incident will not require the activation of the EOC, not every EOC activation will invoke
the full range of EOC capabilities. EOC activation levels (steady state, partial or full) can be scaled based on
the scope of the incident and the extent to which the EOC was already activated at the time of the incident (for
Chapter 3

28 July 2021 
example, if the EOC is already in a steady state of activation due to an exercise at the time of the incident). 
For more details on the TTP of the EOC, see Appendix D. 
MULTIAGENCY COORDINATION SYSTEM (MACS) 
3-17. As defined in NIMS, the MACS is a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and
communications integrated into a common system with responsibility for coordinating and supporting
domestic-incident management activities. The MACS is focused on strategic and operational tasks at the
installation level and supporting the IC. The primary MACS functions are to support incident management
policies and priorities; facilitate logistics support and resource tracking; inform resource allocation decisions
using incident management priorities; manage incident-related information; and coordinate interagency and
intergovernmental issues regarding incident management policies, priorities, and strategies. The MACS
provides central locations for operational information sharing and resource coordination in support of on-
scene efforts. Direct tactical and operational responsibility for conducting incident management activities at
the tactical level remains with the IC.
DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES (DSCA) 
3-18. All DOD directives should be consulted before support is provided to civilian authorities. Usually, the
response to an emergency in the local community is the responsibility of local and state governments. Military 
response occurs—

At the direction of the Governor of the affected state for National Guard forces.

Upon declaration by the President as requested by the Governor of the affected state.

At the direction of Service secretaries for capabilities not assigned to geographic combatant
commanders (bases, installations).

Through immediate response authority.
3-19. Consistent with DODI 3020.52, DOD Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE) Preparedness Standards, and DODD 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil
Authorities (DSCA), the DOD, because of its capabilities and resources, may be requested through established
channels to provide temporary, short-duration emergency support to civil authorities during an emergency
when local and state resources have been overwhelmed and request for assistance have been submitted by
civilian authorities via the procedures detailed in the NRF.
3-20. Consistent with DODD 3025.18, Federal military commanders, heads of DOD components, and
responsible DOD civilian officials (referred to collectively as DOD officials) have immediate response
authority. “A Federal military commander’s, DOD Component Head’s, and/or responsible DOD civilian
official’s authority temporarily to employ resources under their control, subject to any supplemental direction
provided by higher headquarters, and provide those resources to save lives, prevent human suffering, or
mitigate great property damage in response to a request for assistance from a civil authority, under imminently
serious conditions when time does not permit approval from a higher authority within the U.S. Immediate
response authority does not permit actions that would subject civilians to the use of military power that is
regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory.”
3-21. There are several statutory authorities DOD may use to provide support and be reimbursed. These are
detailed in JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities. Additional statutes are discussed below—

Homeland Security Act (Section 101, Title 6, United States Code [USC]). The Homeland Security
Act was amended with respect to the organization and mission of the FEMA in the DHS
Appropriations Act and established DHS as an executive department of the U.S. The Homeland
Security Act consolidated component agencies, including FEMA, into the DHS. The Secretary of
Homeland Security is the head of DHS and has direction, authority, and control over it. All
functions of all officers, employees, and organizational units of DHS are vested in the Secretary.

Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Section 5121, Title 42, USC).
The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It describes the programs
and processes by which the Federal government provides disaster and emergency assistance to
state and local governments, tribal nations, eligible private nonprofit organizations, and

28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
3-5
individuals affected by a declared major disaster or emergency. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act covers all hazards, including natural disasters and terrorist 
events. 

Posse Comitatus Act (Section 1385, Title 18, USC). The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits Federal,
state, and local authorities from using Title 10, USC forces for any direct civil LE activities unless
a constitutional or act of Congress exception applies. The Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit
Federal forces from assisting state and local organizations with humanitarian disaster relief.
3-22. Overseas installations coordinate their efforts with the supported geographic combatant command and,
consistent with geographic combatant command guidance and DODI 5530.03, International Agreements, with
appropriate Department of State officials and HNs. DSCA does not apply to support in response to foreign
disasters. Refer to DODD 5100.46, Foreign Disaster Relief (FDR), and JP 3-29, Foreign Humanitarian
Assistance. All international agreements comply with the procedures and regulations outlined in DODI
5530.03.
3-23. DOD units supporting an emergency response will be under the C2 of defense authorities, yet they
may work in support of the civil authorities assisting the installation. The legal considerations for emergency
response on an installation are complex and vary by the location, affected area, and incident type. Commanders 
consult their legal staff at the beginning of the planning process to incorporate, understand, and train staffs
and responders on the limitations a particular installation might face.
INTEGRATION OF SUPPORT ACTIVITIES 
3-24. ESFs organize and provide structure to Federal interagency emergency response activities.
Installations apply the ESF structure or equivalent functional area structure to emergency planning.
Installations have the latitude to choose an organizational structure other than ESFs to provide functional area
support to the emergency response effort. Details on the ESFs are provided in the NRF and Appendix C.
Appendix C also contains guidance for using functional areas in lieu of the ESF structure.
3-25. The following ESFs are outlined in the NRF—

ESF 1—Transportation.

ESF 2—Communications.

ESF 3—Public Works and Engineering.

ESF 4—Firefighting.

ESF 5—Information and Planning.

ESF 6—Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Temporary Housing, and Human Services.

ESF 7—Logistics Management and Resource Support.

ESF 8—Public Health and Medical Services.

ESF 9—Search and Rescue.

ESF 10—Oil and HAZMAT Response.

ESF 11—Agriculture and Natural Resources.

ESF 12—Energy.

ESF 13—Public Safety and Security.

ESF 14—Cross-Sector Business and Infrastructure.

ESF 15—External Affairs.
3-26. The support functions of communications and resource management are integral to the operation of
the EOC and are major, overarching components of NIMS. They are discussed in more detail in the following
sections and in Appendixes E and F, respectively. Appendix G contains a sample MAA support agreement,
while Appendix H contains TTP on the support function for evacuation, SIP, and lockdown. Appendix I
contains TTP for the mass care support function.
3-27. The installation commander has the authority to respond to incidents that are around or may affect the
installation within the first 72 hours without receiving approval from the Secretary of Defense or respective
Chapter 3 
3-6
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
Service Chief of Staff. This is called immediate response authority and may be extended past 72 hours while 
official requests for DOD assistance are processed through the MAA process. 
COMMUNICATIONS 
3-28. Communication needs during a response span from communicating with and among responders to
communicating emergency information to the installation community. The following elements of
communication (emergency public information, common operational picture, incident reporting, mass
warning and notification, and dispatch/emergency control/emergency communications) are critical to ensuring
timely, widespread, accurate information delivery throughout the response effort.
EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION (EPI) 
3-29. The construction and delivery of EPI throughout an incident is critical in creating and maintaining a
resilient, trusting, empowered, and cooperative installation community. The delivery of key EPI messages
begins immediately after an incident occurs (as vetted through the public affairs officer in the EOC, through
the joint information center, or at higher headquarters) and continues throughout response and recovery.
3-30. EPI is an ongoing process throughout all mission areas of EM and is designed to engage and inform
personnel potentially affected by an emergency. EPI is typically implemented through the use of the joint
information center.
3-31. In coordination with local civil jurisdictions, installation commanders preselect at least one primary
and one alternate site near the installation for the establishment of a joint information center. The preferable
site for a joint information center, in order to support joint and interagency staffing with Federal, state, local,
and other authorities, is outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the installation. Locating the joint information
center outside installation boundaries is necessary to preserve the adequate exchange of public information
when and if the installation is closed to the public during an emergency.
3-32. The requirement for EPI does not end immediately after termination of the response phase of an
incident. There is a continued need to exchange information with the full range of affected public during the
recovery phase. Installations continue communication during recovery operations by providing pertinent
information, such as conveying the impact and analyses of the incident. Additionally, installations provide
opportunities for stakeholders to submit information on community impacts, lessons learned, and other
relevant information from the community, supporting local, state, and Federal agencies; the media; and
members of the general public.
3-33. Providing pertinent information and assistance to military members, contractors, civilian employees,
and their families is extremely important. Personnel will be better able to concentrate on mission response if
they are confident their family needs (such as medical, housing, legal, counseling, animal care, food, and
clothing) are being met. The primary method of providing this assistance is to activate an emergency family
assistance control center or similar assistance center. This serves as the focal point for family assistance
services and operates in conjunction with the installation EOC and appropriate ESFs and functional areas.
3-34. Using current guidelines, the installation can leverage social media to convey information and monitor
message response. Appendix E provides additional information regarding all aspects of communications TTP,
including EPI.
COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE (COP) 
3-35. According to JP 3-0, Joint Operations, the COP is a single identical display of relevant information
shared by more than one command or jurisdiction that facilitates collaborative planning and assists all echelons 
to achieve SA. A COP is the focal point within an EOC, comprised of the necessary maps, overlays, charts,
status boards, communications equipment and such. During the response phase, commanders and their staffs
use a COP to obtain a quick, timely, usable, precise, and reliable view of the status of an incident. The COP
provides consistency at all levels of incident management across jurisdictions, as well as between various
governmental jurisdictions and private-sector and nongovernmental entities.
Respond 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
3-7
3-36. The COP is capable of supporting all aspects of response operations (hazard locations, evacuation or
SIP requirements and locations, unit response capabilities, unit exposure status, updated risk assessments) to
the greatest extent possible. To be effective, the COP is constantly updated.
3-37. A key benefit of a good COP system is it allows the installation to quickly relay to its tenant and
transient units the identical, graphic display of relevant information for SA. The same information can be
relayed to local officials. In the case of foreign operations, it is feasible that U.S. embassy personnel could
relay these details to HN representatives as appropriate. Thus, a good COP facilitates collaborative planning
throughout the response effort.
INCIDENT REPORTING 
3-38. Incident reporting and documentation procedures are standardized to ensure SA is maintained and EM
and response personnel have easy access to critical information. Detailed instructions for operational and
situation reports can be found in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3150.05D, Joint
Reporting System Situation Monitoring Manual.
3-39. Situation reports offer a snapshot of the past operational period and contain confirmed or verified
information regarding the explicit details (who, what, when, where, how) relating to the incident. Status
reports, which may be contained in situation reports, relay information specifically related to the status of
resources (such as the availability or assignment of resources).
3-40. The information contained in incident notification, situation, and status reports is standardized to
facilitate processing without preventing the collection or dissemination of information unique to a reporting
organization. The transmission of data in a common format enables the passing of pertinent information to
appropriate jurisdictions and organizations and to a national system that can handle data queries and
information and intelligence assessments and analysis.
MASS WARNING AND NOTIFICATION 
3-41. Installations must develop mass warning and notification capabilities to warn personnel immediately,
but no longer than 10 minutes after incident notification and verification. The mass warning and notification
gives response direction using intelligible voice communications, visible signals, texts, text messaging,
computer notification, and tactile or other communication methods. The mass warning TTP is outlined in
Appendix E.
3-42. Based on the report of the DOD Independent Review (Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood)
and the resulting Secretary of Defense memo (Final Recommendations of the Fort Hood Follow-on Review),
DODI 6055.17 requires mass notification and warning systems to be a required capability for installations.
Systems shall be tested at a minimum twice a year to validate efficacy of the notification system. Existing and
future elements may include—

A giant voice for outdoor areas.

In-building speaker systems.

Telephone alert systems for phone calls and text alerts.
Software alert systems for computer and e-mail alerts.
DISPATCH/EMERGENCY CONTROL/EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS 
3-43. The installation dispatch or emergency communications center provides emergency call taking; alarm
monitoring; sensor monitoring; video monitoring and control; communications support; channel, frequency
assignments, and allocation; and emergency notification to response personnel. In some cases, these services
are provided regionally or in collaboration with civil authorities.
3-44. DODI 6055.17 requires a capability for enhanced 9-1-1 service on the installation. Enhanced 9-1-1 is
a telephone system consisting of network, database, and enhanced 9-1-1 equipment that uses the single three-
digit number for reporting police, fire, medical, or other emergency situations to a central location, while
automatically associating a physical address with the telephone number of the calling party.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
3-45. The 9-1-1 systems are interoperable with civilian authorities to allow incoming and outgoing transfers
of voice and location data. Dispatch centers include capabilities for interoperable communication, weather
monitoring, mass warning system control, and COP system access. Dispatch centers may also include
capabilities for the provision of emergency medical dispatch instructions and monitoring of the National
Warning System.
3-46. The EM program coordinates plans with the responsible office for the dispatch function to ensure that
emergency notifications to responders are communicated in a timely manner. The dispatch center is included
in EM exercises and training events as appropriate.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
3-47. Resource management occurs at all levels in support of incident management. Installation resources
supply assets for installation level response efforts and potentially provide support for incident support base
and joint reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (JRSOI) missions. Support agreements are in-
place in advance of an event and are enacted during an event as needed to maintain supplies.
SUPPLY AND LOGISTICS 
3-48. Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date picture of resource availability and utilization is a critical
component of resource management. Resource management includes processes for categorizing, ordering,
dispatching, tracking, and recovering resources. Resource management also includes processes for the
reimbursement of resources, as appropriate.
3-49. As outlined in NIMS, incident management personnel use various resource inventory systems to assess
the availability of assets provided by public, private, and volunteer organizations. Installation emergency
managers are responsible for the consolidation of resource inventory entries and submissions by assigned
ESFs or functional areas. ESFs or functional areas on installations are responsible for entering the resources
available for deployment into the resource inventory maintained at the installation. This resource data is made
available to the supporting installation dispatch center and installation EOC. ESFs or functional areas are also
responsible for resource and financial management related to life cycle management of assigned resources.
For more information regarding resource management and resource typing, see Appendix F.
INCIDENT SUPPORT BASE 
3-50. Installations selected as incident support bases are expected to continue military mission operations,
in addition to those imposed by the incident support base mission. Installation commanders are prepared to
request personnel, material, and equipment augmentation as necessary. As explained in the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff DSCA Executive Order and U.S. Northern Command Concept Plan 3501, incident
support base is temporary in nature and uses resources not required for the preparation or conduct of military
operations.
3-51. A base support installation (BSI) is a Department of Defense Service or agency installation within
CONUS and its territories tasked to serve as a base for military forces engaged in either homeland defense or
conducting defense support of civil authorities. (JP 3-28) A BSI is normally a DOD federal installation or
leased facility of any Service or agency. BSI is normally located outside of, but proximate to, the incident
area. BSI must have utilities, communications, and access to open-road networks since they are the primary
logistics hubs during a DSCA response. Consistent with DODD 3025.18 and JP 3-28, an incident support base
is a DOD installation that provides specified, integrated resource support to the DSCA.
3-52. The normally requested installation support as an incident support base includes covered warehouse
space and secure (fenced) hard stand parking areas where commercial semi-trailers loaded with commodities
can be staged prior to being directed forward to supply state staging facilities, shelters, or point of distributions
(POD). The incident support base may also be requested to provide airfield facilities to accept the arrival of
federal-owned commodities and trans-load from aircraft to truck for further shipment. Incident support base
is a DOD installation or leased facility of any DOD component which is in or near an actual or projected
domestic operational area and which has the capability to serve in general support of DOD forces involved in
civil disaster response operations.

3-53. The designation as an incident support base may require the installation to provide one or more
installation support roles, including ports of embarkation, ports of debarkation, intermediate staging bases,
and/or forward operating bases. Consistent with DODD 3025.18 and JP 3-28, incident support bases have the
following capabilities—

Close proximity to the incident site (less than 100 miles).

Close proximity to a major airfield.

Life support services (such as billeting, food service, fuel, contracting, medical support, and FP).

Open and covered areas for the staging of supplies and equipment.

Adequate transportation network to and from the incident site.

Communications infrastructure sufficient to meet the surge of forces arriving in the area.
3-54. Depending on the nature and scope of assets organic to an installation, the installation may or may not
be requested to provide support in the form of an incident support base. However, every installation
commander is aware of the assets that may be requested of their installation in this event. In addition,
installation commanders understand the planning considerations for an installation to function as an incident
support base. Consistent with DODD 3025.18 and JP 3-28, incident support base planning considerations take
into account key functions of logistics for operations, including—

A concise concept of purpose and a description of the functions the installation will support.

The forces required to support the operation and phasing for the induction of logistic elements.

A joint field office in the affected area.

A FEMA mobilization location.

The length of time the installation will provide support.

Transportation suitability.

Adequate supply, maintenance, transportation, civil engineer, medical, and other service support
on the installation.
Note. For more details and a checklist on incident support base planning considerations, see JP 3-
28. 
JOINT RECEPTION, STAGING, ONWARD MOVEMENT, AND 
ITEGRATION (JRSOI) 
3-55. JRSOI is the critical link between the deployment and employment of response forces in an operational
area. The reception of forces and the subsequent staging at the incident support base are key to the JRSOI.
3-56. Consistent with JP 3-35, Deployment and Redeployment Operations, the deploying force (usually a
joint task force) utilizes organic assets when possible to assist and expedite reception and staging operations.
Depending on the size and scope of the deploying response force, the incident support base may require
additional equipment and personnel with specialized capabilities to conduct JRSOI. Installations identify
shortfalls in equipment, personnel, and other resources through their operational chain of command. Special
requirements of the deploying force (such as armory or kennel services or classified material storage) are
coordinated early in the planning process to ensure their availability.
3-57. An incident support base may be tasked to support the medium- to large-scale staging of logistics
assets, including tractor trailers, portable facilities, and supply and logistic centers. An incident support base
may also be tasked to support the forward staging (mobilization site) of manpower and ground/air/sea
transportation assets for direct movement to the emergency site in-place of the staging of heavy logistic assets
and depots.
3-58. EM programs facilitate the planning for, preparing for, developing required capabilities for, and
supporting JRSOI during DSCA. However, the decision to designate an installation as an incident support
base or to provide support to JRSOI is dependent on whether or not the installation has the organic capability
to support those needs. The installation does not preplan for such a response until a standing Executive Order
directs the installation to do so.

28 July 2021 
ACTIVATION OF SUPPORT AGREEMENTS 
3-59. Support agreements are activated through predetermined activation and reporting mechanisms to meet
the needs of the emergency incident. These agreements may be activated through the EOC or by the on-scene
IC as outlined by the agreement and EMP. EMPs include procedures for the eventual demobilization of
supplied resources through existing support agreements.
SUMMARY 
3-60. An incident may begin with or without a warning period. For example, an approaching hurricane versus
a sudden earthquake. As soon as an incident or the threat of an incident occurs, EM operations shift from the
protection mode to the response mode. When an incident or event begins, the execution of NIMS and ICS
procedures allows for a coordinated, interoperable, and expandable response structure on and off the
installation. The IC directs on-scene response activities from the ICP and reports to the installation
commander. The EOC manages support operations on behalf of the installation commander. The coordination
and integration of support activities, especially communications and resource management, are integral to an
efficient and effective incident response effort.

Recover 
There often is no distinct break between the time response operations end and recovery 
operations begin. Recovery often begins while response operations are still in progress. 
In addition, recovery activities often extend long after the initial incident response 
phase is complete. Short-term recovery actions seek to restore essential services and 
ensure the immediate needs of the impacted installation community are met. Longer-
term recovery actions include fully restoring remaining noncritical operations, 
rebuilding destroyed property, and reconstituting other noncritical services. The main 
goal of recovery is mission reconstitution and the restoration of essential operations. 
The National Disaster Recovery Framework enables effective recovery support to 
disaster-impacted states, tribes, territorial and local jurisdictions. It provides a flexible 
structure that enables disaster recovery managers to operate in a unified and 
collaborative manner. The National Disaster Recovery Framework identifies recovery 
support functions that provide a structure to facilitate problem solving, improve access 
to resources, and foster coordination among state and Federal agencies, tribes, 
territories, nongovernmental partners and stakeholders.

RECOVERY MANAGEMENT 
4-3. 
The primary tasks of an installation during the initial recovery phase are to complete any remaining
mitigation of the immediate hazard and finish restoring mission capability and essential public and government 
services interrupted by an event. The primary tasks of an installation during long-term recovery are to restore
full operations and public services and to rebuild destroyed property. Other tasks may include the
development, coordination, and execution of service- and site-restoration plans; programs to provide housing
and to promote restoration; long-term care and treatment of affected persons; evaluation of the incident to
identify lessons learned; post-incident reporting; and development of initiatives to mitigate the effects of future 
incidents.
RECOVERY WORKING GROUP 
4-4. 
The installation commander establishes a recovery working group early in the recovery phase of every
emergency where recovery operations require coordination in the judgment of the installation commander.
The recovery working group is preidentified for likely events within the EMPs. The recovery working group
is a task-organized working group focused on the evaluation, prioritization, and coordination of recovery
requirements. The recovery working group, with the technical direction of the installation emergency manager
and the installation public works/civil engineer representative, conducts recovery planning at the installation
level.
4-5. 
The recommended composition of the recovery working group is shown in table 4-2.

RECOVERY PLANNING 
4-6. 
The recovery working group obtains additional information then develops and implements a recovery
plan. The recovery plan provides detailed, incident-specific procedures for short- and long-term recovery. The
EOC uses the EMP to assist in developing a detailed recovery plan based on damage assessment information
and priorities established by the installation commander.
4-7. 
While the EMP facilitates response and short-term recovery, the recovery plan provides detailed,
incident-specific processes and procedures, including the immediate restoration of transportation and
communication capabilities, search and rescue operations, utility reconstruction, community reconstruction,
site remediation, medical care or mitigation, and other activities necessary for successful long-term recovery.
4-8. 
During the transition to follow-on operations, the installation commander balances between focusing
resources on mission-essential tasks versus completing recovery tasks. Limitations of resources require
installation decision makers to prioritize and concentrate on the tasks needed to recover installation missions
and operations to full capability.
4-9. 
As in the response phase, commanders and their staffs use a COP to obtain a quick, timely, usable,
precise, and reliable view of the status of an incident. During the recovery phase, the COP is capable of
supporting all aspects of the recovery operations (hazard locations, unit response capabilities, unit exposure
status, and updated risk assessments).
4-10. Long-term recovery after a major event usually takes years to complete. Installation commanders
establish recovery priorities consistent with the installation’s mission. Consideration is given to operational

mission priorities and the reestablishment of the normal OE, as well as activities such as housing/facility 
construction, transportation restoration, community reconstruction, environmental remediation, and continued 
delivery of EPI. 
SUSTAINMENT AND RESTORATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
OPERATIONS 
4-11. The restoration of the installation infrastructure involves coordination with the installation public
works department and civilian jurisdiction service providers, public or private. EM programs coordinate
infrastructure recovery plans before an incident to effectively restore infrastructure after the incident occurs.
4-12. The restoration, in concert with mission continuation tasks, officially begins when the IC advises the
EOC director the incident has been sufficiently controlled or terminated and the security of the situation is
sufficient to begin restoration activity. Consequently, the EOC directs and coordinates infrastructure recovery
inspections and reports damage by using “quick looks” and detailed assessments.
4-13. The damage assessment and impact analysis are essential to determining the magnitude, scope, scale,
and extent of an emergency. Damage assessment results guide the determination of priorities, identification
of required resources, and justification for assistance and supplemental funding requests. The public works
asset may conduct physical damage assessments, if such a capability exists within the installation. Installations 
establish processes for damage assessment and debris clearance. These capabilities support short-term (less
than two weeks in duration) recovery efforts and initial damage assessments, resource projections, and
recovery planning requirements. The damage assessment process begins as soon as possible after an incident
occurs to assess the level of human suffering and infrastructure impacts and continues throughout the recovery 
phase. See the FEMA Damage Assessment Operations Manual for additional information.
4-14. A reliable, rapid field damage assessment increases the likelihood recovery funds and other resources
are properly prioritized and targeted. Damage assessments also provide policymakers with guidance for
planning and implementing mitigation measures. The field-based assessment acts as ground truth for larger,
more comprehensive assessments, such as satellite-based assessments. The objective of rapid field damage
assessments is to get a quick, reliable overview of the following damage-related issues—

Is there damage to the environment?

What is the damage to utilities and other supportive infrastructure?

Are there impacts to livelihood because of the damage?

What role, if any, did preincident mitigation measures play in reducing the impact of the incident,
and under what circumstances and to what extent did this occur?
4-15. After basic reconstruction activities have been completed, the long-term process of recovery begins.
Restoration decisions focus installation resources on critical and essential operations and infrastructure,
including maintaining safety, preventing the further loss of combat power, maintaining or restoring installation
integrity and security, restoring C2 over forces, restoring the primary mission, and supporting other forces.
Restoration capabilities include measures required to restore the force, units, facilities, and equipment to near-
normal operating conditions after a major accident or natural disaster. These measures include
decontamination operations and the effective supply and sustainment of response assets.
4-16. Restoration actions, in progress or intended, are recorded and are a part of the recovery plan. From this
record, several actions are enabled. Those actions include estimating repair costs and determining whether the
repairs will be accomplished in-house or by contract, estimating the recovery date and time, ascertaining
required assistance, and assessing the impact on the combat readiness status of installation forces.
MASS CARE 
4-17. Care for the base populace during recovery includes providing temporary housing and behavioral
health and counseling services. Detailed TTP for mass care are included in Appendix H, but the fundamentals
are discussed in paragraphs 4-18 through 4-20.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
4-5
HOUSING OPERATIONS 
4-18. Temporary housing is where displaced personnel live from the time they leave a safe haven or civilian
shelter until the time they return to their previous home or a new home. Temporary housing is in a livable
condition; has sufficient utilities/services; is pest-, mold-, and mildew-free; and is properly prepared
(ventilated and cleaned) by safe haven residents before occupancy. Before occupancy, personnel need to fully
understand the rules, timelines, and responsibilities concerning the use of temporary housing, such as the
expected occupancy time, financial responsibilities (such as utilities, damages, supplies, and appliances),
general logistics (such as parking, utilities, supplies, and quiet hours), and expected behavior. Examples of
temporary housing include barracks, dormitories, bachelor quarters, visitors quarters, previously available
family housing units, recreational lodging, hotels, rented apartments or homes in the local economy, mobile
homes, and vacation properties. The coordination of temporary housing needs is the responsibility of the
installation housing office in support of the recovery working group. Temporary housing needs for animals is
also considered and identified.
4-19. Installations should not rush into permanent housing solutions until a revised community profile has
been completed and the installation has the infrastructure and services necessary to support the estimated
population. It is important to address changes in the installation populace, especially designated place
relocations, during this process.
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELING AND RELIGIOUS SERVICES 
4-20. A critical recovery operation that is often overlooked during the planning process is the provision of
behavioral health counseling services and religious service support to anyone affected by the incident in the
installation community. This important process begins the day of the incident and remains ongoing until full
recovery is established. The behavioral health and well-being of the installation community is the most vital
component to a complete and sustainable recovery effort.
DEBRIS CLEARANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION 
4-21. Installations establish contracting vehicles to be used for debris clearance and environmental
remediation in the event of an incident requiring these services. These contracts include, but are not limited
to, MAA/MOU/MOA/ISSAs, indefinite quantity contracts, the logistics civil augmentation program, and the
emergency construction capabilities contract. Contracts should not be limited to local vendors or commands,
because these capabilities may be lost or overtasked during an emergency.
4-22. The debris management process begins as soon as possible after an incident occurs to permit access to
the incident site by designated personnel, to remove life safety and environmental hazards, and to mitigate
further environmental contamination throughout the recovery phase. Debris management capabilities at an
installation may be restricted by safety considerations and may be limited to providing initial clearance
operations and consolidating debris at one or more sites (see Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]
Document, Planning for Natural Disaster Debris, for additional information on debris management).
4-23. Remediation begins upon the completion of a contamination survey and continues until all
contamination has been removed or remediated. The scope and duration of the remediation depends on the
agent or material. The post-event assessment includes medical, environmental, and public works.
4-24. Remediation operations follow the neutralization and removal of hazardous substance contamination.
Imminent threats to personnel or the environment are alleviated during neutralization or removal operations,
so remediation operations normally take place in a nonemergency setting. See ATP 3-11.32/MCRP 10-
10E.8/NTTP 3-11.37/AFTTP 3-2.46, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Passive Defense, for additional information on CBRN
decontamination.
4-25. Remediation is usually performed by civilian environmental consultant firms under contract to the
Service or under the supervision of the EPA or the Department of Energy, depending on the nature of the
event. The identification, investigation, research, development, and cleanup of contamination from hazardous
substances, pollutants, and contaminants are to be carried out subject to, and consistent with, the
Chapter 4

28 July 2021 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and other Federal regulatory 
guidance. 
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
4-26. Recovery involves the final disposition of all resources. During this process, resources are
rehabilitated, replenished, disposed of, and retrograded.
4-27. While many recovery activities can occur by utilizing organic and precoordinated capabilities available
to the installation, many longer-term recovery actions require external requests and coordination for assets
unavailable to a typical installation command. Consistent with DODI 3020.52, installation commanders utilize
reachback assets and support agreements to sustain and complete the recovery mission.
4-28. Resource management in recovery continues to include processes for categorizing, ordering,
dispatching, tracking, and demobilizing resources and personnel. Resource management during recovery may
also include processes for the reimbursement for resources, as appropriate.
4-29. Reimbursement provides a mechanism to fund critical needs that arise from incident-specific activities.
Reimbursement processes also play an important role in establishing and maintaining the readiness of
resources. Processes and procedures are in-place to ensure resource providers are reimbursed in a timely
manner. These include mechanisms for tracking expenditures, collecting bills, validating costs against the
scope of the work, ensuring proper authorities are involved, and accessing reimbursement programs.
4-30. Emergency cost accounting is a key function during an emergency. Emergency cost accounting can be
accomplished by the IC or EOC finance and administration sections or by another installation entity after the
EOC/IC are stood down. It is important to develop and standardize procedures to rapidly develop and manage
emergency cost accounting codes to track emergency-related expenses, including those incurred under support 
agreements and support contracts. These emergency and special purpose codes are issued by a designated
Service authority. It is also important to consolidate and forward cost estimates identified during the damage
assessment process to the appropriate installation-owning command as directed. It is the responsibility of
installation-owning commands to develop the overarching emergency funding lines necessary to consolidate
multiple emergency cost account codes that may be in use by multiple installations at the same time.
4-31. The installation business office or comptroller develops and approves procedures for expediting fiscal
decisions during emergencies consistent with established authorization levels and fiscal policy. This
framework provides for maximum flexibility to expediently request, receive, manage, and apply funds in a
nonemergency environment and in emergency situations to ensure the timely delivery of assistance. The
administrative process is documented through written procedures. The program is also capable of capturing
financial data for future cost recovery, as well as identifying and accessing alternative funding sources and
managing budgeted and specially appropriated funds.
MORTUARY AFFAIRS 
4-32. Fatality management is a logistics function regarding the management, transportation, handling and, if
necessary, temporary internment of human remains. Mortuary affairs is a larger function of identifying the
human remains; notifying and assisting the family of the deceased; transporting the remains, if necessary; and
conducting permanent interment. EM programs coordinate with their logistics lead and supporting MTF on
the availability and capabilities for fatality management (for the Air Force, fatality management is a force
support function).
4-33. EMPs include predetermined responsibilities and procedures for the identification, decontamination
(if applicable), and handling of human remains, including mass fatality incidents. This may require support
from the civilian medical examiner in the event installation assets are overwhelmed.
4-34. Consistent with JP 4-0, Joint Logistics, mortuary affairs support may be requested by civil authorities
in the event of a mass casualty incident. The support provided by DOD mortuary affairs personnel is then
tailored to the needs of the requesting authority. The request could vary from personnel transporting human
remains, to an identification process, to a complete excavation of a disaster site.

4-7
PUBLIC HEALTH/PREVENTIVE MEDICINE 
4-35. The public health of the protected populace requires continued monitoring and actions throughout
recovery. Health risks, such as a lack of access to safe drinking water and safe and approved food sources and
animal feed, can severely disrupt the recovery process. The core functions of public health are health risk
assessment, risk mitigation, and communication of health risks to the public. See the Center of Disease Control
(CDC) manual, Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Capabilities, for additional information.
4-36. Other public health considerations include—

Establishing sanitary conditions for workers and residents.

Establishing vector control of mosquitoes, rats, and other disease vectors.

Advising housing authorities regarding mold and mildew assessments and removal operations
necessary for housing reoccupation.

Managing public health issues resulting from a lack of water treatment facilities.

Advising on wastewater pump and treatment operations.

Advising on solid waste collection and disposal operations.

Continuing syndromic surveillance operations to include personnel injured or exposed to
hazardous conditions during response and recovery operations.

Continuing occupational health surveillance of response personnel.

Coordinating as needed with mortuary affairs for the safe handling and dignity in transporting
human remains.

Coordinating veterinary guidance regarding military working animals, other government-owned
animals and privately owned pets.
VETERINARY SERVICES 
4-37. The Army is the lead Service for providing veterinary service support to all DOD components. The
primary missions of Army veterinary services in recovery phase may be food protection (food defense and
food safety), veterinary public health, diagnostic laboratory for food samples and animal specimens, and
veterinary medical care to government owned workings animals.
SUMMARY 
4-38. Recovery is a long-term process that begins as an overlap with the response phase. Of the five phases,
recovery is the most time- and resource-intensive. Depending on the nature of the incident, full community
and economic recovery can take many months to many years and require significant budgetary expenditures.
Prioritizing the tasks necessary to recoup losses will help with time and budget management as the installation
commander and staff start down the long road to recovery.

Mitigate 
Mitigation actions involve the lasting reduction of, exposure to, probability of, or 
potential loss from identified hazards. The goal of mitigation efforts is to reduce the 
impact of identified hazards on critical and essential operations, critical assets, critical 
infrastructure, essential services, assigned personnel, and government and personal 
property. Mitigation activities provide a critical foundation in the effort to reduce 
injuries and the loss of life and property from natural/manmade disasters by avoiding 
or lessening the impact of a disaster. Mitigation efforts are taken before during, and 
after an emergency and should be an ongoing process that feeds directly into the overall 
preparedness of the installation. Multiple functional areas execute mitigation tasks as 
a normal part of their operations. The National Mitigation Framework establishes a 
common platform and forum for coordinating and addressing how the Nation manages 
risk through mitigation capabilities.

VULNERABILITY REDUCTION 
5-3. 
Vulnerability reduction tools assist in the identification of mitigation efforts that may negate or reduce
the effects of identified hazards. Vulnerability reduction measures tie into the results from the risk
management process that takes place throughout the EM cycle (see Appendix B). Examples of vulnerability
reduction and mitigation activities are included in table 5-1.
5-4. 
Vulnerability reduction also can involve educating businesses and personnel on the measures they can
take to reduce loss and injury. These measure may include fastening bookshelves, water heaters, and file
cabinets to walls to keep them from falling during earthquakes.
5-5. 
Key areas of concern regarding mitigation activities include—

Utility systems, especially power and water treatment distribution.

Dams and levees.


5-6. 
Mitigation actions can be grouped into the following categories—

Prevention. Prevention actions are the administrative or regulatory actions or processes that
influence the ways in which land and buildings are developed and built. These actions also include
public activities to reduce hazard losses. Examples include planning and zoning, building codes,
capital improvement programs, open space preservation, and storm water management
regulations.

Property protection. Property protection actions involve the modification of existing buildings or
structures to protect them from a hazard or the removal of property from the hazard area. Examples
include acquisition, elevation, relocation, structural retrofits, storm shutters, and shatter-resistant
glass.

Public education and awareness. Public education and awareness actions inform and educate the
installation populace about hazards and potential ways to mitigate them. Such actions include
outreach projects, hazard information centers, and school-age and adult education programs.

Natural resource protection. In addition to minimizing hazard losses, natural resource protection
actions preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. These actions include sediment and
erosion control, stream corridor restoration, watershed management, forest and vegetation
management, and wetland restoration and preservation.

Emergency services. Emergency service actions protect people and property during and
immediately after a disaster or hazard event. Services include warning systems, emergency
response services, and critical facility protection efforts.

Structural projects. Structural project actions involve the construction of structures to reduce the
impact of a hazard. Such structures include dams, levees, floodwalls, seawalls, retaining walls,
and safe rooms.
5-7. 
The role of the installation emergency manager in mitigation activities is to participate in planning
mitigation efforts under an integrated strategy through the EMWG to ensure a cohesive and effective effort.
Mitigation activities are executed by the applicable functional leads. Mitigation phase activities draw from a
large number of resources established by Federal and private sources. Many of these resources are available
at the FEMA mitigation Web site at https://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-planning and at the FEMA
Building Science Branch Web site at https://www.fema.gov/building-science.
5-8. 
The installation coordinates pre- and post-event mitigation efforts with owners of specific
technological hazards (dams; levees; airfields; rail transportation systems; mass transit systems; ferry systems;
petrochemical facilities; related manufacturing, storage, or transportation systems) with the potential or
historical impact to the installation. A best practice for this process is to coordinate these activities with the
emergency managers of local civil jurisdictions.

MITIGATION PLANNING 
5-11. According to FEMA, mitigation planning is the process used to identify risks and vulnerabilities
associated with natural disasters. It is also used to develop long-term strategies for protecting people and
property in future hazard events. The process results in a mitigation plan that offers a strategy for breaking the
cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repeated damage and presents a framework for developing
feasible and cost-effective mitigation projects. Cost-effective mitigation measures are the key to reducing
disaster losses in the long term.
5-12. Mitigation planning is considered by the EMWG with the technical direction of the installation
emergency manager and in coordination with appropriate functional area representatives (such as public
works, AT, Federal fire, and information technology). While the functional area representatives are wholly
responsible for the planning and implementation of mitigation measures on the installation, the EMWG
mitigation plan captures the interim and long-term actions and goals of the installation to reduce the impact of
hazards and threats that cannot be eliminated. A mitigation plan is a supporting plan to (or a plan element or
component of) the EMP. The best practice is to identify a mitigation committee of select members of the
EMWG to create and maintain this plan.
5-13. The installation mitigation plan is used to guide the combined mitigation efforts of relevant functional
areas. It describes the physical, information technological, and nonmaterial mitigation strategies associated
with hazards identified during the risk management process.
5-14. A mitigation plan includes—

A discussion of the planning process and partners involved.

A discussion of the hazards and associated potential losses.

Goals aimed at reducing or avoiding losses from identified hazards.

Mitigation actions that help accomplish established goals.

Strategies that detail how the mitigation actions will be implemented and administered.

A description of how and when the plan will be updated.
LESSONS LEARNED 
5-15. Just as with the evaluation of training or an exercise, lessons learned from a real-world incident on an
installation are documented and acted on to strengthen the EM program and mitigate effects of future incidents.
Immediately following an incident, installation staff who were active in the response and recovery efforts
participate in a debriefing activity to capture best practices and lessons learned for inclusion in an AAR on the
incident.
5-16. The AAR includes recommendations for the remediation of current EM practices to reflect lessons
learned during the incident. AARs also include dissemination and notification of successes and shortfalls,
installation-wide response checklists, deficiencies, deficiency correction plans, required training efforts,
implementation dates, corrective actions, follow-up actions, and lessons learned. Higher headquarters
establishes internal after-action reporting procedures to ensure reporting objectives are met, problems are
solved, and results are disseminated.
5-17. As outlined in NIMS and HSEEP, lessons learned documented in the AAR are used to construct an IP
and CAP. The IP and CAP are used (at a minimum) to restructure the EMP for better readiness and response.
5-18. The IP converts lessons learned from the incident into concrete, measurable steps that result in
improved EM capabilities. It specifically details the actions that will be taken to address each recommendation
presented in the AAR, who or what agency will be responsible for taking the action, and the timeline for
completion.
5-19. The CAP tracks and assesses progress on enhancing preparedness and incorporating information into
the emergency planning process. This process may identify needs for additional coordination, plans,
procedures, organization, manning, training, equipment, and exercises. The CAP includes the incorporation
of recommendations into updates to the risk management process and the annual revision of the EMP. The

5-6
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
CAP is closed out when improvements have been implemented and validated through subsequent exercises 
and records are maintained on file as appropriate. 
5-20. Lessons learned are key outputs of the AAR and reflect best practices, consistent challenges and issues,
and recommended solutions based on the evaluation of the incident. The Joint Lessons Learned Program is a
knowledge-sharing process established to enhance joint capabilities through discovery, knowledge
development, implementation, and the sharing of lessons from joint operations, training events, exercises, and
other activities. The Joint Lessons Learned Program applies to the full range of joint operations, including
training, exercises, experiments, real-world events, and other activities involving DOD assets of the Armed
Forces of the U.S.
5-21. Installations are also encouraged to engage with the Homeland Security Digital Library
(https://www.hsdl.org/), under the Special Collections dropdown menu. The posting of lessons learned on the
portal is permitted if approved by the installation commander after a legal review by the installation legal
office.
SUMMARY 
5-22. Vulnerability reduction efforts are critical to implementing an effective mitigation strategy on an
installation. The installation emergency manager, through the EMWG, participates in the development of an
installation mitigation strategy that is captured in the installation mitigation plan. This plan may support, or
be a component of, the EMP. Throughout the EM cycle, installation emergency managers coordinate
installation-wide mitigation efforts that are led by appropriate functional area representatives. Following an
event or exercise, installation staff captures lessons learned during response and recovery phases and uses
them to better inform their mitigation activities in the future. Lessons learned on an installation and from other
collaborating partners are integral to enhancing an installation mitigation strategy.

Appendix B 
Risk Management 
EM planning is predicated on threat/hazard, vulnerability, and capability assessments. 
These assessments are used to evaluate the ability of an installation to respond to a 
threat or hazard, protect the population on the installation, and implement future 
strategies to mitigate risks. 
PROCESS 
B-1. Risk management is a continuous process of reviewing critical infrastructure, assets, missions, hazards,
threats, vulnerabilities, consequences, and existing response capabilities to determine what additional actions
are needed to achieve or maintain a desired level of readiness and to protect the population on the installation.
As shown in figure B-1, a full-scale risk assessment process is configured on the probability of a threat or
hazard occurring; the vulnerability of an installation against that threat or hazard; the consequence or
magnitude of negative effects of the threat or hazard; the relative value of critical infrastructure, assets, and
missions; and the existing response capabilities for the remediation of effects post-event.
Figure B-1. Risk assessment process 
B-2. At a minimum, a risk assessment is dependent on a comprehensive, all-hazards process that includes—

Hazard threat assessments.

A vulnerability assessment.

A capability assessment.

A risk evaluation.
B-3. A risk assessment may also include assessments of criticality, consequence, cost-benefit, and need.
Risk factors from these assessments are combined in a risk evaluation that qualifies and/or quantifies risks
and impacts future decisions for installation mitigation measures.
Appendix B 
B-2
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
B-4. These assessments incorporate information and recommendations from a variety of sources. Sources
may include, but are not limited to, higher headquarters assessments, Joint Staff MA assessments, CIP
planning and assessments, COOP planning activities, and exercise deficiencies.
B-5. The risk management process is performed and documented by the EMWG under the authority of the
installation commander and in coordination with functional areas such as AT, CBRN defense, Federal fire,
and CIP. The completion of the risk management process occurs before the development of the initial
EMP/EMP update and is an ongoing process. Effective risk management requires support from the EMWG
and, as appropriate, from state, local, and tribal governments; other military Services; or HN partners in the
local community.
B-6. The intent of the risk management process is not to fixate on a 100 percent solution or on the resolution
of every variable to a defined quantity, but rather to provide a context in which to view relative risk across
the entire enterprise in as much of an objective manner as possible, given the hazards. The risk management
process provides a logical process to prioritize the development of specific capabilities and the application
of limited financial and human resources to specific capabilities. Using the risk management process, the
EMWG can prioritize investments into those capabilities most applicable to local conditions and needs. The
process identifies key preparedness, mitigation, and prevention opportunities, which reduce overall risk to
the installation.
B-7. Risk decisions are ultimately the responsibility of the installation commander and are made at the
lowest possible level, except in extreme circumstances. Leaders and staffs manage risk. Staff members
continuously look for hazards associated with their areas of expertise and then recommend controls to reduce
risks. The role of the EMWG in the installation risk management process is to identify controls, develop a
process to implement them, recommend solutions to the installation commander, and implement the resulting
decision.
CRITICALITY ASSESSMENTS 
B-8. Some Services use criticality (also referred to as critical asset or critical infrastructure) assessments as
inputs to their risk evaluation as shown in figure B-1, page B-1. In most cases, these criticality assessments
have already been developed by AT or CIP programs.
B-9. The criticality assessment evaluates command missions and functions capabilities and determines
mission impact or the consequence of the loss of assets that support command mission execution. Critical
assets can be people, physical entities, systems, or information that provides a service or capability. The
analysis examines those assets for which degradation or destruction impact the command ability to complete
its assigned missions or functions.
B-10. DODI 3020.45 describes the critical asset identification process (also see JP 3-07.2, Antiterrorism).
There are other assets that may not be critical to the execution of the mission or function that may be identified
in this criticality process and included in the overall risk assessment process. These noncritical assets could
include assets like high-population facilities, such as theaters, commissaries, and base exchanges.
HAZARD/THREAT ASSESSMENTS 
B-11. The development of an all-hazards threat assessment accomplishes these goals—

The identification of a comprehensive list of threats and hazards.

The likelihood or probability of occurrence of each threat or hazard.

In the context of assessing risk, the higher the probability or likelihood of a threat or hazard
occurring, the higher the risk of loss will be to the asset.
B-12. EM considers all hazards that may impact the installation. These hazards vary among installations. For
example, hurricanes may be a significant natural hazard concern in the Southeast Region, but not in the
Pacific Northwest. Tsunamis are of concern in the Pacific Northwest, but generally not in the Southeast.
B-13.  Toxic industrial materials are of concern at almost all installations. FEMA recommends including
several other factors into the hazard assessment, including the time available until the onset of the hazard and

B-3
the possibility of a single event to cascade and cause other failures. It is also beneficial for installation EM 
programs to coordinate threat and hazard assessments with state, local, and HN EM agencies. 
B-14. While the Federal government has a number of hazard-specific organizations that provide hazard
information for specific geographic areas, the Services will use the appropriate Service meteorological and
oceanographic agencies for weather-related hazards, resorting to Federal offices only if support is
unavailable. Examples include—

National Weather Service.

National Hurricane Center.

National Climatic Data Center.

U.S. Geological Survey.

National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

U.S. Volcanic Observatories.

National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.

National Tsunami Hazards Reduction Program.

Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program.

Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program.

FEMA Office for Domestic Preparedness.

EPA.

Department of Transportation, National Response Center.

National Interagency Fire Center.
B-15. FEMA has a number of programs for consolidating and providing hazard information to state
governments. In addition, each state and local jurisdiction applying for Federal grant funding completes a
thorough hazard assessment as part of the grant process. HN programs vary greatly, but most nations,
provinces, and cities include a hazard assessment as part of their EM or civil defense programs (see DODI
3020.52 for CBRNE specific guidance).
B-16. Terrorism and sabotage threats to strategic, operational, and mission-essential assets are also assessed.
Installation commanders utilize existing threat assessment methods to gather and analyze the threats
potentially impacting the installation on an ongoing basis and no less than annually. Threat information is
integrated to meet the collective Force Protection needs of EM, CBRN Defense, explosive ordnance disposal
(EOD), AT, CIP, and COOP planning. Installation commanders continuously ensure that forces are trained
to maximize the use of threat assessments and intelligence derived from liaisons to civil and military LE and
public safety agencies and departments and from EM, meteorological, environmental, mental/behavioral
health, veterinary services, public health/preventive medicine, occupational and environmental health
surveillance, and medical syndromic surveillance processes and procedures.
B-17. Each Service maintains its own terrorist threat analysis capability. Although DOD threat levels may
only be set by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), special investigation offices and information fusion
centers can provide valuable assessments to installation commands regarding terrorist threats for specific,
localized areas. The following are primary sources of terrorism threat assessment data that contribute to
indications and warnings for U.S. military forces—

USMC Forces Intelligence Department (G-2) or Information Fusion Center. The G-2 is the focal
point for the intelligence support for FP related intelligence, information, and counterintelligence
(CI) issues for USMC assets within their respective area of responsibility. The Information Fusion
Center oversees the correlation of LE information in order to provide a domestic summary
consistent with other DOD intelligence oversight directives.

Naval Criminal Investigative Service Multiple Threat Alert Center threat products. Products
include time-sensitive spot or suspicious activity reports, warning reports, CI terrorism
supplements, annual regional threat assessments, port threat assessments, and baseline study
reports.

Army CI Center threat products. Products include monthly international terrorism summaries,
multi-disciplined CI threat assessments, and Army CI Center information papers.


Air Force Office of Special Investigations threat products. Products include CI notes and the “Blue
Line” a daily synopsis of global incidents of interest to Air Force personnel.

DIA Joint Intelligence Task Force for Combating Terrorism (JITF-CT). Disseminates intelligence
on foreign terrorist threats, including the specific warning of threats against DOD personnel,
facilities, and other DOD material resources. Additionally, DIA produces a threat assessment
triennially, or if required, more frequently.

Geographic combatant command area of responsibility. A specific supplement to the DIA,
produced global threats report.

DHS Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intelligence and analysis reports. FBI field intelligence 
groups are the hub of the FBI intelligence program. These reports contribute to local and regional
perspectives on threats and serve as the primary intelligence link between the FBI and fusion
centers.

DHS intelligence reports. Includes DHS daily open-source infrastructure reports, digital library
critical releases, advisory system threat levels, daily infectious disease reports, daily drug
trafficking and smuggling reports, central digests, and daily cyber reports.
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS (VA) 
B-18. Vulnerability is a measure of the robustness of in-place installation and asset safeguards that are taken
to prevent or mitigate a threat or hazard from impacting an installation. Vulnerabilities define the weaknesses
or susceptibilities of an installation, system, asset, or application and identify its dependencies that could
cause it to suffer a degradation or loss (incapacity to perform its designated function) as a result of having
been subjected to a certain level of threat or hazard effects. The VA consists of the determination of the
potential vulnerability of an installation or specific function to an identified hazard.
B-19. Vulnerabilities to a critical asset can result from a wide variety of factors (design and construction
flaws, environmental factors, proximity to other structures or systems, factors influencing accessibility,
personal behaviors of people working in or around the critical assets, operational practices associated with
the critical assets or the installation). Vulnerabilities of a critical asset can also be determined by
vulnerabilities to other assets or areas that are not in close proximity to the critical asset. For instance,
vulnerabilities in access or perimeter control of an installation may lead to an adversary gaining access to the
installation and, ultimately, to the critical asset located somewhere inside the installation.
B-20. Installation commanders conduct a local AT VA as outlined in DODI 2000.12, DOD Antiterrorism
(AT) Program, and DODI O-2000.16, Volume 1, for facilities, installations, and critical nodes within their
areas of responsibility on an annual basis or, as required, more frequently. This VA addresses the broad range
of threats to the installation and personnel. Existing AT VAs are used to establish the vulnerability of an
installation or specific function to terrorist threats, but installation EM personnel still conduct a thorough VA
for natural and manmade hazards not included within the AT scope.
B-21. VAs of installations—

Focus on the overarching EM and AT programs of the command.

Determine asset-specific vulnerabilities applicable to particular threats and hazards.

Assess the vulnerability scope of an asset, such as a single weakness or multiple weaknesses in
the safeguard system.

Assess the degree of difficulty in exploiting the vulnerability. Analyze installation structure and
activities from the perspective of an adversary to obtain a basis for understanding real
vulnerabilities. This may be accomplished through written questionnaires and surveys.

Are classified according to appropriate security classification guides.

Are disseminated for internal use at least annually.
B-22. Process tools and resources for conducting VAs include—

Checklists and aids.

The Joint AT Program Manager’s Guide.

Higher headquarters assessments.

MTF hazard vulnerability analysis/threat assessment as part of overall installation assessment.

B-5
CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENTS 
B-23. Some Services also perform consequence assessments and use them as inputs to their risk evaluation
as shown in figure B-1, page B-1. The consequence assessment determines the potential consequences an
identified hazard may have on an installation or on a specific function at the current level of EM capability
of the installation. Consequence assessments include estimates for deaths, injuries, rebuilding infrastructure
costs, and the magnitude of disruption in mission capabilities.
CAPABILITY ASSESSMENTS 
B-24. The capability assessment determines the current level of EM capability of the installation based on
the integrated nonmaterial and material readiness of supporting functional areas. Capability assessments
factor in the mitigating effects of existing emergency response manpower, procedures, training, equipment,
and exercises to more accurately predict consequences. The capability assessment is especially important in
the identification of capability gaps (needs) that are addressed to reduce the consequence of a specific hazard
on an installation or on a specific function.
B-25. The objectives of the capability assessment are to—

Consider the range of identified and projected response capabilities necessary for responding to a
hazard.

List installation resources by type to provide an asset capability report.

Review policy, guidance, and planning documents to identify the organization mission-essential
tasks and functions assigned to the organization.

List installation personnel with a mission-essential task.

Identify costs associated with assessment outcomes for future budget planning.
RISK EVALUATIONS 
B-26. Effective risk management requires the assessment of each hazard be evaluated in terms of
vulnerability, consequence, and the capability of the installation to manage the resulting emergency. All
hazards are not equal in terms of probability or severity; therefore, risk evaluation can be used to establish
relative risk in order for the installation commander to conduct risk management across the entire jurisdiction
vice solely basing it on vulnerability or consequence of a specific hazard to a specific mission.
B-27. Risk factors resulting from assessments for the various threats and hazards to each critical
infrastructure asset mission are compared against each other to determine relative risks. This relative risk
evaluation assists in future resource allocation, prioritization, and acquisition planning. Costs and benefits
may need to be considered when deciding to acquire new resources.
B-28. Service-specific examples of risk evaluation templates and matrices are provided in table B-1, page
B-6; figure B-2, page B-7; table B-2, page B-8, and figure B-3, page B-9. The threats and hazards evaluated
in each figure are notional and represent a small fraction of the total risks an installation may need to evaluate.
DD Form 2977 (Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet) can be used for risk assessments as well.

NEEDS ASSESSMENT, COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS, AND 
MITIGATION DECISIONS 
B-29. The risk assessment process seeks to evaluate and identify risks to the installation and its critical
infrastructure assets missions based on the likelihood of threats and hazards occurring, the associated degrees
of vulnerabilities, and the response capability. The risk mitigation process determines options and actions to
reduce the risk of impact to the installation and its critical infrastructure assets missions. The options and
actions include mitigating risk, remediating the effects of loss once the threat/hazard event occurs,
reconstituting installation and asset capabilities after loss or disruption, acknowledging risk, and transferring
the risk decision to a higher echelon of command.
B-30. The needs assessment identifies additional risk mitigation strategies (procedures, training, activities,
countermeasures, equipment) needed to reduce the probability and consequences of priority threats and
hazards. Risk mitigation strategies that improve recovery are included in the analysis. Multiple layers of
protection (defense in depth) against the most critical risks are considered.
B-31. A key portion of the needs assessment analyzes and prioritizes the costs and benefits of risk mitigation
strategies. Strategies involving equipment, facilities, or additional personnel are prioritized, tracked, and
reported in time to support the budget process.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS REVIEWS 
B-32. Risk management is a continual process that evolves as hazards are identified, mitigation actions are
completed, prevention capabilities are developed and employed, and EM capabilities are developed to
respond to, and recover from, identified hazards threats. The risk management process is executed as a cycle.
Appendix B 
B-10
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
Once the risk management is complete, it is essential a thorough review of the overall process be conducted. 
This is typically done during the annual program review. 
B-33. Stakeholders in military and local civilian communities are involved in the review stage of the risk
management process. This coordination or collaboration ensures supporting plans align with the risk
management process. Stakeholders from the local community can also identify strengths and weaknesses,
focusing on collaboration between military and civilian agencies.
B-34. The final stage in the risk management process review is to exercise the plan and make adjustments as
needed. After the all-hazards risk management plan is implemented and set in motion, flaws may be identified
that could not be comprehended during the planning process. If this occurs, pursue immediate modification.

C-1
Appendix C 
Emergency Management Plan (EMP) 
The EMP is an important document for the support of installation preparation, 
response, and recovery operations. EMPs assign responsibilities to organizations and 
individuals within EM and across installation functional response communities, 
including assigned or attached personnel. EMPs facilitate coordination with 
organizational plans in support areas such as LE, medical and public health, 
communications, logistics, physical security, training, intelligence support, AT, F&ES, 
EOD, and HAZMAT. At a minimum, EMPs are reviewed annually and updated, as 
needed, to incorporate lessons learned and opportunities for improvement identified 
during real-life events, exercises, and risk management activities. 
KEY ELEMENTS 
C-1. EMPs are developed consistently with NPF and NIMS concepts and address, at a minimum, the
following—

Mission, goals, and objectives of the EM program.

Functional roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for personnel, organizations, and agencies
assigned to the EM response.

Preparedness activities, including:

Risk management.

Prevention planning that establishes interim and long-term actions to reduce or eliminate
identified hazards and threats to the installation.

Mitigation planning that establishes interim and long-term actions to reduce the impact of
hazards and threats that cannot be eliminated.

Training.

Exercises.

Interagency coordination.

Equipment.

Response planning that establishes response actions and assigns responsibilities for carrying out
those actions. Specific response planning considerations include:

COOP planning that identifies mission-essential functions and personnel, procedures, and
resources, contact information of stakeholders to be notified; ERSs to be setup; and functions
to be maintained while the installation is recovering.

Evacuation management and mass care planning that address family assistance, SIP,
lockdown, local and remote safe havens, civilian shelters, personnel accountability, special
needs management, animal needs management, behavioral health and religious support, and
family assistance centers.

Volunteer and donations management that establishes procedures for organizing and
coordinating the receipt of unsolicited services and goods in a manner that agrees with
applicable law and policy and does not interfere with ongoing response and recovery efforts.
Protocol to allow non-DOD first responders access to the installation during an emergency.
Recovery planning that provides short- and long-term priorities for the restoration of
functions, services, resources, facilities, and infrastructures.


Communications through all mission areas of an emergency that address communication
infrastructure (dispatch centers, enhanced 9-1-1 services, mobile CP and incident command
communication devices), EPI, and mass warning and reporting systems.
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
C-2. The development of a comprehensive, integrated, and executable EMP is the responsibility of the
installation commander. Command involvement is essential in the formation of a successful plan.
C-3. The lead for EMP development and maintenance is the installation emergency manager. No single
individual is tasked with the sole responsibility of developing an EMP. EMP development and documentation 
is a collective effort.
C-4. The most effective method of developing and documenting an EMP is through the utilization of a
cross-functional working group, such as the EMWG. This working group includes the ESF managers (or
office representatives) identified by the commander.
C-5. Using the EMWG enables the participation, input, and “buy-in” of necessary cross-functional subject
matter experts. Everyone involved in EMP development and documentation should be thoroughly familiar
with—

Applicable EM directives.

Previous EMPs and assessments.

Data developed earlier in the overall EM plan development process, including the results of threat,
vulnerability, and capability assessments.
C-6. The unpredictability of the EM mission, with respect to the all-hazards scope of the plan, requires the
EMP provide SOPs and instructions to conduct and coordinate specific EM measures that may apply to all-
hazards situations. Detailed “how to” instructions—

Permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans.

Focus on subordinate activities.

Provide tasks, activities, constraints, and coordinating instructions.

Do not inhibit initiative.

Provide a clear, concise mission statement.

Convey the intent of the commander.

Include annexes and appendixes, if required, to expand the information not readily incorporated
in earlier text, particularly with respect to hazard-specific instructions that may apply in a given
scenario.
C-7. The EMP format mirrors the FEMA CPG 101 emergency operations plan format, yet it is tailored to
meet the unique requirements of comprehensive military EM programs. The following are basic steps in
developing an EMP—

Form a collaborative planning team.

Understand the situation, including conducting research and analyzing the information. Gather
and compile the information developed during earlier installation planning processes, including
results of threat, vulnerability, and capability assessments and community profiles.

Determine goals and objectives. EMP development and documentation requires a comprehensive,
integrated approach and a strong, clear vision of EM program requirements.

Develop the plan. Produce a summary and basic plan. The plan summary provides the reader with
a concise synopsis of the scope and purpose of the plan. The basic plan provides the groundwork
for amplifying sections (annexes and appendixes), including SOPs and hazard-specific appendixes
(HSA). Commander guidance is developed in conjunction with the basic plan and is used to tailor
the language of the plan to meet the mission and goals of the commander. Develop and analyze
courses of action. Establish a plan of action and task suspense dates for the completion of the plan
and its annexes and appendixes. Identify resources. Determine and assign responsibility for
developing annexes and appendixes. Annexes provide the details not readily incorporated into the
basic plan, and they are written to increase the clarity and usefulness of the basic plan. These are
Emergency Management Plan (EMP) 
28 July 2021

C-3
only required if they are deemed necessary. Each annex relates to a specific aspect of the EM 
operation. Appendixes further expand the annexes and contain a more detailed explanation of the 
concept EM operations of the commander. Appendixes can be further subdivided into tabs and 
enclosures. The development and documentation of individual annexes and appendixes are tasked 
to EMWG members with related expertise or responsibility for the activity. For example, the 
public affairs representative supervises the development of the public affairs annex. 

Prepare, review, and gain approval of the plan.

Write the plan. Coordinate staff development and review of the plan. Each Service has published
guidance concerning deliberate planning, organization, and staff coordination (JP 5-0, Joint
Planning, NWP 5-01, Naval Operational Planning, AFI 10-2501, and MCWP 5-10, Marine Corps
Planning Process. Also plan, task, and publish the development of supporting plans. Each
subordinate and supporting commander who is assigned a task in the EMP may prepare a
supporting plan. Supporting plans are consistent with supporting commander missions and
responsibilities. Supporting plans are submitted to the supported commander for review and
approval.

Approve and disseminate the plan. Finalize the plan, and submit it through the staff and to the
commander for review and approval. The finalized plan is consistent with the organization or
installation mission and responsibilities; oriented on tactical perspective; adequately detailed to
provide specific actions to be taken; easily understood; and, if required, executed quickly and
decisively. After commander approval and upon execution, the EMP becomes an operation order.

Refine and execute the plan.

Exercise the plan, and evaluate its effectiveness. The EMP remains under constant review to
ensure it is truly a “living document,” incorporating lessons learned and best practices
identified in training, exercises, real-life events, and changes in risk management strategies.

Review, revise, and maintain the plan. When the EMP is published, the next planning cycle
begins. As preparation proceeds, assessments are continuously updated and may require
revisiting and revising the EMP. The EMP cannot remain static; rather, as the situation
changes, the plan also changes. The EMP is updated at least annually.
C-8. As part of the development of the EMP, resources identified by the installation are allocated to
prioritized requirements. The prioritization is made by the commander with input from the staff.
EMP FORMAT 
C-9. The cover instruction constitutes the legal authority, mission assignments, relevant EM policy
summary, and relevant role assignments and responsibilities associated with the EM program as determined
and signed by the installation commander. The target audience of the cover instruction is other commanders
above, equal to, and subordinate to the approving commander.
Note. According to FEMA and NIMS policy, there is no mandatory format for emergency 
operations plans. The following format provides a recommended structure based on the best 
practices among military and civilian EM planners. Unless otherwise directed by individual 
Services, installations are authorized to modify their plan formats to best suit the specific 
circumstances of the individual installation. 
C-10. The basic plan establishes the EM capabilities required to support the missions assigned by the cover
instruction. The basic plan establishes the prevention, protection, response, and recovery operational
concepts; and determines and details the linkage between the EMP and supporting or supported plans and
programs. The basic plan consists of at least the following sections—

Authorities and references.

Purpose, scope, applicability, and assumptions.

Implementation process.

Community profile (demographic, infrastructure, personnel categorization).


Risk management results summary (list of community awareness activities, mass warning
notification systems and procedures, personnel accountability procedures).

Response strategies and concepts (C2 of installation IC [ICS/NIMS]), SIP, evacuation procedures.

Recovery strategies and concepts (how will long- and short-term recovery be planned and
performed).

Mitigation strategies and activities (What mitigations are in place and how will they be activated?).

Continuity strategies and continuity programs (COOP/continuity of business policies and
procedures).

Plan management and maintenance efforts.

Supporting plans and programs, including the installation AT plan, the installation F&ES plan,
MTF plans and tenant command emergency action plans (EAP) (What interdependencies exist
and how do these plans support the overall EM program?).
C-11. Functional area annexes and ESFs are developed for each assigned functional area with responsibilities
in developing, fielding, employing, or sustaining EM capabilities. These annexes consist of detailed guidance
for each assigned functional area related to the development and execution of target EM capabilities. The
annexes assign responsibility to the organization and individuals for carrying out specific actions at projected
times and places in an emergency. These actions are not specific to a particular hazard, but rather focus on
core common components supported by the function itself.
C-12. ESFs are an operational level coordinating structure that Federal agencies use to organize an
interagency Federal response to an event. ESFs are mechanisms for grouping functions most frequently used
to provide Federal support in the management of disasters and incidents. Specific functional personnel are
assigned to lead or manage specific ESFs. These designated roles are referred to as ESF managers. Services
may use the ESF-based organizational model or a functional area-based organizational model for EM plans.
C-13. While neither NIMS nor DOD mandates the use of an ESF structure when a non-Federal entity is
coordinating an emergency under ICS, many state and local agencies use the ESF organization in their
response effort. Therefore, ESF information is provided here for SA to facilitate the interface between
installation and civilian response and recovery operations. An installation may choose to utilize an alternative
functional area or equivalent organizational structure in their approach to readiness and response. Examples
of responsibilities and manager roles for each ESF are shown in table C-1.
C-14. If using the functional area structure, EMPs include functional area annexes. These functional area
annexes assign responsibility to the organization and individuals for carrying out specific actions at projected
times and places in an emergency that exceeds the routine responsibility or capability of the functional area.
These actions are not specific to a particular hazard, but rather focus on core common components supported
by the functional area. Functional area annexes also identify unmet needs of each functional area that are
necessary for the successful execution of assigned functions.

Coordinates basic services such as communications supplies to assist local news media in information 
dissemination. 
C-15. HSAs are developed for each hazard identified in the risk management process. HSAs consist of
detailed guidance specific to the prevention of, response to, and recovery from identified hazards. In planning
for specific hazard operations, the installation can use the results of the vulnerability and risk assessment to
determine and emphasize the most relevant hazards to that installation. HSAs direct the employment of core
EM capabilities mandated in the basic plan in a specific sequence or manner to prevent, respond to, and
recover from a specific hazard. Duties and responsibilities of assigned functional areas for the management
of an emergency resulting from a specific hazard are summarized in each HSA.
C-16. The following list of possible hazard categories is outlined in DODI 6055.17—

Natural hazards (geological). Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, landslides, and mudslides,
avalanches.

Natural hazards (meteorological). Floods, storm surges, droughts, fire (forest, range, urban, wild
land, urban interface), snow, ice, hail, sleet, avalanches, windstorms, tropical cyclones, hurricanes,
tornadoes, water spouts, dust or sand storms, extreme temperatures (heat and cold), lightning
strikes, and geomagnetic storms.

Natural hazards (biological). Diseases that impact humans or animals (plague, anthrax, West Nile
virus, foot and mouth disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome/COVID-19, pandemic diseases
and virulent hemorrhagic fevers – Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Yellow, Rift Valley, Hantavirus).

Human-caused events (incidental). HAZMAT (explosive, flammable liquid, flammable gas,
flammable solid, oxidizer, poison, radiological, and corrosive) spill or release; explosion or fire;
transportation accident; building or structure collapse; energy, power, or utility failure; fuel or
resource shortage; air or water pollution or contamination; dam, levee, or other water control
structure failure; financial issues (economic depression, inflation, and financial system collapse);
communication system interruption; and misinformation.

Human-caused events (intentional). Terrorism (CBRNE and cyber), sabotage, civil disturbance,
public unrest, mass hysteria, riot, enemy attack, war, insurrection, strike or labor dispute,
disinformation, criminal activity (vandalism, arson, theft, fraud, embezzlement, and data theft),
electromagnetic pulse, physical or information security breach, active shooter, product defect or
contamination.

Technologically caused events. Central computer, mainframe, software, or application (internal
and external); ancillary support equipment; telecommunications; and energy (power or utility).
C-17. The decision to develop an HSA for an EMP is based on special planning requirements not common
to other hazards addressed within the plan and on regulatory considerations that may require extensive,
detailed planning. The content of an HSA focuses on the special planning needs generated by the hazard and
does not duplicate the information in the larger plan.
C-18. The HSA contains unique and regulatory response planning details that apply to a single hazard. It
addresses the essential operational actions that must be accomplished to facilitate the successful completion
of a particular response function. As appropriate, the HSA quantifies the risk area, geography, and
demography considerations that apply to the hazard.
C-19. While the nature of each HSA will be highly dependent on elements unique to each installation, some
operational commonalities exist for each individual hazard. Excellent guidance on response operations for
specific hazards is available from the FEMA website. Although these incident annexes were written for a
Emergency Management Plan (EMP) 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
C-11
civilian government response effort, much of the content of these incident annexes can be used to frame the 
development of HSAs for inclusion into a DOD EMP. The following incident annexes are currently available 
from the various Web sites listed below— 

Biological incidents:
https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_incident-annex_biological.pdf.

Catastrophic incidents:

annex_nuclear-radiological.pdf.

Cyberspace incidents:  https://www.fema.gov/pdf/government/grant/hsgp/fy09_hsgp_cyber.pdf.
C-20. Further detail on the development of HSAs can be found in chapter 6 of the FEMA CPG 101, which
is a guide to assist state and local governments in all-hazards emergency operations planning. Elements of
this guidance have to be reconstructed to apply to the installation instead of to a civilian government structure; 
however, the basic principles of hazard-specific planning still apply at the installation level. Each Service
EM program should develop templates and checklists for hazard-specific events that pertain for each Service
installation.
C-21. Support annexes add specific information and direction to the emergency operations plan. Support
annexes focus on critical operational functions and who is responsible for carrying them out. These annexes
clearly describe the policies, processes, roles, and responsibilities agencies and departments carry out before,
during, and after an emergency. While the basic plan provides broad, overarching information, these annexes
focus on specific responsibilities, tasks, and operational actions that pertain to the performance of a particular
emergency operations function.
C-22. These annexes also establish targets for preparedness (training, exercises, equipment checks,
maintenance) that facilitate achieving function-related goals and objectives during emergencies and disasters.
This list of emergency response functions is not exhaustive or comprehensive. Each jurisdiction assesses its
own needs, and additional or different annexes are prepared at the discretion of the planning team.
C-23. General appendixes are the last section of the EM plan. They include basic elements, such as definitions
and acronyms (see table C-2).

D-1
Appendix D 
Response Operations and Emergency Operations Centers 
(EOC) 
The response phase of an incident is usually the most energy-intensive of all phases; 
manpower, infrastructure, and resources are sustained on a 24-hour cycle from the 
moment an incident is triggered until the incident is brought under control and recovery 
begins. Response activities are managed by the IC on-scene, while support to the 
response is managed and coordinated by the EOC for the duration of the response. 
These activities are governed by the ICS process and principles. 
INCIDENT TRIGGERS 
D-1. An initial incident or series of incidents results in a trigger that sets a series of response actions in
motion. The type of trigger will depend on whether it is associated with a warning or no-warning incident,
sometimes referred to as notice or no-notice incidents. Examples of warning incidents include, but are not
limited to, hurricanes and other predictable natural hazards or pandemic disease. Examples of no-warning
incidents include, but are not limited to, earthquakes, flash floods, HAZMAT spills or releases, and terrorist
attacks. Triggers also depend on the speed of event onset, with incidents such as chemical spills considered
immediate onset and incidents such as disease outbreaks considered slow onset.
D-2. Triggers may be the result of a natural hazard or a signal received from deployed detection equipment,
medical surveillance information, occupational and environmental health information, visual observance,
and/or intelligence analysis. The types of detection technologies deployed at installations may vary; however,
installations have access to—

Intelligence sharing and dissemination. Installations identify multiple intelligence sources within
and outside the DOD (including those that can be obtained through an open source) and establish
the degree to which information sharing is allowable with EM organizations outside the DOD.
These sources may include natural hazards warning systems available within the community or
information gathered with specialized CBRN and explosive detector/surveillance technology, as
available on the installation.

Health threat surveillance and detection. The medical official or designee identifies medical and
public health/preventive medicine information needed, ensures medical laboratory support to
confirm and identify hazardous substances in the affected environment, integrates and monitors
medical surveillance systems operations, integrates and monitors occupational and environmental
health surveillance systems operations, and monitors the health status of essential personnel and
the general population.

Medical information. The public health or medical functional area designee collects information
from available medical sources, provides medical information to local organizations and private-
sector partners, and works to sustain information gathering activities necessary for assessing
emerging health threat information during an incident.
COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) 
D-3. During an incident, C2 is implemented through the ICS. C2 may be implemented using an EOC and/or
a mobile command center as a central command location.
Appendix D 
D-2
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM (ICS) 
D-4. The ICS provides its users with an integrated organizational structure to match the complexities and
demands of single or multiple incidents without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. The resulting
UC not only coordinates the efforts of many jurisdictions, but also provides for and assures joint decisions
on objectives, strategies, plans, priorities, and public communications.
D-5. The NIMS requires ICS use for responses and specifies that all levels of government must adopt the
ICS. It is used across the range of incidents, from small to complex and from natural to manmade, including
acts of catastrophic terrorism. The ICS may be expanded to include a UC for complex responses that require
multiagency and/or multijurisdictional resources.
D-6. The ICS is based on proven management principles, which contribute to the strength and efficiency of
the overall system used to implement a response action according to the execution tasks outlined in the EM
plan. The ICS principles are implemented through a wide range of management features, including the use
of common terminology, clear text, and a modular organizational structure. The ICS emphasizes effective
planning, including management by objectives and reliance on an IAP.
D-7. The principal ICS management functions include—

Command. The IC is responsible for incident or event activity. Although other functions may be
left unfilled, there will always be an IC. The IC may also have a command staff made of:

Public Information Officer.

Safety Officer.

Liaison Officer.

Operations. The operations section is responsible for directing the tactical actions to meet incident
objectives.

Planning. The planning section is responsible for collecting, evaluating, and displaying incident
information; maintaining the status of resources; and preparing the IAP and incident-related
documentation.

Logistics. The logistics section is responsible for providing adequate services and support to meet
incident or event needs.

Finance/administration. The finance/administration section is responsible for keeping track of
incident-related costs and personnel and equipment records and for administering procurement
contracts associated with the incident or event.
Note. Each functional area can be expanded as needed into additional organizational units with 
further delegation of authority. 
D-8. Because the ICS allows for organizational flexibility, an intelligence/investigation function can be
embedded in several different places within the organizational structure—

Within the planning section. This is the traditional placement for the intelligence/investigation
function and is appropriate for incidents with little or no investigative information requirements
or a significant amount of specialized information.

As a separate general staff section. This may be appropriate when there is an
intelligence/investigative component to the incident or when multiple investigative agencies are
part of the investigative process and/or there is a need for classified intelligence.

Within the operations section. This may be appropriate for incidents that require a high degree of
linkage and coordination between the investigative information and the operational tactics that are
being employed.

Within the command staff. This may be appropriate for incidents with little need for tactical
information or classified intelligence and where supporting agency representatives provide real- 
time information to the command element.
Response Operations and Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
D-3
D-9. The modular organization of the ICS allows responders to scale their efforts and apply the parts of the
ICS structure that best meet the demands of the incident. There are no hard-and-fast rules for when or how
to expand the ICS organization.
D-10. Many incidents never require the activation of planning, logistics, or finance/administration sections,
while others require some or all of them to be established. A major advantage of the ICS organization is the
ability to fill only those parts of the organization that are required. However, if there is a need to expand the
organization, additional positions exist within the ICS framework to meet virtually any need. For example,
in operations involving responders from a single jurisdiction, the ICS establishes an organization for
comprehensive response management. However, when an incident involves more than one agency or
jurisdiction, responders can expand the ICS framework to address a multijurisdictional incident.
D-11. An IAP is an oral or written plan communicating the overall incident objectives in the context of
operational and support activities for managing an incident. The creation of an IAP is critical to identifying
operational resources and assignments and allows for management by objectives established in the IAP
process. Every incident has a verbal or written IAP; however, written IAPs are highly recommended and are
required for hazardous materials incidents. At the simplest level, IAPs have four elements—

What do we want to do?

Who is responsible for doing it?

How do we communicate with each other?

What is the procedure if someone is injured?
D-12. The IAP process allows for functional organization and management by objectives in the response
effort. The process consists of the following steps—

Step 1. Understand installation, component, and Service policy and direction.

Step 2. Assess the incident, and maintain SA.

Step 3. Establish incident objectives (see the IAP).

Step 4. Select appropriate strategies to achieve objectives.

Step 5. Perform tactical direction, and assign and monitor resources.

Step 6. Provide a follow-up and iterative reevaluation of the process.
D-13. The operational period defines the complete planning cycle. A planning cycle is typically established
by the IC and planning section chief, and an IAP is then developed by the planning section for the next
operational period (usually 12 or 24 hours in length) and submitted to the IC for approval. The creation of a
planning cycle and the development of an IAP for a particular operational period helps to focus the available
resources on the highest priorities/incident objectives. The planning cycle, if properly practiced, brings
together input and identifies critical shortfalls that need to be addressed to carry out IC objectives for that
period.
D-14. The UC is an ICS management process which allows all agencies who have jurisdictional or functional
responsibility for the incident to jointly develop a common set of incident objectives and strategies. This is
accomplished without losing or giving up agency authority, responsibility, or accountability. The UC is an
important feature of ICS. It allows agencies having a legitimate responsibility at an incident to be a part of
the incident command function.
D-15. During the emergency response effort, the transfer of command and/or responsibility may occur several
times as the scope of the emergency shifts or as an operational period begins or ends. During such transfers,
all replacements are briefed on actions taken, actions needed, and the general status of the operation. Civilian
officials are kept informed through introductions to new incoming members of the key workforce.
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER (EOC) 
D-16. An EOC is the focal point of operations for the support of the IC and those responders at the incident
site. The EOC is the location where the coordination of information and resources in support of the incident
take place. The EOC is normally located in a permanent facility within the installation; however, an alternate
or temporary location may be utilized when the primary location is unusable.
Appendix D 
D-4
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
D-17. Installation commanders, or their designees, activate the EOC to manage incident response resources.
The installation commander provides guidance to the EOC on mission priorities through such vehicles as
Commander’s Intent and CCIRs. The installation commander approves, directs, or ensures IC or EOC
requests for assistance from external specialized teams are forwarded through the higher headquarters
component or DOD component commanders. During an incident, the EOC considers the following initial
response actions—

EOC assembly. Based on the magnitude of the incident, the EOC is recalled as the full EOC or
tailored to include only those staff members and ESFs (or designated functional area equivalents)
required to handle the incident. When there is doubt, it is easier to recall the full EOC staff and
subsequently dismiss those members not required.

EOC activation. The EOC is activated by the installation commander or his/her designee. The
EOC updates the CAT with incident status reports. The EOC is comprised of ESFs (or designated
functional area equivalents) and other functional agency representation as needed. Depending on
the complexity and size of an event, the EOC may be activated to manage the operations needed
to support contingencies. The EOC coordinates with the IC, civilian EOCs, EOD, F&ES,
communications centers, and medical services.

Level 3: Normal Operations/Steady-state:  Activities that are normal for the center, when no
incident or specific risk or hazard has been identified, are underway. This includes routine watch
and warning activities if the center normally houses this function.

Level 2: Enhanced Steady State/Partial Activation:  Certain EOC Team members/ organizations
are activated to monitor a credible threat, risk or hazard and/or to support the response to a new
and potentially evolving incident.

Level 1: Full activation. Full activation is recalling all the members of the EOC, all ESF/functional
area offices of primary responsibility, and supporting participants. A major incident and its
subsequent recovery require the full EOC. Alternatively, full activation may be followed by a
situation briefing and a shift to partial activation.
D-18. The EOC provides oversight for the installation commander to support and control emergency or
contingency incidents. The EOC can support multiple ICs simultaneously, while providing strategic senior
officer level C2 for sustained response and recovery operations. The EOC is responsible for directing the
ESFs or functional areas. Once the EOC staff is operating, they coordinate responsive information and
resources that the IC needs to respond to the incident. In addition, the EOC provides the IC, through the
ESFs/functional areas, the support required to control the incident, restore mission capabilities, and sustain
response and recovery activities. The EOC keeps the installation commander fully informed on the incident
response efforts throughout the operation. The EOC establishes and maintains an accurate and timely SA. It
is the responsibility of the EOC to ensure the entire staff is populating current incident information through
the installation COP.
MOBILE COMMAND CENTER 
D-19. Mobile command centers provide for continuous C2 capability during periods when the primary or
alternate EOC will not be in operation, such as when emergency teams are transferring between a primary
and alternate EOC. The mobile command center also provides the capability to provide C2 for localized field
operations.
D-20. EM programs may consider incorporating a mobile command center into their response capabilities.
The mobile command center provides both operations and communications capability, which may be divided
into separate vehicles that travel together.
D-21. The mobile command center should be equipped with basic communications equipment to provide
similar support as the primary EOC. It is of sufficient size to accommodate the equipment and the primary
team members and commanders. The equipment on the mobile command center should be interoperable with
any communication equipment used by responders.
D-22. The mobile command center is maintained in a complete state of readiness. It is self-propelled or
transportable without special equipment and capable of traveling over public roadways, including
unimproved roadway surfaces.

Appendix E 
Communications 
The topic of communications can mean many different things with respect to EM. 
Communications may include information management in the formation and 
maintenance of a COP, interoperable communication standards and equipment, mass 
warning and notification systems, or EPI. But one thing is certain—well-planned, fully 
coordinated, interoperable, timely and accurate communication that takes place 
consistently throughout the EM process can help to ensure effective planning, 
response, recovery, and mitigation. 
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 
E-1. Information management is an important element in supporting a COP. Effective EM and incident
response activities rely on flexible communications and information systems that provide a COP to
command/EM/response personnel and their affiliated organizations. Establishing and maintaining a COP and
ensuring accessibility and interoperability are the principal goals of the communications and information
management component of NIMS. Properly planned, established, and applied communications enable the
dissemination of information among command and support elements and, as appropriate, cooperating
agencies and organizations.
E-2. The EM program ensures information technology requirements are addressed for all appropriate
entities, including mass warning and notification systems, continuity plans, installation dispatch center,
installation EOC, predesignated mass care locations, and other preidentified locations applicable to the
execution of the EMP.
E-3. All entities involved in managing an incident use common terminology for communications as outlined 
in NIMS. This allows diverse operational, management, and support entities to work together across a wide
variety of incident management functions. Standard common terminology is a key principle of NIMS;
therefore, it is important to limit the unnecessary creation of terminology.
E-4. The EM programs strive for interoperability with local civil jurisdictions and other military Services
in the vicinity of the installation. Interoperability includes the technical exchange of information and the end-
to-end operational effectiveness of that exchange of information as required for mission accomplishment.
The EM interoperability is more than just information exchange, as it includes systems, processes,
procedures, organizations, and missions over the life cycle and is balanced with information assurance.
MASS WARNING NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEMS 
E-5. Executive Order 13407 requires the U.S. to have an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and
comprehensive system to alert and warn the American people in times of emergency. Various Federal entities,
ranging from FEMA to the National Weather Service and the CDC, as well as Air Force and Navy Service
Meteorological and Oceanographic agencies have established programs, standards, and funding mechanisms
to ensure alert and warning systems are sustained and interoperable at the Federal, state, and local levels. The
goal of a national mass notification effort is for citizens to receive rapid, secure, and trustworthy messages
in times of emergency.
E-6. Military installations are also required to provide mass warning notification to their protected
population. DODI 6055.17, the report of the DOD Independent Review (Protecting the Force:  Lessons from
Fort Hood), and the resulting Secretary of Defense memo (Final Recommendations of the Fort Hood Follow-
on Review) require installations to field a mass warning notification system capability and to exercise the
system at a minimum twice a year, in order to achieve full operational capability.
Appendix E 
E-2
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
E-7. Mass warning notification systems serve a variety of functions on and off an installation—

FP and other population protection; mass dissemination of alerts to accelerate community action
and response.

Personnel recall; rapid activation of off-base personnel to report for duty.

Personnel accountability; proactive assessment of force status and its ability to perform duties.
E-8. Installations are likely to have multiple redundant systems to maximize the potential for reaching all
personnel—

Networked computers; delivery of audiovisual notifications to personal computers connected to
the internet protocol network.

Telephone; delivery of alerts as audio messages to any phone, sometimes called “Reverse 9-1-1.”

Text messaging; delivery of text messages and/or e-mail to mobile phones, pagers, smartphones,
or fax machines.

Indoor and outdoor speakers; audio notifications via sirens and the activation of indoor and
outdoor emergency warning and mass notification systems.

Cable television and display boards; text alerts to digital displays.

Radio broadcasts; audio broadcasts to local radio stations.

National Emergency Alert System; delivery of text-based alerts via common alerting protocol to
the National Public Alert System.

Residential route alerting; messages announced to neighborhoods from vehicles equipped with
public address systems.
E-9. Installations with significant on-base or nearby off-base family housing cooperate with local
authorities for access to radio and television emergency communication systems. Overseas, a mass warning
notification system includes warning sponsored family members living off base, ideally by the integration
with local or HN systems.
E-10. Mass warning notification systems are most effective when notices and messages can be developed in
advance of an incident, vetted through the appropriate channels, and placed on standby until needed. In this
way, the installation can identify diverse populations and their communications needs and tailor messages to
fit them under a variety of circumstances. This preevent message development significantly shortens the lag
time between an event and the notification of the population.
INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS 
E-11. The NRF describes how communities, tribes, states, the Federal government, and private sector and
nongovernmental partners work together to coordinate national response. An integral part of this multisector
coordination is interoperable communications.
E-12. The land mobile radio system (LMRS) is a nontactical radio frequency system that supports installation
FP, public safety, and EM entities. LMRSs have the capability to interconnect with state and local counterpart
mobile radio networks to foster interdependencies and interoperability with civilian jurisdictions during
incident response. The Association of Public Safety Communications Project 25 (APCO-25), also known as
Project 25 or P25, is a two-way, digital LMRS technology suite of standards for use by Federal,
state/province, and local public safety agencies in North America to enable them to communicate with other
agencies and mutual aid response teams in emergencies. This standard has not yet been implemented in all
localities; however, installations ensure that newly purchased communications assets are compliant for future
capability. The National Emergency Communications Plan and the Federal Communications Commission
have identified interoperable frequencies for public safety radio bands, and these are programmed within
LMRS units whenever possible.
E-13. Long-term evolution (LTE) is the preferred broadband technology platform for a common air interface
established by the Federal Communications Commission for 700 Megahertz public safety broadband
networks to create a foundation for wireless interoperability and provide a clear path for the deployment and
evolution of a nationwide interoperable public safety broadband network. LTE has the potential to handle
voice and data communications. Public safety broadband network providers are required to submit
certification their networks support required LTE interfaces.
Communications 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
E-3
E-14. Some communications technologies offer the ability to fully integrate LTE and APCO-25 standards
within one system. Additional telecommunications considerations for interoperability may include base
telephone infrastructure, multiplexers, switches, routers, optical fiber, and personal computers with standard
software configured for local area networks and wide area networks, and installation incident command
vehicles. The First Responder Network Authority (https://FirstNet.gov) is an independent authority within
the U.S. Department of Commerce. FirstNet’s mission is to ensure the building, deployment, and operation
of the nationwide broadband network that equips first responders to save lives and protect U.S. communities.
FirstNet provides a reliable, resilient, highly available wireless connection for emergency response. Priority
and preemption capabilities are always on, not externally activated. This ensures first responders stay
connected during large emergencies when commercial networks can become overwhelmed. FirstNet's
priority capabilities have been battle-tested by public safety during natural disasters, emergency incidents,
and preplanned events. With FirstNet, the agency can—

Provide prioritized connectivity for disaster response and recovery operations with the ability to
preempt commercial traffic on the network.

Stream high-volume data to and from the EOC to maintain situational awareness and a common
operating picture.

Track vehicles, equipment, personnel, and evacuees with greater speed and accuracy.

Utilize public safety and emergency management apps via the FirstNet App Catalog.

Integrate with Next Generation 9-1-1 and Smart Cities applications.
EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION (EPI) 
E-15. The EPI is based on the integration of complementary crisis communication and risk communication
theories and techniques. In this context, crisis communication is the ability to communicate effectively with
other government agencies, the media, and the general public by delivering accurate and timely information
that is designed to inform, educate, and guide the public in any necessary response actions they need to take
to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. A recommendation to SIP is an example of crisis
communication. Example templates for crisis communications such as radio scripts and social media posts
can be found in the Communications Toolkit located on the fema.gov website.
E-16. In concert with crisis communication, risk communication is an interactive process, not an event. The
risk communication process facilitates the exchange of information and opinion (real or perceived) among
individuals, groups, or institutions. Risk communication is proactive and engages with stakeholders about
their issues and concerns in order to communicate the complexities and uncertainties of risk. Risk
communication efforts are the foundation of an effective EPI program during all mission areas of EM. Many
Federal agencies are currently teaching, training, and implementing EPI practices based on this combination
of crisis and risk communication principles.
E-17. In some cases, the foundational EPI principles listed below may run counter to many instinctive
practices. It is human nature to wait until we know everything we can before releasing information in an
attempt to allay fear and reduce the potential for panic. The principles provided below balance these instincts
with behavioral principles that govern how people receive and process information. For example, we know
panic is actually more likely to occur in the absence of information. We also know, in general, people perform 
at their best under crisis conditions and the public must have trust and confidence in the response. We also
know the media is a primary means for communicating with the public. Given that background, the eight
basic EPI principles are described below—

Be proactive; communicate before, during, and after an emergency. The best time to plan for EPI
and build working relationships with other government agencies, the media, and citizens, is before
the stress and strain of a response. Plan to communicate with the potentially affected public by
engaging them in determining:

What information will be needed before, during, and after an emergency?

Who will need to be informed and how?

What are the opportunities for effective information exchange, and how can they be
maximized?

What are the obstacles for effective information exchange, and how can they be overcome?

E-4
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 

What questions can be anticipated?

How can the needs of the news media be met?

What message does higher headquarters want to convey?

Take the high ground in an emergency. The first messages are the most important. Get accurate
messages out quickly. Keep it simple. Be consistent. Build trust and confidence by expressing
empathy and caring, competence and expertise, honesty and openness, and commitment and
dedication.

Craft messages carefully. Follow the public information protocols to verify and approve messages,
and then promptly release messages to the public. Stay on message. Avoid jargon. Be careful with
risk comparisons. Recognize the information needs of different audiences.

Trust people to do the right thing. People often perform best under the most trying circumstances.
Do not focus on alleviating panic. Acknowledge uncertainty. Do not over-reassure. Tell the truth.
Deal with rumors.

Give the public things to do. Give people guidance on how they need to respond.

Select the right spokespersons. Effective spokespersons are trained, comfortable with their role,
familiar, and credible.

Form positive relationships with the media. Recognize the media as a primary source of public
information. Understand and meet their needs for information.

Be prepared to answer questions. Anticipate questions and prepare. Stay on message. Be honest
and accurate. Provide accurate follow-up information promptly. Do not improvise, speculate, or
say “no comment.”

Be prepared to say, “I do not know.” You will not know all of the answers to the questions. Have
someone write down questions for which information is not available to answer and offer to
provide an answer at the next news conference or to that person when the information becomes
available.

Resource Management 
Resource management involves coordinating and overseeing the application of tools, 
processes, and systems that provide incident management personnel with timely and 
appropriate resources during an incident. Resources may include personnel, teams, 
information, expert knowledge, facilities, technology, equipment, supplies, specialized 
training, and funding (financial resources). Resource management takes place at all 
levels in support of the incident management activities at the installation EOC, dispatch 
center, ICP, and related incident management nodes. To implement these concepts and 
principles in performing the primary tasks of resource management, the EM program 
includes standardized procedures, methodologies, and functions in its resource 
management processes. These processes reflect functional considerations, geographic 
factors, and validated practices within and across disciplines and are continually 
adjusted as new lessons are learned. 
PRINCIPLES 
F-1. Each EM program employs NIMS-based resource management procedures to prioritize resource
allocation at the installation level. NIMS resource management consists of four primary tasks, which
include—

Establishing systems for describing, inventorying, requesting, and tracking resources.

Activating these systems prior to and during an incident.

Dispatching resources prior to and during an incident.

Deactivating, recalling, or demobilizing resources during or after an incident.
F-2. The NIMS principles of resource management are—

Advance planning. Preparedness organizations work together in advance of an incident to develop
plans for managing and employing resources in a variety of possible emergency circumstances.

Resource identification and ordering. Resource managers use standardized processes and
methodologies to order, identify, mobilize, dispatch, and track the resources required to support
incident management activities. Resource managers perform these tasks either at an IC’s request
or according to planning requirements.

Resources organization. Resources are categorized by size, capacity, capability, skill, and other
characteristics. This makes the resource ordering and dispatch process within jurisdictions, across
jurisdictions, and between governmental and nongovernmental entities more efficient and ensures
ICs receive resources appropriate to their needs.

Support agreements. Preincident support agreements among all parties providing or requesting
resources are necessary to enable effective and efficient resource management during incident
operations. Formal preincident agreements between parties, governmental and nongovernmental,
that might provide or request resources are established to ensure the employment of standardized,
interoperable equipment and other incident resources during incident operations.

Personnel certification and credentialing. Personnel certification entails authoritatively attesting
individuals meet professional standards for the training, experience, and performance required for
key incident management functions. Credentialing involves providing documentation that can
authenticate and validate the certification and identity of designated incident managers and
emergency responders. This system helps ensure personnel representing various jurisdictional
levels and functional disciplines possess a minimum common level of training, currency,

experience, physical and medical fitness, and capability for the incident management or 
emergency responder positions that they are tasked to fill. 

Equipment interoperability. Ensure, when possible, emergency response equipment is
interoperable with equipment used by mutual aid partners in local communities.
F-3. Resource management includes identifying the quantity, quality, capabilities, limitations, cost, and
liability connected with each resource and the timeframe within which each resource is required. This concept
of resource management provides a uniform method of identifying, acquiring, allocating, and tracking
resources and increases the effective use of support agreements, mutual aid, volunteer assistance, and
donations through the standard classification and sharing of kinds and types of resources required for incident
management.
F-4. The resource management process can be separated into two parts; resource management as an element
of preparedness and resource management during an incident. The preparedness activities (resource typing,
credentialing, and inventorying) are conducted on a continual basis to help ensure resources are ready to be
mobilized when called to an incident. Resource management during an incident is a finite process, specific
to the needs of the particular incident that includes identifying requirements, ordering and acquiring,
mobilizing, tracking and reporting, recovering and demobilizing, and reimbursing.
RESOURCE TYPING 
F-5. As outlined in NIMS, resource typing entails categorizing (by capability) the resources incident
managers commonly request, deploy, and employ. Measurable standards identifying the capabilities and
performance levels of resources serve as the basis for categories. Resource users at all levels identify these
standards and then type resources on a consensus basis, with a national level entity taking the coordinating
lead. Resource kinds may be divided into subcategories (types) to more precisely define the resource
capabilities needed to meet specific requirements. Resource typing is a continuous process designed to be as
simple as possible to facilitate frequent use and accuracy in obtaining needed resources (see NIMS for
additional details). To allow resources to be deployed and used on a national basis, the National Integration
Center is responsible for defining national resource typing standards—
Note. The Tier One and Tier Two assets discussed below are terms established by DHS and FEMA 
for resource typing. There is no correlation or linkage between these asset/resource descriptions 
and the installation Tier Designations 2, 1, and 0 established by the Joint Program Manager 
Installation Protection Program for the purposes of equipment fielding. NIMS resources will be 
listed throughout this publication with designation of Tier One and Tier Two for delineation.  

National NIMS Tier One Assets. To allow resources to be deployed and used on a national basis,
the National Integration Center is responsible for defining national resource typing standards for
NIMS Tier One assets (national level resources). NIMS Tier One assets have strict requirements
regarding organization, manning, training, certification, credentialing, equipment, and past
experience with Federal/state disaster declarations. Past DSCA operations do not count for
previous experience. All installation capabilities are retained under DOD control and are not
nationally deployed by FEMA independent of DSCA mission assignments. Therefore, under
ordinary circumstances it is likely that none of the available NIMS Tier One resource definitions
are applicable to installations.

State and Local NIMS Tier Two Assets. NIMS Tier Two assets are those resources defined and
inventoried by local jurisdictions, including EM programs, that are not Tier One resources and are
not assigned to interstate mutual aid deployment under EM assistance compacts. This definition
includes all identified EM program resources. EM programs comply with NIMS requirements by
developing standardized resource typing definitions for local EM programs to the extent possible.
Installations type all resources identified within their jurisdiction or with which they have an
approved support agreement or contract. Installations may develop local typing criteria for
additional NIMS Tier Two assets identified in the planning process.
F-6. If a requester is unable to describe an item by resource type or classification system, those with resource 
management responsibilities provide technical advice to enable the requirements to be defined and translated

H-1
Appendix H 
Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown 
Under certain conditions, it may become necessary to protect the population from 
imminent hazards during an incident. The installation commander decides the best 
method for this measure based on the conditions of the incident; for example, the nature 
of the hazard, the environmental conditions, or the amount of time before an incident 
will occur (in the case of notice events). The three options available to the installation 
commander for geographically protecting the installation populous are evacuation, SIP, 
and lockdown. Once an installation commander institutes an order for evacuation, SIP, 
or lockdown, a personnel accountability program is executed to keep track of all 
personnel through the duration of the event. 
EVACUATION 
H-1. Evacuation removes a population at risk from the hazard(s) at hand and; therefore, significantly
decreases the scope, scale, and impact of any emergency. During an evacuation, an endangered population is
directed to use specified evacuation routes and transportation methods to depart a threatened area/location.
The safe evacuation of threatened populations when endangered by a catastrophic event is one of the principal 
reasons for developing an EMP.
EVACUATION MANAGEMENT 
H-2. Evacuation management is the capability to direct and manage the evacuation of personnel and/or
community members and animals to a local safe haven on the installation, a civilian shelter provided by one
or more civil jurisdictions, or a predesignated, geographically remote installation or location. Evacuation
management includes the phased or simultaneous return of evacuees to on-post residences or businesses
during the recovery phase.
H-3. Evacuation management also includes continuous communication to evacuees during the entire
evacuation process, throughout mass care operations, and during the return of evacuees to their residences or
workplaces on the installation. EM programs may consider the establishment of an evacuation management
team to coordinate the evacuation of personnel, their families, and animals to a shelter, safe haven, or other
designated location.
EVACUATION PLANNING 
H-4. The evacuation planning process includes identifying the available transportation networks and the
capabilities and limitations of each of these transportation methods, especially the carrying capacity of
proposed evacuation routes and existing or potential traffic bottlenecks or blockages caused by traffic
congestion or natural occurrences, such as rising waters. It is important to keep in mind destructive weather
and seismic events may limit or completely eliminate some transportation methods, especially bridges,
ferries, tunnels, and some mass transit systems.
H-5. Demographic information collected during the planning phase is integral to coordinating and executing 
an effective evacuation effort. Prior knowledge of the population, their locations, and their resource needs
(for example, vulnerable populations may lack transportation or the ability to receive information through
common lines of communication) is pivotal in determining the nature and magnitude of the evacuation
assistance needed.
Appendix H 
H-2
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
H-6. In addition, if efforts during the preparedness phase to build a resilient and well-informed community
are successful, much of the protected population may be able to orchestrate a relatively efficient self-
evacuation when there is sufficient notice of the event. Self-evacuating community members still need the
benefit of full communication efforts on the nature of the risk and the best methods for evacuation (routes,
safe haven locations, resources). They also require some assistance with infrastructure preparedness, such as
the contraflow of roads and highways, debris removal, and notification of any bridge or tunnel closures due
to high winds, flooding, or other incidents.
H-7. The evaluation of available evacuation routes is a key component of evacuation planning and directly
impacts the clearance time of an installation or evacuation zone within an installation. Evacuation planning
entails establishing primary and secondary evacuation routes and having these routes clearly marked and well
lit. Evacuation routes include the preevent fielding of evacuation route markers/signs, which can be easily
read during an emergency (low-light conditions, rain/ash fall conditions).
H-8. The designation of evacuation routes is closely coordinated with the state/local evacuation plan to
mitigate conflicting routes. Note the installation population may not have been considered during the
development of the state/local evacuation plan and analysis of clearance times. The determination of
evacuation routes is also closely coordinated with the Department of Public Works and synchronized with
published preincident plans so families and individuals can use that information in developing their family
or individual preparedness plans.
H-9. In determining potential evacuation routes, consider the following—

The road capacity/load.

Sufficient width to accommodate the number of evacuating personnel.

The route is clear and unobstructed at all times.

The route is unlikely to expose evacuating personnel to additional hazards.

Services along the route such as fuel, food, lodging (hotels, remote safe havens/shelters).

Does the road lead to or contain a bridge, tunnel, or flood zone? This may have an impact on
clearance time, especially for certain types of vehicles (for example, travel trailers, campers, motor
homes, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles).

Evacuation routes can also include waterways, railroads, and airfields, depending on the
availability of boats, trains, and airplanes/helicopters, respectively.

Use of reverse laning and contraflow (authorized/directed change of traffic pattern) to increase the
load of a given route. Challenges to contraflow include increased signage, increased manpower
for control, and acceptable entrance and exit points.
H-10. Evacuation may require extensive coordination with multimodal transportation assets, including DOD,
private, or state/local/Federal providers. Transportation assets can come in many forms and from many
sources. A large portion of an installation population may not have access to transportation and would need
transportation assistance. Examples of potential transportation assets include the following—

Personal vehicles (cars, sport utility vehicles, travel trailers, campers, motor homes, motorcycles,
bicycles, and boats).

Motor pool assets.

Mass transit (buses, rail).

Ferries.

Air assets.

Port assets.

National Guard transportation assets.
H-11. Each type of transportation asset may have limitations, depending on the hazard. These limitations are
considered in planning evacuation and determining clearance time. The use of some or all of these
transportation methods during certain emergencies; especially those involving flooding, high winds, multiple
aftershocks, or volcanic eruption, may be unadvisable and result in blocking the progress of the evacuation.
For example, buses are subject to driving restrictions over bridges during high winds. During a hurricane
evacuation, with wind speeds increasing over time, evacuation plans do not rely on buses or other large
Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
H-3
transport vehicles crossing bridges after a certain point in the progression of the hurricane system toward the 
area. EPI broadcasts include any prohibitions on the use of these transportation methods. 
H-12. Evacuation (vulnerability) zones provide a foundation to model traffic movements from one
geographic area to another. It is necessary to include storm surge modeling in the development of the
evacuation zones and to revise these zone models as information changes or is refined based on exercises or
real events. Evacuation zones are designed to meet several functions; for example—

They reflect the areas in each storm scenario which will need to be evacuated due to storm surge
inundation.

They relate as closely as possible to available population data information.

The location and vulnerability of evacuation zones are clearly defined for the protected population
to promote efficient evacuation.
EVACUATION OPERATIONS 
H-13. The timely issuance of evacuation orders directly affects the successful evacuation of all designated
personnel. In determining the proper timeframe to issue evacuation orders, consider the weather, traffic,
shelter, geographic, and political conditions at the evacuation sites, on the designated evacuation route(s),
and at the receiving relocation site(s). Preevent evacuation route management with Federal, state, local, other
Service, and/or private agencies and the preevent designation of relocation site(s) and coordination with
external shelter and safe haven providers play a critical role in the management of evacuation operations. For
events with adequate warning, evacuation orders are issued when school is not in session and when there are
at least eight hours of daylight included in the evacuation time allowed. For more information on evacuation
plans and operations, see the Department of Transportation/Federal Highway Administration primer on
Using Highways During Evacuation Operations for Events With Advance Notice.
H-14. There are two main types of evacuation orders, and the determination of which order to issue is based
on the severity of the hazard, the risk to the population, and the criticality of personnel to the EM effort—

Mandatory evacuation. This is an ordered, nonelective evacuation. Designated mission-critical
personnel are exempt from evacuation orders as required.

Voluntary evacuation. When danger to personnel is remote, but the loss of services is possible, a
voluntary evacuation may be authorized. Designated mission-critical and mission-essential
personnel may be required/requested to remain on base for emergency response and recovery.
H-15. In the event of an evacuation order, it is important to work with mission-critical and mission-essential
personnel to ensure the safety of their family members who are evacuating without them. If they have any
concerns about the ability of their family members to evacuate without them, they will be less compliant with
orders or requests to remain on base.
H-16. Clearance time refers to the time required to clear all evacuees from the evacuation routes and complete
movement to the shelter, safe haven, or designated receiving relocation site(s). Clearance time begins with
the evacuation order, continues as the first evacuating vehicle enters the transportation network, and ends
when the last evacuating vehicle reaches its destination. Clearance time includes the time required by
evacuees to secure their homes and prepare to leave (mobilization time), the time spent by evacuees traveling
along the road network (travel time), and the time spent by evacuees waiting along the road network due to
traffic congestion (delay time). Clearance time does not refer to the time a single vehicle spends traveling on
the road network. There may be a decision cutoff point when the projected clearance time exceeds the time
to the onset of the emergency. When that occurs, the area does not evacuate and personnel SIP or use a local
safe haven.
H-17. In calculating clearance times, the participation and occupancy rates of an area are taken into account.
Assuming 100 percent participation in the evacuation and 100 percent occupancy of residences in the area
increases clearance time. However, if clearance time is calculated under the assumption not all residents will
heed the evacuation orders or that the installation and its surrounding area are not at maximum capacity, the
calculation is less.
Appendix H 
H-4
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
H-18. In overseas locations, evacuations follow established Department of State evacuation procedures
available via the appropriate Embassy. Outside the United States and at forward operating bases, EMPs
include a section that provides evacuation procedures for noncombatant evacuation operations.
H-19. Mass casualty management requires greater numbers of medical treatment personnel to provide
emergency care. A mass casualty situation exists when the number of patients requiring care exceeds the
capabilities of initial responder medical personnel or resources. Medical responders make snap decisions on
how to best manage the casualties to provide the best care for the greatest number. In the event patient
numbers exceed local capacity for care and treatment, a mass casualty scenario turns into a patient evacuation
problem, which requires many of the same plans, assets, and resources as other evacuations.
H-20. The installation fire department or EMS normally provide medical evacuation from the incident site to
the nearest MTF. When organic installation EMS are not available, MOA/MOU may be established with the
off-installation EMS for the provision of these services. Deployable medical evacuation assets may also be
employed in patient evacuation.
H-21. As outlined in DODI 6200.03, Public Health Emergency Management within the Department of
Defense, PHEOs or their designees assess the public health aspects of evacuation management, including
noncombatant evacuation operations, to reduce the impact on the health and well-being of the vulnerable
population. The medical commander or PHEO/assistant PHEO—

Executes patient care plans and medical MAAs for patient care, medical facilities, and equipment.

Coordinates and provides medical first responder capabilities, emergency care, mass casualty care,
triage, first receiver care, patient movement, psychological support including religious support,
and pharmacy, dental, and veterinary services.

Develops patient care, coordinates fatality management with logistics community, and health care
system evacuation plans and procedures appropriate in all-hazards responses (including mass
casualty, isolation, and quarantine incidents).
H-22. MTFs coordinate MOAs/MOUs with local healthcare coalitions to ensure proper patient transfer and
evacuations are preplanned and rehearsed due to a mass casualty event. If installation owned EMS require
off-installation EMS capability; MTF manages patient tracking to off-installation hospitals.
RETURN FROM EVACUATION 
H-23. Depending on the impact of the incident and the progress of the subsequent essential-service restoration 
efforts, conditions may stabilize to a point it is safe for some personnel to move back to their original
locations. Based on the feedback from reconnaissance, the installation commander may deem it safe for
personnel to return to their original duty stations. These returning personnel need to be kept updated on safe
and available routes of movement as the recovery efforts continue. A well-executed and widely disseminated
COP significantly improves installation ability to keep evacuation and reentry operations running smoothly.
H-24. Returning from an evacuation requires extensive planning efforts. Evacuees returning to their homes
or work centers in evacuated areas require the same consideration, coordination, and control as they received
during the original evacuation. Some additional considerations are the availability of utilities, extent of debris
removal, structure inspection and approval for safe occupancy, availability of adequate water for firefighting,
and notification of local authorities regarding an increase in traffic flow to the installation.
SHELTER-IN-PLACE (SIP) 
H-25. An installation ensures the capability to prepare for, ensure communication of, and immediately
execute the safe and effective SIP of an at-risk population. SIP means to take immediate shelter without
moving to a new location; this could be at home, at work, at school, or in a vehicle in between. A SIP plan
and checklist for businesses and residences can be found on the Ready America web site:
https://www.ready.gov/ko/node/113..
H-26. In emergencies with limited or no warning time, temporary SIP within the individual’s workplace or
residence is the preferred protective action to avoid casualties and fatalities. SIP procedures use existing
buildings, residences, vessels, and vehicles to protect personnel from hazards when it is not practical or
Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
H-5
feasible to evacuate personnel in a timely manner. These locations are not certified as shelters and are staffed 
only by those personnel present. 
H-27. SIP may be required for a natural disaster, such as a storm or earthquake, or for an incident where
chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants are released into the environment. SIP to contain the
spread of an illness in a public health emergency is referred to as isolation and quarantine.
H-28. A recommendation order to start SIP also requires a follow-up recommendation to end SIP at the
appropriate time. Occupants ideally relocate to a reception center located outside of the hazard area once the
hazard has subsided to an appropriate level. If the SIP location is not vacated in a timely fashion, occupants
can be exposed to lingering low levels of contaminants.
H-29. SIP also has the collateral benefits of allowing on-scene responders to focus on lifesaving actions for
people who are outside when the hazard or threat strikes and of providing responders additional time to isolate
damaged infrastructure (for example, downed power lines, broken fuel mains). This focus is possible since
responders do not have to manage large crowds of evacuated personnel or deal with personnel blocking
emergency ingress routes.
H-30. The types of hazards which most lend themselves initially to SIP are as follows—

Destructive weather with little to no advance notice; for example, a tornado.

Seismic event (but not a resultant tsunami if the seismic event occurred underwater).

Utility failure (if not a prolonged outage).

Terrorist-caused event or HAZMAT incident involving chemicals and/or biological agents.

Terrorist or accidental radiological release.

Civil disturbance (including an active shooter).

Volcanic ash fall (depending on the expected time of arrival, amount, and duration and the
availability of alternative sheltering locations).
SIP PLANNING 
H-31. The following actions ensure the successful execution of SIP—

Install or implement mass warning notification systems.

Implement a geographic information system-based map grid system on medium to large
installations to facilitate the establishment of zones, and coordinate SIP data for buildings in those
zones. If possible, tailor mass warning notification system procedures to these zones.

Ensure the installation and/or regional dispatch center has the means, authority, and procedures to
activate a mass warning notification system that initiates SIP when directed by the IC or
installation EOC.

Coordinate emergency warning messages with public awareness training materials. Due to the
short time available for emergency messages, there is little opportunity for these messages to
explain what is meant by SIP; this understanding is provided in awareness training.

Identify which buildings and structures are adequate for SIP and provide probable ICs (fire,
security, environmental) with a list of the suitable and unsuitable structures available to them.

Avoid designating structures that have permanent openings and, thus, are not capable of being 
isolated from outside air (via doors, windows, and secured ventilation systems).

Avoid structures that must maintain air exchange to keep inside airborne levels from reaching
unhealthy concentrations (typically industrial-process facilities). Also avoid chemical and
biological laboratories and chemical storage areas.

Identify the closest structures that can be secured for each of the four primary wind directions
(north, east, south, and west). Personnel should not move in the direction of the hazard. Thus,
the IC, dispatch center, or EOC monitors and provides the wind direction at the hazardous
event location so the proper SIP location can be selected.

Notify personnel who work or live in structures that cannot be secured about information on
their alternative SIP locations.


Include the following as preferable building considerations:  heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning system that can be shut down quickly, physical security including manual
deadbolts, and locking windows.

Use areas with existing collective protection systems, if available.

Establish SIP procedures that are consistent with evacuation procedures. SIP procedures include
on-scene plans, dispatch center procedures, building plans, zone procedures, and EOC procedures.

Consider developing SIP management teams for each building that has been predetermined as
adequate for SIP. The SIP management team consists of zone managers (for medium to large
installations), the EOC sheltering coordinator, and a minimum of four SIP members for each SIP
building, including the building emergency coordinator, floor monitor(s), door monitor(s), and
building manager/maintenance staff. As an initial step, it may be more practical to build on the
organizational structure and personnel already designated in fire evacuation plans. The SIP
management team organization is designed to expand and contract as needed to meet the needs of
the incident. One person can fulfill multiple roles, depending on manpower availability and the
nature and expected duration of the incident.
SIP FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES 
H-32. As discussed in DODI 6200.03, the PHEO or designee plans and advises on the public health aspects
of SIP so the impact on the health and well-being of the vulnerable population is reduced during a public
health emergency. The installation commander, in consultation with the PHEO, has the authority to declare
a DOD public health emergency and to implement relevant emergency health powers (as outlined briefly
below) to achieve the greatest public health benefit while maintaining operational effectiveness.
QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION 
H-33. If the nature of the incident involves an infectious disease, quarantine or isolation may be needed
during the response/recovery phases to prevent contact between healthy populations and those infected,
suspected of being infected with, an infectious disease, whether natural or intentional (such as a biological
weapons attack). These decisions are made by the installation commander after consultation with the
command senior medical advisor and/or PHEO and in coordination with the local CDC quarantine officer as
outlined in DODI 6200.03.
H-34. Restriction of movement (ROM) refers to potentially infected persons to stop the spread of an
infectious disease or contagious illness. In the case of military personnel, restrictions of movement, including
isolation or quarantine, or any other measure necessary to prevent or limit transmitting a communicable
disease, may be implemented. Quarantine refers to the separation and ROM of persons who, while not yet ill
and have not shown signs and symptoms of the disease, have been exposed to an infectious agent and
therefore may become infectious. Quarantine involves the confinement and active continued health
surveillance of an individual who is suspected of having been exposed to an infectious agent until it is
determined that they are free of infection. Isolation is the separation of an infected individual from a healthy
population.
H-35. Installation commanders may use other forms of ROM and social distancing to maintain operational
effectiveness in the face of an infectious disease. The goal is to control the spread of the disease by restricting
contact between healthy groups of personnel and those who have, or are suspected of having, contracted the
disease. Personnel covered by ROM and practicing social distancing do not necessarily need to be removed
from operations. Rather, ROM and social distancing are implemented in such a way as to allow them to
continue their mission. Again, these decisions are made with recommendations furnished by the command
senior medical advisor and/or PHEO.
Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, and Lockdown

Public Health or Military Significance, and Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (OPNAVINST) 
6210.2A, Quarantine Regulations of the Navy, for detailed information. 
LOCKDOWN 
H-36. Lockdown is an announced emergency protocol used as a security measure to confine and restrict
movement. Included in the lockdown procedure are all military uniformed Services, Federal employees,
contractor personnel, dependents, or other people on an installation as a guest. Because of extenuating
circumstances, all personnel remain constrained inside the nearest vehicle, structure, or building that provides
a measure of protection.
H-37. During lockdown, no person may enter or exit an area until the all clear is broadcast, unless movement
is required to escape from a dangerous place or situation. All clear is announced over the installation warning
and notification system or through verbal communication by leadership through F&ES or security forces.
Lockdown is broadcast every 15 minutes until all clear is announced.
PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY 
H-38. Installation commanders approve a process for personnel accountability during emergencies based on
the procedures in DODI 3001.02, Personnel Accountability in Conjunction with Natural or Manmade
Disasters. The personnel accountability process is executed immediately upon implementing an order for
evacuation, SIP, or lockdown. All installation personnel, nonemployees (suppliers, visitors), and residents
are made aware of the command decision for evacuation, SIP, lockdown, movement to a safe haven, or
movement to a civilian shelter.
H-39. This process identifies virtual (off-site phone number, interactive notification system, website, or
collaborative portal) and physical rally points and provides them to all assigned personnel via community
preparedness tools. The personnel accountability process also includes a method of accounting for
nonemployees.

I-1
Appendix I 
Mass Care Operations 
Mass care operations consist of all community preparedness, interagency coordination, 
mass warning and notification, installation EOC, and field activities necessary to 
initiate and manage the care for personnel displaced for any duration due to any 
emergency. Mass care operations encompass a broad range of tasks that operate every 
aspect of a shelter or safe haven to meet the needs of a displaced population. 
MASS CARE 
I-1. 
Mass care operations include meeting the needs of a displaced population by providing access to a
shelter or safe haven, food and water, emergency supplies, emergency pharmaceuticals, and other goods from 
the time they are displaced until the time they return to the original residence or workplace. Sheltering can
occur at civilian community shelters, at local or remote safe havens (on the installation itself or on a remote
installation), or in a SIP scenario.
I-2. 
Mass care also includes continuous communication to evacuees throughout mass care operations. In
particular, up-to-date information is continuously provided to the displaced population about shelter
locations, transportation options, mass feeding operations, points of distribution for emergency goods and
pharmaceuticals, the evolution of the incident, and the extent and duration of displacement.
I-3. 
Mass care procedures include the capability to activate and manage the following—

Assistance center on the installation.

Local safe haven operations consisting of one or more facilities on the installation.

Coordination with one or more civilian shelters provided by one or more civil jurisdictions.

Remote safe haven operations at one or more predesignated, geographically remote receiving
installations.

Mass feeding operations at one or more locations on the installation.

POD operations for the distribution of goods and services at one or more locations.

Installation call center (or information hotline) operations for the distribution of approved
information to friends and family of evacuees, casualties, and fatalities.

Preexisting hazard-specific shelter locations (tornado shelters, fallout shelters).
I-4. 
Agreements with civilian authorities are established, when possible, to assist the installation population 
with mass care at local civilian locations. On the installation, basic mass care operations are also coordinated
by organic assets, such as community assistance centers or family assistance centers that are usually directed
by the department of morale, welfare, and recreation. Fleet and family support centers onboard Navy
installations also have organic mass care capabilities that can be leveraged during an incident.
I-5. 
For other information on mass care, including mass feeding, see ESF-6 in the NPF and FEMA CPG-
1-01. The American Red Cross has several helpful resources that are available online.
SAFE HAVENS 
I-6. 
Despite the existence of civilian shelters in the local community, installations are also prepared to
provide and maintain short-term mass care services. These safe havens are able to accommodate the protected 
population on base during an emergency if it is still safe to remain on base, or they are able to protect a
population from a neighboring base in the event the incident is occurring elsewhere. Safe havens are able to
operate for a short period of time before transportation to other, off-base accommodations is secured. The
installation emergency manager and the mass care coordinator collaborate with providers of emergency
Appendix I 
I-2
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 
assistance before an event in order to provide necessary assistance at a safe haven during an incident. Safe 
havens and other emergency family assistance centers are able to provide the following services— 

Registration, tracking, and personnel locator assistance.

Temporary lodging.

Access to sanitary facilities, potable water, food, and sufficient lighting.

Medical triage and information on available medical services.

Family assistance center to integrate victim and family services.

Behavioral health support and psychosocial services.

Religious and pastoral care.

Support services for special needs populations, including medical needs.

Support services for animal needs.

Communication about services available and the nature of the incident.

Adequate security.

Legal and financial assistance.

Coordination with casualty and mortuary affairs.

Transportation.

Translation services.

Child and youth services.
I-7. 
Local safe havens are generally only capable of providing temporary mass care for 5–7 days. After 72
hours (or less depending on the incident and the preparedness of the community), these temporary safe haven
residents are completely dependent on mass care operations for feeding, emergency supplies, shower and
sanitary facilities, laundry services, and even clothing. Remote safe havens vary significantly, and the
associated timeline for transition to temporary or permanent housing depends on the capabilities of the
receiving DOD installation. During this period, it is imperative installations quickly identify temporary
housing, on- and off-post and if available on nearby DOD installations in which to relocate safe haven
residents. Constant, honest engagement with safe haven residents on the process and the expected timeline is
a key component of the ongoing EPI process.
I-8. 
The safe haven management team is responsible for the coordination of safe haven operations. The
safe haven management team plans how to accommodate small- and large-scale evacuation operations for
people sent to or seeking local or remote safe havens. The general rules for safe haven operation and special
instructions are prepared, distributed, and available in each safe haven. The special instructions include
capacity; facility employees and their family members who will seek shelter in the safe haven facility; a list
of preassigned personnel designated to the safe haven; limits of the safe haven area; proposed layout; and the
location of communications facilities, emergency equipment, and utility cutoffs. Telephone directory and
emergency communications procedures are also available. The safe haven management team works in
coordination with the evacuation management team as described in appendix H.
MASS CARE PLANNING 
I-9. 
The mass care planning process includes identifying the available facilities and services which exist
on the installation and coordinating the use of such facilities and services during the response and recovery
operations. The identification of facilities and services to be used during mass care operations requires the
determination of service capabilities and capacities, the movement of personnel and providers to and from
designated locations (or services to and from designated PODs), and the necessary supporting infrastructure
(vehicles, communications, utilities, generators, compressed gas, information technology) required to
provide the given service at the given location during emergency conditions.
I-10. As with evacuation management, planning for mass care operations relies heavily on the demographic
information collected during the planning phase. Mass care planning for an installation also involves
determining what organic resources are available to the installation for maintaining safe havens and what
other resources are available in the neighboring community for the mass care of evacuated installation
populations.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
I-3
I-11. Mass care planning incorporates—

Community preparedness awareness and training.

Mass warning and notification system procedures.

Continued EPI throughout the response and recovery phases.

Personnel accountability procedures consistent with DODI 3001.02.

Facility management procedures, to include the use of pre- and post-incident signage, parking
management, access control, accountability, cost accounting, transportation services, and
utility/power services for identified mass care locations/facilities.

Procedures and resources for registration, personnel tracking/accountability, security, health
services, volunteer management, distribution of goods, client services (legal, insurance, travel,
temporary housing, school registration, counseling services), shower/bathroom services, laundry
services, child support/daycare services, animal management, and waste management services.

Procedures and resources for the provision of fuel, water, and emergency supplies to identified
local and remote safe havens and through the use of PODs.

Procedures for supporting and managing medical access and special needs populations, and
personnel with psychological effects.

Procedures for providing transportation assistance to and from mass care locations/facilities for
populations without access to transportation.

Procedures for non-English-speaking personnel and the visually and hearing impaired.

Procedures for further evacuation in case the incident expands or a second incident occurs.

Template mass care information sheets in multiple languages with locations of local safe havens,
civilian shelters, and PODs and information on community assistance center services.

Template safe haven resident information sheets in multiple languages with rules and guidelines
for local safe havens, to include standardized policies on registration, children, personal
belongings, mobile phone use, animals, smoking, alcohol, drugs, weapons, quiet hours,
music/video player/game use, parking, volunteers, security, and health services.
I-12. Populations in urban environments with lower household income and/or with the lowest fear of
property security (that their home will be protected by LE while away) are the most likely to seek a public
safe haven or civilian shelter when impacted by an emergency or when directed to move to a safe haven or
civilian shelter by authorities. For example, these categories may encompass junior enlisted personnel,
barracks populations, and family housing area residents. Refer to FEMA Community Mass Care
Management course for more information.
I-13. The safe haven management team determines suitable locations for safe havens using the following
guidance and presents their findings to the EMWG for approval by the installation commander. Although not
all of the following considerations/needs must be met, safe havens strive to include as many as possible—

Safe and secure location.

Suitable space for sleeping quarters.

Secured storage areas.

Suitable space for people with animals.

Adequate supply of drinking water (5 gallons/person/day).

Adequate toilet and bathing facilities (1 toilet/20 people; 1 shower head/25 people).

Provisions for cooking and serving food, if possible.

Fire and police protection.

Adequate parking.

Exterior walls made of concrete block or reinforced concrete.

Load-bearing interior walls.

Doorframes securely attached to the structure and properly braced.

Windows with impact protection from flying debris.

Personnel areas located away from unprotected windows and doors.

Structure able to resist wind uplift forces.

TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
28 July 2021 

Properly attached roof cladding.

Finished floors at least 15 feet above mean sea level for coastal areas and at least 15 feet above
floodplain level for inland areas (a structurally sound, multi-floor building that is less than 15 feet
above mean sea level may still be used as a safe haven with occupancy on floors above that
minimum).

Inside stairwells and ready access to exits.

No hazardous utility lines (steam, gas, oil) located in or near the safe haven (unless provision is
made to control such hazards via valve alignment or other means).

No units of access and egress less than 28 inches wide. At least two widely separated means of
egress.

Emergency power.

Appropriate size (consider facilities such as churches or restaurants for up to 100 people and
schools, hotels, conference centers, and sport complexes for more than 100 people).

Facility compliance with AT standards.
I-14. Electrical power may or may not be available from normal sources in a disaster situation; however,
consideration is given to the use of local, unit, and installation portable emergency generators to provide
power to safe havens. Where such generators are included in safe haven plans, the plans also include a 2-
week fuel supply, emergency refueling procedures for each generator, and the electrical tie-in of the
generators to minimum-essential operational and environmental circuitry. Portable generators must never be
operated indoors, or deadly levels of carbon monoxide can accumulate. See the OSHA fact sheet at
http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_Hurricane_Facts/portable_generator_safety.pdf .
RAPID NEEDS ASSESSMENT 
I-15. In order to quickly identify post-incident mass care, medical care, public health, and behavioral health
needs, installations develop and execute a rapid needs assessment process. The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has published Guidelines for Assessment in Emergencies that can be
a useful in tailoring a rapid needs assessment process for an installation. These guidelines can be found at
https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/responding/.
I-16. Rapid needs assessments are designed to quickly provide accurate and inexpensive population-based
information needed to match a community’s mass care needs with the available resources. Early assessments
combined with rapid mobilization of resources can significantly reduce human suffering and the potential for
secondary medical, public health, and behavioral health impacts.
ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS 
I-17. Persons with transportation needs include any individual who, by reason of illness, injury, age,
congenital malfunction, or other permanent or temporary incapacity or disability, is unable without special
facilities or special planning or design to use mass transportation facilities as effectively as persons who are
not so affected. Within the transportation needs category, those with access and functional needs differ in
severity and extent of disabilities; the way in which other people view their physical and mental limitations;
and their income, age, and mobility. Persons with transportation needs are those who find it difficult to
evacuate without aid from community members, caretakers, family members, friends, or rescue workers.
Persons with transportation needs often include the elderly and people with disabilities and can include
persons with medical needs. Persons with transportation needs also include fully mobile people who have no
means of transportation off the installation. This may be due to lack of financial capability to pay for public
transportation, or, where none exists, may be due to a lack of a vehicle (such as, a car).
I-18. Persons with medical needs include those with potentially life-threatening conditions and/or chronic
medical/physical conditions requiring specialty care or follow-up support more than once a year. Medical
needs persons also include those with current and chronic behavioral health conditions, those who have
required inpatient or intensive outpatient behavioral health service from any provider within the last five
years or at the present time. Other qualifications include a diagnosis of asthma or other respiratory-related
diagnosis with chronic recurring wheezing which meets specified criteria and a diagnosis of attention deficit
Mass Care Operations 
28 July 2021 
TM 3-11.42/MCTP 10-10G/NTTP 3-11.36/DAFTTP 3-2.83 
I-5
disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that meets the specified criteria, requires adaptive equipment, 
requires assistive technology devices or services, and/or requires environmental/architectural considerations. 
I-19. All persons with access and functional needs must have access to the same safe havens as persons
without access and functional needs. Although not required, if deemed appropriate by the EM, safe havens
for persons with access and functional needs may be set up; however, all other safe havens still accept persons
with access and functional needs. The EMWG considers the following in planning for those with access and
functional needs—

Ensure accessible entrances, toilet and bathroom facilities, and safe haven area for those with
wheelchairs and scooters.

Ensure adequate refrigeration or cooler availability for those with medications.

Ensure safe haven staff are properly trained to assist those with access and functional needs before
a disaster strikes.

Include persons with access and functional needs in safe havens; persons with access and
functional needs should not be separated from any other persons in the safe haven except where
necessary due to conflicts with animals and persons with allergies or fears of certain animals.

Allow service animals (trained dogs and miniature horses) that assist access and functional needs
persons into the safe haven, and allow the animals to remain with their handlers.

Ensure availability of generators.

Ensure all safe haven information and announcements are accessible to those who are deaf, hard
of hearing, blind, or visually impaired.
ANIMAL NEEDS MANAGEMENT 
I-20. A plan for addressing the needs and care of animals in the event of an evacuation is also developed for
each EM program. Whether animals are to be allowed in a safe haven is the decision of the installation
commander. If animals are allowed in remote safe havens, there is a signed agreement between the two
installations or organizations. The commander is required to provide accommodations for American
Disability Act trained and certified service animals, the service animal, and the handler can only be separated
under special circumstances such as the handler requiring surgery.
I-21. Keeping animals and their owners together is a way of reducing stress on disaster survivors. Dealing
with separated owners and their animals can become a predominant issue in large-scale evacuations. Close
cooperation with the animal-care community is the best way to plan for and respond to these issues. Local
community veterinarians and animal control or humane shelter directors can be asked to coordinate
evacuations and rescues of animals in an organized manner.
COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE CENTER 
I-22. EM programs establish procedures for creating a community assistance center (or similar center) to
provide services based upon the needs of the specific emergency. The community assistance center (or
similar) provides the following services—

Mass care registration services.

Personnel accountability liaison.

Volunteer management service.

Donations management service.

Support services for non-English-speaking, hearing impaired, visually impaired, and physically
impaired populations.

Information on safe haven and civilian shelter locations, transportation routes and services,
laundry locations, shower/bath facility locations, PODs, and utilities and power outages.

Service liaisons:  health services, access and functional needs populations, animal needs
populations, utility providers (gas, water, power, waste management), and U.S. Postal Service.

Client services:  individual assistance programs, legal counsel, banking services, insurance claim
services, travel services (aviation, rail, bus, ferry, and rental cars), school/childcare/daycare
registration, counseling services, and housing coordination services.

28 July 2021 
PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS 
I-23. As outlined in DODI 6200.03, PHEOs or their designees plan for and advise on the public health
aspects of mass care and access and functional needs populations to reduce impact on the health and well-
being of the vulnerable population during a public health emergency.
I-24. DOD installations develop a mass prophylaxis plan for ensuring the mass distribution of
prophylactic/curative medications during a public health emergency. In executing mass prophylaxis, each
installation leverages its own inherent capability as well as the capabilities of supporting resources (for
example, civilian institutions, local health departments, or access to the Strategic National Stockpile [SNS]).
Medical logistics tracks mass prophylaxis and other medical supplies.
I-25. Logistics, facilities, security, and medical support functions coordinate a unified effort to set up one or
more PODs for the allocation of prophylactic/treatment medications. The location and supply of PODs is
usually coordinated with parallel civilian support functions, since receipt and distribution of medications and
supplies within the SNS is coordinated with the state or local entity governing SNS distribution, as discussed
in the interagency agreement between DOD and Department of Health and Human Services on the support
of contingency medical materiel requirements.
Note. USMC installations are prohibited from serving as open PODs for the general public.
