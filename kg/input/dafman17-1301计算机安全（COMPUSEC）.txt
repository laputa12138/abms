This Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) implements Air Force Policy Directive 
(AFPD) 17-1, Information Dominance Governance and Management, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 
17-130, Cybersecurity Program Management, and Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 
(DoDI) 8551.01, Ports, Protocols, and Services Management, with a focus on Computer Security 
(COMPUSEC). This manual applies to all civilian employees and uniformed members of the U.S. 
Space Force (USSF), the Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air Force Reserve (AFR), Air National 
Guard (ANG), the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) when conducting missions as the official Air Force (AF) 
Auxiliary, and those with a contractual obligation to abide by the terms of Department of the Air 
Force (DAF) issuances, except when noted otherwise. Failure to obey the terms of the User 
Agreements - DAF Form 4394, The Department of the Air Force User Agreement Statement - 
Notice and Consent Provision, and when applicable, DAF Form 4433, The Department of the Air 
Force Mobile Device User Agreement —per paragraphs 2.17.1, 7.4, and 7.6 (including its

or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the DAF. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This manual, formerly issued as AFMAN 17-1301, has been updated and reissued as DAFMAN 
17-1301. Significant revisions have been made to clarify COMPUSEC requirements and ensure 
alignment with DAFMAN 90-161. Key updates include clearer guidance on accountability and 
responsibilities for military personnel, civilian employees, and contractors, and revised sections 
on Ports, Protocols, and Services Management, as well as IT hardware procurement. User 
Agreements (DAF Forms 4433 and 4394) are now referenced as Prescribed Forms with their 
intent clarified, and a Virtual Mobile Infrastructure User Agreement for mobile devices has been 
attached to DAF Form 4433. Redundancies were eliminated, SAP equities references were 
removed, chapters were reorganized, and the section on abbreviations, acronyms, and terms was 
expanded. Additionally, a new table of valid URL references and governance document references 
has been added, along with guidance on safeguarding classified data at rest. Prohibitions on 
connecting Internet of Things devices to DAF systems and government-furnished equipment were 
introduced, and responsibilities for Wing or Delta Cybersecurity Offices were updated. 
Further changes include adding a required Privacy Act statement for forms collecting personal 
information, proper tiering of T-0 based on federal law, and greater specificity regarding roles and 
exceptions. The Sixteenth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber) must now inform the DAF CISO of 
configuration changes affecting compliance with DoDI 8551.01, focusing on information sharing 
rather than prior approval. Foreign IT use must comply with NDAA 2023 Section 5459 and NDAA 
2019 Section 889. The manual also addresses policy gaps in DISPATCH, IT procurement, data 
spillages, and sanitization processes. Clarifications include the treatment of classified information, 
end-of-life procedures, reclassification, and requirements for cybersecurity-enabled IT software 
and sanitization software. Updates also address device usage (e.g., laptops connected to hotspots) 
and processing sensitive data. A conflict with AFI 17-130 on waiver authorities was resolved.

Reflecting broader DoD and DAF policy updates, the manual incorporates changes related to 
mobile devices, wireless capabilities, and the reuse of media containing Controlled Unclassified 
Information. A comprehensive review is strongly recommended.

Chapter 5 
REMANENCE SECURITY 
5.1.  Introduction.  Remanence is the residual information remaining on storage media. 
Remanence security actions are taken to protect the confidentiality of information on information 
systems (including infrastructure devices such as routers and switches). See the information system 
security authorization package for system-specific incident response and remanence security 
procedures. Exercise risk management procedures according to DoDI 8500.01, CJCSI 6510.01F, 
and NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization.  
5.1.1.  DAF policy is to safeguard classified and sensitive information, no matter what the 
media. Safeguarding classified and sensitive information in computer memory and media is 
particularly important during routine maintenance, product end-of-life, and reuse. Information 
System Owners, privileged users, ISSMs, Information System Security Officers, WCOs, 
operations personnel, and other responsible people should know the risk factors before 
sanitizing information systems media and releasing them from the controlled environment. 
Except where specifically called out, ISSMs, Information System Security Officers, 
Information System Owners, WCOs, and cybersecurity workforce personnel entrusted with 
privileged roles are responsible for compliance with this chapter. To protect against 
compromise, allow only authorized and properly cleared persons with a need-to-know access 
to media containing classified and sensitive information. 
5.1.2.  Risk Assessment. Balance risk management decisions on information sensitivity, 
threats and vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness and potential impact of the decided action. 
5.1.2.1.  When assessing the risk of releasing information systems media from DoD 
control, the Information System Security Officer should develop procedures that identify 
the residual risk and risk tolerance (the acceptable level of risk as determined by the 
Information System Owner). Follow the guidance in NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Guide for 
Conducting Risk Assessments. 
5.1.2.2.  The Information System Security Officer, assisted by the WCO, assesses the risks 
in consultation with the Wing Information Protection Office before deciding whether to 
sanitize for reuse or disposal. See the current 616 Operations Center Tasking Order for 
guidance about reuse after Negligent Discharge of Classified Information sanitization 
actions. The AFIN Mission Assurance Center (AMAC) established the risk identification, 
management, and mitigation measures identified for Negligent Discharge of Classified 
Information events. The EAO memo addresses end-of-life, reclassification, sanitization 
software criteria, and handling of classified data on unclassified media within their 
boundary. 
5.1.2.3.  The Information System Owner and the information owners consider the full 
range of vulnerabilities and security implications to include the actual loss if an 
unauthorized entity extracts the residual information, the threat directed against this 
information, the threat of recovery, and the potential for damage. 
 
 
36 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
5.1.3.  Risk Management. Utilizing remanence security within an organization is a risk 
management process that involves the information owner, Information System Owner, ISSM, 
Information System Security Officer, Wing Information Protection, and Security 
Assistant/Manager to make a determination of potential impact prior to sanitizing media or 
devices for reuse or disposal. The decision is based on a complete risk analysis that involves 
the identification of organizational mission, mission impacts, threats, and possible compromise 
to the information system or information. A thorough cost-benefit analysis coupled with 
mission priorities provides the framework for this decision. 
5.1.3.1.  Once the risk analysis has been completed, the ISSM/Information System Security 
Officer documents the mitigations and any residual risk in the information system security 
authorization package and plan of actions and milestones. 
5.1.3.2.  As the monetary cost of media decreases, the cost of sanitizing media may become 
impractical, and destruction may become more cost-effective. Costs to be considered in the 
sanitization and destruction decision include the purchase price of sanitization software 
and degaussing/destruction equipment, periodic recertification of equipment, cost of 
outsourcing, and time required for verification, documentation, and tracking of sanitized 
media. 
5.2.  Sanitization.  Remanence security actions to sanitize medium (smartphone, flash memory, 
random access memory and read-only memory, optical disks, solid state drives, magnetic disks, 
and hard disk drives, etc.) are dependent upon the classification of data contained within the device. 
5.2.1.  Sanitization of unclassified devices follows NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1. The term 
“sanitization” is defined in NIST SP 800-88, Rev.1 as a process to render access to target data 
on the media infeasible for a given level of effort. Clear, purge, and destroy are actions that 
can be taken to sanitize media. Clearing for reuse within the same classification does not 
require a witness. The sanitization/degaussing/destruction of classified media requires a 
witness/validator. 
5.2.1.1.  Clear – A method of sanitization that applies logical techniques to sanitize data in 
all user-addressable storage locations for protection against simple non-invasive data 
recovery techniques; typically applied through the standard Read and Write commands to 
the storage device, such as by rewriting with a new value or using a menu option to reset 
the device to the factory state (where rewriting is not supported). 
5.2.1.2.  Purge – A method of sanitization that applies physical or logical techniques that 
render target data recovery infeasible using state-of-the-art laboratory techniques. 
5.2.1.3.  Destroy – Renders target data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory 
techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data. 
5.2.2.  Sanitization of classified devices follows the NSA/Central Security Service Policy 
Manual 9-12, NSA/CSS Storage Device Sanitization Manual, and involves the destruction of 
the 
media 
and/or 
data 
via 
degaussing, 
incineration, 
disintegration, 
shredding, 
embossing/knurling, 
chopping/pulverizing/wet 
pulping 
(paper), 
grinding, 
strip 
shredding/cutting, or power removal (dynamic random-access memory, static random-access 
memory, and volatile field programmable gate array). Only products listed on the NSA 
Evaluated Products List or received approval from the NSA may be used to destroy classified 
information (to include media and devices) per NSA/Central Security Service Policy Manual 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
37 
9-12. Contact the NSA/Central Security Service System and Network Analysis Center at (410) 
854-6358 or via email at SNAC@radium.ncsc.mil, to obtain technical guidance concerning 
appropriate methods, equipment, and standards for destroying classified electronic media, IT 
equipment, electronic components, and other similar or associated materials. The 
sanitization/degaussing/destruction of classified solid state and/or magnetic media requires a 
witness/validator. 
5.2.2.1.  Degauss (hard disk drives/diskettes) – Process for reducing the magnetization of 
a storage device to zero by applying a reverse (coercive) magnetizing force, rendering any 
previously stored data unreadable and unintelligible, and ensuring that it cannot be 
recovered by any technology known to exist. Classified IT storage media cannot be 
declassified by overwriting per DoDM5200.01v3_DAFMAN16-1404v3 and DoDM 
5200.01, Volume 3. 
5.2.2.2.  Embossing/Knurling (compact discs/digital versatile discs) – One or two rotating 
knurled shafts press down on the surface, elongating the focal point and making all 
information unreadable and inaccessible. 
5.2.2.3.  Grinding (compact discs) – Sanitize by destroying the surface of the optical 
storage media; versatile digital discs and Blu-Ray discs have information layers in the 
middle of the disc, making grinding ineffective for sanitization. 
5.2.2.4.  Disintegration (hard disk drives/diskettes/compact discs/digital versatile 
discs/solid state drives) – Reduces the storage media into small fragments of a specific size, 
depending upon the type, using a knife mill. 
5.2.2.5.  Incinerate (hard disk drives/diskettes/compact discs/digital versatile discs/Blu-
Ray Disks/solid state drives) – Destruction using high heat/temperatures to reduce the 
media into ash. 
5.2.2.6.  Shredding (diskettes/compact discs/digital versatile discs) – Physical shredding of 
media into small strips using two interlocking patterned drums that rotate in opposing 
directions. 
5.2.2.7.  Power Removal (dynamic random access memory/static random access 
memory/volatile field programmable gate array) – Clearing of volatile memory by 
removing power source for a specific duration. 
5.2.2.8.  Strip Shredding or Cutting (smart cards only) – Destruction of smart cards by 
cutting or shredding in small pieces. 
5.2.3.  When sanitization cannot be accomplished (e.g., inoperable disk), destroy the media 
according to DoDM5200.01v3_DAFMAN16-1404v3 and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3. 
5.3.  Media Reuse.  Sanitize media to ensure that no data or information remains on operable 
media that are to be reused within the DoD. 
5.3.1.  Clear unclassified media that does not contain sensitive data before reuse; purge media 
containing sensitive data prior to reuse. Reference NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1. (T-0). 
 
 
38 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
5.3.2.  Ensure removal of data from the information system, its storage devices, and other 
peripheral devices (e.g., copiers or printers) with storage capacity in such a way that the data 
may not be reconstructed (e.g., clear, or purge), rendering stored information unrecoverable. 
(T-0) 
5.3.3.  Clear classified media before reuse and reuse only in a classified environment according 
to CJCSI 6510.01F. Classified storage media may not be sanitized and declassified for reuse 
in an unclassified environment (see Enclosure C of CJCSI 6510.01F). (T-0). 
5.3.4.  Devices involved in secret level spills and below may be reused at the original 
classification level if sanitized by an approved sanitization software, labeled as NDCI, and 
properly tracked; see paragraph 4.5. Otherwise, it must be either used at the higher 
classification level or destroyed IAW NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12. See the current 616 
Operations Center Tasking Order. 
5.3.5.  Before media can be reused in a classified environment or released from organizational 
control, complete a separate administrative procedure for declassification. Refer to NSA/CSS 
Policy Manual 9-12 for declassification procedures. To determine the classification of the data, 
consult the applicable system classification guide. The Defense Technical Information Center 
maintains a repository and index of security classification guides according to 
DoDM5200.01v1_AFMAN16-1404v1, 
Information 
Security 
Program: 
Overview, 
Classification, and Declassification, and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, DoD Information 
Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, or contact the 
system/enclave ISSM for a copy. 
5.4.  Disposal.  Disposal is the process of reutilizing, transferring, donating, selling, destroying, or 
other final removal of media from service. Disposal of government hardware and software is 
governed by DoDM 4160.21, Volume 4, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual: Instructions for 
Hazardous Property and Other Special Processing Materiel, and DoDM 4160.21, Volume 2, 
Defense Materiel Disposition Manual: Property Disposal and Reclamation. Note:  Disposal of 
records data on government hardware and software is per the Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule, which is located in the Air Force Records Information Management System. 
Unauthorized disposition of records data can result in a lost records incident per AFI 33-322 and 
may be reported to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 
5.4.1.  Purge or destroy all unclassified information system storage media before leaving the 
control of the DoD, according to NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1 and paragraph 5.2.1.. (T-1). 
5.4.1.1.  Dispose of unclassified electronic media according to NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1. 
Dispose of unclassified computing systems and hard drives according to 
DoDM5200.01v3_DAFMAN16-1404v3 and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3, Enclosure 7. 
When no longer needed, unclassified computer systems and hard drives may be disposed 
of outside the DoD. In some circumstances, the equipment may be provided to non-
government entities for reutilization. For devices involved in secret-level spill events and 
lower, ensure the device has been properly marked as NDCI and tracked, and destroyed 
upon reaching end of life. See the current 616 Operations Center Tasking Order. (T-1). 
5.4.1.2.  The Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services disposes of excess property 
received from the military services. Turned-in property is first offered for reutilization 
within the DoD, then transferred to other Federal agencies or donations to state/local 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
39 
governments and other qualified organizations. The de-manufacture program is the 
resource recovery and recycling program designed to reclaim precious metals and recycle 
scrap for equipment that is not usable (end of lifecycle, destroyed, etc.). For more 
information about the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (see Table A.2–
URLs). 
5.4.1.3.  For unclassified information systems, track and dispose of storage media 
previously contaminated with classified data as classified media according to CJCSI 
6510.01F. (T-0). Additionally, reference DoDM5200.01v3_DAFMAN16-1404v3 and 
DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3, Enclosure 3 for disposal and destruction guidelines. For 
classified information, follow the procedures outlined in NSA/Central Security Service 
Policy Manual 9-12 for destruction and declassification. Additionally, seek guidance from 
the DAF COMPUSEC Field Support office at daf.compusec.field.support@us.af.mil for 
document destruction procedures. 
5.4.2.  Destroy all classified information system storage media unless being used in an 
information system environment at the same or higher classification level. Reuse of classified 
information system storage media in unclassified environments is not authorized. (T-0). At the 
end of life, destroy according to CJCSI 6510.01F and the sanitization/declassification 
procedures of NSA/Central Security Service Policy Manual 9-12 and paragraph 5.2.2. (T-0). 
Follow DoDM 4160.21 Volumes 2 and 4 for de-manufacture (precious metals recovery) 
procedures. For installations without the means to sanitize or verify sanitization, the NSA does 
accept and will destroy some classified media. Follow the guidance on the NSA Classified 
Materiel Conversion for packaging, documenting, and shipping devices at NSA Classified 
Materiel Conversion (CMC) website (see Table A.2–URLs). Direct questions to the Classified 
Materiel Conversion Customer Service Office at 301-688-6672 or via email at cmc@nsa.gov. 
5.5.  Mixed Media Devices.  Hardware with multiple or mixed media types must be treated 
appropriately to ensure thorough sanitization. Follow the classification and sanitization methods 
outlined in the NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12 or NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1 for each media type. 
Complete sanitization involves addressing all media within the device. Devices like computers, 
routers, switches, and multifunction devices may harbor diverse media types, necessitating tailored 
sanitization methods based on media type and operational environment classification. Most 
network architecture devices are equipped with solid-state storage devices such as random-access 
memory, read-only memory, field programmable gate array, smart cards, and flash memory. 
Specific sanitization protocols exist for dynamic random-access memory, static random access 
memory, ferroelectric random access memory, magnetic random access memory, erasable 
programmable read-only memory, ultra-violet erasable programmable read-only memory, and 
electrically erasable programmable read-only memory.

Chapter 6 
PORTS, PROTOCOLS, AND SERVICES MANAGEMENT 
6.1.  Introduction.  Ports, Protocols, and Services (PPS) require association with the applicable 
hardware or software discovered during the PPS declaration activity during the risk management 
framework process. PPS used throughout AFIN require compliance with DoDI 8170.01, Online 
Information Management and Electronic Messaging. (T-0). The declaration of PPS is based upon 
official business or AO-determined requirements. PPS registration in the DoD Ports, Protocols, 
and Services Management (PPSM) Registry database only occurs as a result of a new authorization 
or through a configuration change to the information system with a security impact analysis 
generated by the ISSM. Except where specifically called out, ISSMs, Information System Security 
Officers, and cybersecurity workforce personnel entrusted with privileged roles supporting an 
information system are responsible for compliance with this chapter. 
6.1.1.  New system authorization:  The AO approves the use of PPS via the assessment and 
authorization process, and once the new system has been authorized, the ISSM requests 
registration. The authorization and registration process should be considered in mapping 
efforts for cyber mission relevant terrain. 
6.1.2.  Reauthorization of an existing system:  The ISSM reviews the PPS, documents any 
changes, and requests an update to the existing PPS registration upon reauthorization. 
6.1.2.1.  Review boundary protection device rules annually, at a minimum, for compliance 
with CJCSI 6510.01F, DoDI 8551.01, and this manual. (T-1). 
6.1.2.2.  Monitor implementation of PPS based upon continuous monitoring guidance, 
IAW NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal 
Information Systems and Organizations, Step 6, Monitor Security Controls. 
6.1.3.  Modifications to the PPS registration:  The requestor contacts the system ISSM to 
initiate a change request to modify the PPS for a registered system. The ISSM reviews the 
request, conducts a risk assessment, generates the security impact assessment, and submits a 
request to update the existing PPS registration, if applicable. 
6.1.3.1.  If the ISSM determines the risk exceeds the risk tolerance for the system, the 
request should be denied until sufficient mitigations are implemented as outlined in AFI 
17-101. The ISSM follows DoDI 8510.01 for monitoring security controls if the residual 
risk adversely affects the security posture of the system. 
6.1.3.2.  Consult the DoD PPS Category Assurance List and PPS Vulnerability Assessment 
reports for a list of conditions, mitigations, and approved boundary crossings. 
6.1.3.3.  Air Force Network modifications:  All changes should be coordinated through the 
Base change sponsor and the system/enclave ISSM; follow Methods and Procedures 
Technical Order 00-33A-1100. 
6.1.4.  Protect and regulate the use of PPS through interconnection agreements, access control 
mechanisms, and boundary protection devices according to DoDI 8551.01, Cybersecurity 
Service Provide (CSSP), internal cybersecurity, and this manual. 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
41 
6.1.4.1.  Applications and platform IT systems should document and maintain a list of all 
existing and potential hosting enclaves; see AFI 17-101. 
6.1.4.2.  Hosting enclaves should document and maintain a list of all hosted information 
systems and interconnected information systems covered by a separate assessment and 
authorization package, see AFI 17-101. The list must include the DoD PPSM Tracking 
Identifier for each information system. (T-1). 
6.2.  Ports, Protocols, and Services Management.  PPS for information systems connecting to, 
operating on, or traversing across the AFIN follow policies to catalog, regulate, and control their 
use based on vulnerabilities and risk. Approval for the use of PPS by an information system only 
occurs through the risk management framework process, according to AFI 17-101. The ISSM has 
the responsibility of ensuring that the PPS used by the information system is compliant with DoD 
PPSM policies. (T-0). 
6.2.1.  Limit the use of PPS to only the communications interfaces required for information 
systems to meet mission needs, also known as the “least function” security principle. (T-0). 
6.2.2.  Identify and document the PPS within the authorization boundary of the information 
system according to the following conditions: 
6.2.2.1.  Associate the PPS with hardware and software listed in the component inventory 
for the information system. 
6.2.2.2.  Attribute the ports, protocols, and services to each network service “listening” for 
client connection on only the necessary TCP/UDP ports, if possible, to comply with the 
security concept of “least function” for hardware and software. 
6.2.2.3.  Ensure configuration management and control for the hardware and software, 
including the PPS, exists under the applicable Information System Owner. 
6.2.2.4.  Determine the actual or expected users and their communications interfaces to the 
hardware and/or software. For example, users located on the Internet, from a different DoD 
component, or within the same hosting enclave. 
6.2.2.5.  Verify all PPS within the authorization boundary of the information system do not 
duplicate the PPS under the control and cognizance of another DoD information system. 
6.2.2.6.  Use the DAF PPSMBI Workbook to document these communications interfaces. 
This document will serve as an artifact for the risk management framework and document 
compliance with DoD PPSM standards. 
6.2.2.7.  PPS documentation must be consistent with functional dataflow diagrams and 
network topology diagrams. (T-1). 
6.2.3.  Implement PPSM standards for software and hardware using the DoD PPSM Category 
Assurance List and applicable DoD PPS Vulnerability Assessment reports available from the 
DoD Cyber Exchange Category Assurance List; URL is available at Table A.2. (T-0). 
6.2.3.1.  The use of PPS not listed on the DoD PPSM Category Assurance List (e.g., no 
applicable DoD PPS Vulnerability Assessment Report) is not authorized and does not 
comply with DoD policy requiring risk assessment. Follow the applicable DoD process for 
Component Local Service Assessment (CLSA) or risk assessment and PPS guidance on 
42 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
the DAF Cybersecurity Collaborative Environment for documenting and assessing the 
vulnerabilities for the use of these unknown and/or unevaluated PPS. 
6.2.3.2.  Changes to published DoD PPS Vulnerability Assessment reports require 
supporting documentation, review, and approval. (T-0). Follow the guidance on the DAF 
Cybersecurity Collaborative Environment for PPS to submit requests for changes to the 
Vulnerability Assessment reports issued by DoD. 
6.2.4.  After approval from an AO, the PPS registration actions formally declare the use of the 
PPS for the associated information system within DoD-level databases available to all DoD 
Components. 
6.2.4.1.  Registration enables the regulation and control of PPS across networks, 
connection authorizations, hosting enclave coordination, and other activities to achieve 
interoperability and availability. 
6.2.4.2.  Members of the assessment and authorization team request registration of the 
information system’s PPS using eMASS workflow process (see Table A.2–URLs). PPS 
registrations will be managed through the RMF Step 3/Step 5 or IATT workflows. 
6.2.4.3.  Upon successful registration, each information system receives a unique, 9-
character alpha-numeric DoD PPSM Tracking Identifier. PPSM Tracking Identifiers with 
a “U” prefix indicate operation on the unclassified network environment, while the “C” 
prefix indicates operation on the classified network environment. 
6.2.4.4.  Updates to the existing PPS registration for an information system should follow 
the configuration management plans, security impact assessment processes, and 
continuous monitoring activities for the information system under the risk management 
framework, see AFI 17-101. 
6.2.4.5.  Registration confirmation notices and the PPS details generated from the DoD 
PPSM Registry become official artifacts for the system of record. File these artifacts with 
the risk management framework authorization package to support connection 
authorizations, change requests for network devices/assets, and cybersecurity reciprocity. 
6.2.5.  Identify and document the PPS associated with interconnected information systems 
according to the following conditions: 
6.2.5.1.  Applies to PPS with any Internet Protocol-based communications interface to the 
“listening” service or service of another application or information system with its own 
DoD authorization package. These PPS do not exist within the authorization boundary of 
the subject information system since the hardware and software fall under the configuration 
control of a different Information System Owner. 
6.2.5.2.  Verify all PPS within the authorization boundary of the information system do not 
duplicate the PPS under the control and cognizance of the interconnected information 
systems. Only one information system may declare the “listening” service or service of 
hardware and/or software based on configuration control policies. 
6.2.5.3.  Use an interconnection artifact, service level agreement, or other similar document 
to identify these communications interfaces. The document will serve as an artifact for the 
risk management framework. 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
43 
6.2.6.  Exceptions to DoD PPSM standards follow the DoD PPSM Exception Management 
Process and guidance on the DAF Cybersecurity Collaborative Environment for PPS. 
6.2.6.1.  Exceptions apply to the use of a PPS already evaluated by DoD PPSM with 
deviations to the standards specified in the applicable DoD PPS Vulnerability Assessment 
report. This process provides the Information System Owner with the ability to use non-
standard PPS based upon an operational need. The DoD PPSM Technical Advisory Group 
and Configuration Control Board will review the non-standard use to determine whether 
the deviation and implemented measures mitigate shared risk to the DoD Information 
Network. 
6.2.6.2.  After completion of the necessary risk management framework actions for non-
compliance and guidance for the documentation requirements from the DAF Cybersecurity 
Collaborative Environment, submission of the exception request will use the eMASS 
workflow process (see Table A.2–URLs). 
6.2.6.3.  Any exceptions under the purview of USCYBERCOM must first follow the DoD 
PPSM Exception Management Process (see Table A.2–URLs). (T-0). 
6.2.7.  For time-sensitive operational interoperability in support of operations with limited 
duration, Information System Owners and AOs may request temporary use of PPS not listed 
on the DoD PPSM Category Assurance List according to DoDI 8551.01. Follow the DoD 
PPSM Exception Management Process and PPS guidance on the DAF Cybersecurity 
Collaborative Environment. 
6.2.8.  Records in the DoD PPSM Registry require review on an annual basis, at a minimum, 
to validate system information, points of contacts, and ensure that all communications 
interfaces remain accurate and up to date. Failure to keep records current will result in removal 
from the DoD PPSM Registry, which will impact connection authorizations. (T-2). 
6.2.9.  Boundary protection devices employ a “deny by default, permit by exception” policy 
for both ingress and egress rules or policy objects. (T-0). 
6.2.9.1.  Changes to rules require supporting evidence of AO approval for the information 
system, connection authorization, and DoD PPS registration. (T-0). 
6.2.9.2.  Changes to rules under the applicability of DoDI 8551.01 require the DoD PPS 
Registration Confirmation Details artifact as supporting evidence for the change. 
6.2.9.3.  Changes to other network devices that enable Internet Protocol-based 
communications follow the same requirements for boundary protection devices. This 
includes, but is not limited to, application whitelisting, Domain Name Service records, 
firewalls, next-generation firewalls, application-layer gateways, web application firewalls, 
web content filtering, and web proxy services. 
6.2.10.  For cloud services PPS, follow the guidance in the DISA Cloud Computing Security 
Requirements Guide and procedures on the DAF Cybersecurity Collaborative Environment 
(see Table A.2–URLs). 
6.2.11.  Information systems with a public component, a public-facing presence, or Internet-
facing applications require review and approval through the DoD DMZ whitelist process. 
Follow the guidance on the DAF Cybersecurity Collaborative Environment (see Table A.2–
URLs).

DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
6.3.  Ports, Protocols, and Services Management Registry.  The DoD PPSM operates two 
databases, one for unclassified systems (PPSM-U) and another for classified systems (PPSM-C). 
Upon registration, each information system/enclave registered in the DoD PPSM Registry receives 
a DoD PPSM Tracking Identifier as proof of registration, retained throughout the lifecycle of the 
system. Records in the DoD PPSM Registry remain valid according to the information 
system/enclave authorization termination date; system/enclave registration records are removed 
from the DoD PPSM Registry upon the authorization termination date expiration. 
6.4.  Ports, Protocols, and Services Declaration.  Implement PPS according to DoD PPS 
standards using the applicable DISA STIGs, DoD PPS Category Assurance List, DoD PPS 
Vulnerability Assessment reports, and DAF Component Local Service Assessments. (T-0). 
Additional requirements may be provided via JFHQ-DODIN, USCYBERCOM, and Sixteenth Air 
Force (Air Forces Cyber) tasking orders or other directives as situations arise. 
6.4.1.  Comply with CJCSI 6211.02D for “tunneling” across the AFIN and ensure declaration 
of the PPS to include PPS within the tunnel. (T-0). 
6.4.1.1.  Comply with the Approval to Connect process according to AFI 17-101. (T-2). 
6.4.1.2.  PPS documentation and associated PPS registration must declare the PPS required 
to establish the tunnel and also the PPS used within the tunnel pursuant to the purposes and 
applicability of DoDI 8551.01. (T-0). 
6.4.2.  PPS associated with information system connections by mission partners require 
compliance with DoDI 5530.03, International Agreements, and Approval to Connect guidance 
in AFI 17-101. 
6.4.2.1.  Mission partner information systems require a DoD PPSM Tracking Identifier for 
operation on, operation through (e.g., encrypted tunnels), and/or connection to the AFIN. 
For more information about mission partner environments, see DoDI 8110.01, Mission 
Partner Environment (MPE) Information Sharing Capability Implementation for the DoD. 
6.4.2.2.  Develop, maintain, and adhere to interconnection agreements or similar 
documents for the use of PPS within an enclave or hosting environment. (T-2). 
6.4.3.  Declare PPS on the Air Force PPSMBI workbook available in eMASS under the help 
menu. 
6.4.3.1.  Document all Internet Protocol-based communication interfaces utilizing a 
definable port and data service associated with hardware, software, and applications within 
the authorization boundary as listed in the applicable authorization documentation for the 
information system. 
6.4.3.2.  Do not document any Internet Protocol-based communications interfaces 
associated with hardware, software, and applications owned and declared by another 
authorized information system. 
6.5.  Ports, Protocols, and Services Registration.  Registration of PPS occurs after authorization 
of the system. Once registered, a PPSM Tracking Identifier is assigned to the information system 
and will substantiate system interconnections such as network changes, boundary modifications, 
and other connection authorizations throughout the information system lifecycle. 
6.5.1.  PPS registration is required for the following: 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
45 
6.5.1.1.  Any computer/device inside a Non-classified Internet Protocol Router 
Network/Secret Internet Protocol Router Network enclave with any communication 
interface external to the enclave or authorization boundary. 
6.5.1.2.  Any computer/device inside a Non-classified Internet Protocol Router 
Network/Secret Internet Protocol Router Network enclave with only internal (i.e., Local 
Only) communications interfaces to another computer/device inside that same enclave with 
no external communications interfaces outside the enclave or authorization boundary. 
6.5.1.3.  A computer/device inside an encrypted tunnel to communicate across a Non-
classified Internet Protocol Router Network to any other network including the Internet. 
6.5.1.4.  Any computer/device on the Internet connection to another computer inside a

the Internet connecting to any computer on the .mil domain. 
6.5.2.  PPS registration is not required for the following: 
6.5.2.1.  A computer/device on the Internet with another communications interface to 
another computer on the Internet (i.e., not on the DoD Information Network). 
6.5.2.2.  A computer/device that does not interface with the Non-classified Internet 
Protocol Router Network/Secret Internet Protocol Router Network. 
6.5.2.3.  A computer/device that does not reside on an Internet Protocol-based network. 
6.6.  Ports, Protocols, and Services Review.  Review mandated changes to PPS security 
measures (i.e., USCYBERCOM orders, DoD PPSM Configuration Control Board results) and 
determine impact, compliance, and remediation actions for the applicable PPS used by an 
information system. Document the findings as a security impact assessment, indicating the amount 
of residual risk any change either adds or removes. 
6.7.  Ports, Protocols, and Services Updates/Change Management.  PPS updates require a 
current authorization for the system and a DoD PPSM Tracking Identifier that indicates the system 
has been registered. Coordinate all updates, modifications, additions, and deletions through the 
system ISSM. See the Air Force Change Process guidance on MilSuite and the AF-PPS Wiki; 
URLs available at Table A.2. 
6.8.  Decommissioning Strategy.  Include PPS used by information systems within the system 
decommissioning strategy according to DoDI 8510.01. A decommissioning strategy must also 
include the removal of the information system from the DoD PPSM Registry, coordination with 
the Cybersecurity Service Provider and/or hosting environment to remove associated boundary 
protection device rules, and the termination of PPS exceptions for the system. (T-1).

DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
Chapter 7 
APPROVED MOBILE DEVICE 
7.1.  Individuals shall not place DoD Controlled Unclassified Information on a personal 
mobile device except as part of a SAF/CN AMD (formerly known as BYOAD) 
program.  AMD is a device- and Operating System-agnostic mobile solution that enables a user 
with a personally owned device to securely access government information while maintaining user 
privacy. Government information is maintained either in a managed container stored on the device 
or in a virtual machine within a Zero Trust, unmanaged, containerized app that keeps the user's 
personal data separate from government data. When using an unmanaged solution, the government 
cannot access the user's personal data and apps, and in the event of a spillage, the user's personal 
device does not have to be confiscated or wiped; it is just where the app displaying the virtual 
machine is installed. (T-1). To establish or locate an AMD program, DAF personnel should initiate 
the process through their respective WCO. 
7.2.  A SAF/CN-approved AMD program:  Will have EITHER a Mobile Device Management 
(MDM) technical solution that provides a Managed Mobile Service (MMS) OR a Zero Trust-based 
VMI solution, enabling user access to Unclassified DOD Information while ensuring separation 
from personal information, and when removed will not impact personal information. (T-1). If 
using an MDM solution, the MMS mandates personally-owned mobile devices that access DoD 
information and/or DoD IS: 
7.2.1.  Must be managed and configured IAW appropriate STIGs and Security 
Recommendation Guides, monitored by an MMS, and validated against appropriate NIAP 
Protection Profile(s). (T-0). 
7.2.2.  Must have an Authority to Operate (ATO) by an AO, accomplished per the requirements 
and process in AFI 17-101; see paragraph 1.3. Mobile devices and solutions without an ATO 
cannot be used until they obtain an ATO. (T-0). 
7.2.3.  Must ensure automated monitoring, compliance, and validation mechanisms are 
implemented by the MMS to ensure security/configuration settings of AMD do not deviate 
from the AO-approved configuration baseline and security controls (e.g., device 
configurations, approved OS versions, detection of rooted/jailbroken devices). (T-0). 
7.2.4.  Must validate and support malware detection, over-the-air (OTA) electronic software 
distribution of applications, remote data-wipe capabilities, remote device configuration 
management, plus asset/property management capabilities that protect against key and data 
compromise. (T-0). 
7.2.5.  Must monitor for violations of defined rules such as violations of application whitelists, 
Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) changes, and roaming state changes. (T-0). 
7.2.6.  Must validate the device is running the latest approved Operating System/patch. (T-1). 
Operations should send notices of approved patch levels, and the device must be updated to 
the latest OS/patch level within 30 calendar days of the notification. (T-1). 
7.2.7.  Must block access from any personal device that has failed to be patched/updated and 
any devices that are considered end-of-life and no longer receiving patches. (T-1). 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
47 
7.2.8.  Must have a process for approving devices and individuals to participate in the program. 
(T-1). 
7.2.9.  Must have the capability to provide reports on the number of users to SAF/CN every 
six months. (T-1). 
7.3.  The AMD program is:  Voluntary and for the employee's convenience, not a cost-saving 
measure. It is not a substitute for government devices, and employees cannot have both a device 
participating in the AMD program and a government device simultaneously, as this policy also 
aims to improve compliance with the Clinger-Cohen Act by reducing duplicative services. (T-0). 
7.4.  All Users who choose to participate in the program must comply with the terms of both 
the DAF Form 4433 and DAF Form 4394 User Agreements that are signed.  Failure to observe 
this paragraph (7.4) by military personnel is a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(UCMJ), Article 92(1), Failure to Obey Order or Regulation. Violations by civilian employees 
may result in administrative disciplinary action IAW DAFI 36-147 without regard to otherwise 
applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. Violations by contactor 
personnel may be handled according to applicable laws and the terms of the contract. (T-0). 
7.5.  All users must:  Follow the approved process for obtaining and deleting the MMS OR VMI 
solution as outlined by SAF/CN, including completing the user training. (T-0). 
7.6.  Failure to observe  the following 7.6 subparagraphs by military personnel is a violation of 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 92(1), Failure to Obey Order or Regulation. 
Violations by civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary action IAW DAFI 36-
147, without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related 
laws. Violations by contactor personnel may be handled according to applicable laws and the terms 
of the contract. (T-0).

that is validated and certified NIAP compliant or is both part of a pre-existing NIAP compliant 
device family and is undergoing NIAP product evaluation for trusted device status. (T-0). 
7.6.2.  Only the aforementioned devices may be used to participate in the AMD program to 
ensure the separation and protection of DOD information. Devices that fail to achieve trusted 
device NIAP-compliant status are not eligible for AMD program use. The NIAP Product 
Compliant List and NIAP Product in Evaluation List can be found at the NIAP website (see 
Table A.2–URLs). For the AMD VMI program, the list of approved mobile hardware devices 
and associated operating systems and Windows patch levels is updated frequently and is

Terms 
Air Force Information Network (AFIN)—The DAF provisioned portion of the Department of 
Defense Information Network (DoDIN). The AFIN is defined as the globally interconnected, end-
to-end set of Air Force information capabilities, and associated processes for collecting, 
processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on-demand to warfighters, 
policymakers, and support personnel, including owned, leased, and contracted communications 
and computing systems and services, software (including applications), data, security services, 
other associated services, and national security systems. The terms AF Network (AFNET) and AF 
Network-Secure (AFNET-S) are introduced to refer to the Air Force’s underlying Non-Secure 
Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secure Internet Protocol Router Network 
(SIPRNet). (AFPD 10-17 and AFI 10-1701). 
DAF IT—“ . . . is any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, used in 
the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, 
control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information; includes 
computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices 
necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the 
central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services 
(including support services, and related resources). IT is equipment used by the DoD directly or is 
used by a contractor under a contract with the DoD that requires the use of that equipment. IT does 
not include any equipment acquired by a federal contractor incidental to a federal contract.” 
(AFMAN 17-1402, paragraph 3.1.1). 
Authorized User—Any appropriately cleared individual with a requirement to access a 
Department of Defense information system in order to perform or assist in a lawful and authorized 
governmental function. Authorized users include Department of Defense employees, contractors, 
and guest researchers. (DoDM 8140.03). 
Classified information—See classified national security information. 
Classified Information Spillage—Security incident that occurs whenever classified data is spilled 
either onto an unclassified information system or to an information system with a lower level of 
classification or different security category. Spillage encompasses this term. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
59 
Classified Message Incident—A higher classification level of data is transferred to a lower 
classification level system/device via messaging systems (e.g., email, instant messaging, etc.). 
(DoDM5200.01v1_AFMAN16-1404v1). 
Classified national security information—Information that has been determined pursuant to 
Executive Order (E.O.) 13526 or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized 
disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form. (E.O. 13526) 
Clear—A method of sanitization by applying logical techniques to sanitize data in all user- 
addressable storage locations for protection against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques 
using the same interface available to the user; typically applied through the standard read and write 
commands to the storage device, such as by rewriting with a new value or using a menu option to 
reset the device to the factory state (where rewriting is not supported). (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Collaborative Computing—Applications and technology (e.g., whiteboarding, group 
conferencing) that allow two or more individuals to share information in real-time in an inter- or 
intra-enterprise environment. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Common Criteria—Governing document that provides a comprehensive, rigorous method for 
specifying security function and assurance requirements for products and systems. (CNSSI No. 
4009). 
Commercial Mobile Device—A subset of portable electronic devices as defined in DoDD 
8100.02 that provide one or more commercial wireless interfaces along with a compact user input 
interface (touch screen, miniature keyboard, etc.) and exclude portable electronic devices running 
a multi-user operating system (Windows operating system, Mac operating system, etc.). This 
definition includes, but is not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and e-readers. 
Computer security (COMPUSEC)—Measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of the information processed and stored by a computer. Term has been replaced 
by the term “cybersecurity”. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Countermeasures—Actions, devices, procedures, techniques, or other measures that reduce the 
vulnerability of an information system. Synonymous with security controls and safeguards. 
(CNSSI No. 4009). 
Controlled unclassified information (CUI)—Information the Government creates or possesses, 
or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or 
Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or 
dissemination controls. However, CUI does not include classified information or information a 
non-executive branch entity possesses and maintains in its own systems that did not come from, 
or was not created or possessed by or for, an executive branch agency or an entity acting for an 
agency. Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may require or permit safeguarding or 
dissemination controls in three ways: Requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the 
information but providing no specific controls, which makes the information CUI Basic; requiring 
or permitting agencies to control or protect the information and providing specific controls for 
doing so, which makes the information CUI Specified; or requiring or permitting agencies to 
control the information and specifying only some of those controls, which makes the information 
CUI Specified, but with CUI Basic controls where the authority does not specify. Note: The CUI 
categories and subcategories are listed in the CUI Registry. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
60 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
Cybersecurity—Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic 
communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and 
electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, 
integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Note: The term cybersecurity 
replaced the term information assurance (IA) in the DOD and most USG policy documents in 
2014.The term information assurance, in turn, previously replaced the terms information security 
and computer security in the same way. However, the terms information security and computer 
security are still used in the USG and elsewhere depending on scope and intent. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Cybersecurity—enabled Information Technology Product— A product or technology whose 
primary role is not security, but that provides security services as an associated feature of its 
intended operating capabilities. To meet the intent of Committee on National Security Systems 
Policy (CNSSP) 11, acquired CS-enabled products must be evaluated if the CS features are going 
to be used to perform one of the security services (availability, integrity, confidentiality, 
authentication, or nonrepudiation). Note: Examples include such products as security-enabled web 
browsers and screening and security-enabled messaging systems. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Cybersecurity IT product—A product or technology whose primary purpose is to provide 
security services (e.g., confidentiality, authentication, integrity, access control, nonrepudiation of 
data), correct known vulnerabilities, or provide layered defense against various categories of non-
authorized or malicious penetrations of information systems or networks. 
Cybersecurity Workforce—Personnel who secure, defend, and preserve data, networks, net-
centric capabilities, and other designated systems by ensuring appropriate security controls and

owner, whereby the classification of a properly sanitized storage device is downgraded to 
UNCLASSIFIED. (NSA/Central Security Service Policy Manual 9-12). 
Degauss—1. To reduce the magnetic flux to virtual zero by applying a reverse magnetizing field. 
Also called demagnetizing. (NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1). 2. Process for reducing the magnetization 
of a storage device to zero by applying a reverse (coercive) magnetizing force, rendering any 
previously stored data unreadable and unintelligible, and ensuring that it cannot be recovered by 
any technology known to exist. (NSA/Central Security Service Policy Manual 9-12). 
Demilitarized Zone—1. Perimeter network segment that is logically between internal and 
external networks. Its purpose is to enforce the internal network’s Information Assurance (IA) 
policy for external information exchange and to provide external, untrusted sources with restricted 
access to releasable information while shielding the internal networks from outside attacks. 2. A 
host or network segment is inserted as a “neutral zone” between an organization’s private network 
and the Internet. (NIST SP 800-45, Version 2, Guidelines on Electronic Mail Security). 3. An 
interface on a routing firewall that is similar to the interfaces found on the firewall’s protected 
side. Traffic moving between the demilitarized zone and other interfaces on the protected side of 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
61 
the firewall still goes through the firewall and can have firewall protection policies applied. (NIST 
SP 800-41, Rev. 1, Guidelines on Firewalls, and Firewall Policy). 
Destroy—A method of Sanitization that renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state-of-
the-art laboratory techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of 
data. (NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1). 
Department of Defense Information Network—The set of information capabilities and 
associated processes for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information 
on demand to warfighters, policymakers, and support personnel, whether interconnected or

production and use of mobile code (e.g., Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, VBScript). (NIST SP 800-53, 
Rev. 5). 
Mobile Device—A portable computing device that has a small form factor such that: 
it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical 
connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); possesses local, 
nonremovable/removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile 
devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the 
device to capture information, or built-in features that synchronize local data with remote 
locations. Examples include smartphones, tablets, and E-readers. Also known as a "portable 
computing device." Note: If the device only has storage capability and is not capable of 
processing or transmitting/receiving information, then it is considered a portable storage device, 
not a mobile device. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
National Security Systems— “. . . as defined in 44 U.S.C. § 3552, are telecommunications or 
information systems operated by or on behalf of the Federal Government, the function, 
operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to 
national security, command and control of military forces, equipment that is an integral part of a 
weapon or weapons system, or, is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence 
missions. National Security Systems do not include systems that are used for routine 
administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, and personnel management 
applications).” (AFMAN 17-1402, paragraph 3.1.2). 
Non-Enterprise Activated Commercial Mobile Device—A non-enterprise activated device is 
any Department of Defense mobile handheld device that is not connected at any time to a 
62 
DAFMAN17-1301  9 DECEMBER 2024 
Department of Defense network or enterprise, and does not process sensitive or classified 
Department of Defense data or voice communications. Sensitive data or information is defined as 
any Department of Defense data or information that has not been deemed as publicly releasable 
by a Department of Defense Public Affairs Officer. (Mobile Policy Security Requirements Guide 
Overview). 
Non-repudiation—Protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular 
action. Provides the capability to determine whether a given individual took a particular action 
such as creating information, sending a message, approving information, and receiving a message. 
(NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5). 
Overwriting—The process of writing data on top of the physical location of data stored on the 
media. (NIST SP 800-88, Rev. 1). 
Personally identifiable information—Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an 
individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or 
linkable to a specific individual. 
Portable storage device—A system component that can be inserted into and removed from a 
system, and that is used to store data or information (e.g., text, video, audio, and/or image data). 
Such components are typically implemented on magnetic, optical, or solid-state devices (e.g., 
floppy disks, compact/digital video disks, flash/thumb drives, external hard disk drives, and flash 
memory cards/drives that contain nonvolatile memory). (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Privilege—A right that, when granted to an entity, permits the entity access and/or authorization 
to an otherwise restricted object, state, or resource. Note: Privileges represent the authorized 
behavior of a subject. They are defined by an authority and embodied in policy or rules. (CNSSI 
No. 4009). 
Privileged account—A system account with authorizations of a privileged user. (CNSSI No. 
4009). 
Privileged user—A user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to have access to perform 
system control, monitoring, administration functions, or security-relevant functions that ordinary 
users are not authorized to perform. (CNSSI No. 4009). Privileged users have the same 
requirements as authorized users but have additional permissions to configure information 
assurance– enabled software products and systems. These users must hold baseline commercial 
certifications according to DoDM 8140.03 and be placed in unit manning documented positions 
that require privileged access. (DoDI 8500.01). 
Remanence—Residual information remaining on data media after clearing. See Clear (CNSSI 
No. 4009). 
Remote Access—The ability for an organization’s users to access its non-public computing 
resources from external locations other than the organization’s facilities. (NIST SP 800-46, Rev. 
2). 
Removable Media—Portable data storage medium that can be added to or removed from a 
computing device or network. Note: Examples include, but are not limited to: optical discs;

Removable media device—See portable storage device. 
Sanitization—See sanitize. 
Sanitize—1. A process to render access to target data on the media infeasible for a given level of 
effort. Clear, Purge, Damage, and Destroy are actions that can be taken to sanitize media. 2. The 
removal of extraneous or potentially harmful data (e.g., malware) within a file or other information 
container (e.g., network protocol packet). 3. The removal of information from the storage device 
such that data recovery using any known technique or analysis is prevented. Sanitization includes 
the removal of data from the storage device, as well as the removal of all labels, markings, and 
activity logs. The method of sanitization varies depending upon the storage device in question, and 
may include degaussing, incineration, shredding, grinding, embossing, etc. (CNSSI No. 4009). 
Sensitive Information—See controlled unclassified information. 
Spillage—Security incident that results in the transfer of classified information or Controlled
