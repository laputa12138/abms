SECTION 2:  RESPONSIBILITIES 
The DoD Component heads implement the procedures prescribed in this issuance and ensure that 
any supplemental guidance and procedures are in accordance with Part 286 of Title 32, CFR, and 
DoDD 5400.07. 
2.1 (Added)(AF) Responsibilities. The Air Force Chief Information Officer (SAF/CIO A6) 
has overall responsibility for the Air Force FOIA Program (FOIA). The Air Force FOIA 
Public Liaison (SAF/CIO A6XA) administers the procedures necessary to implement the 
Air Force FOIA Program, submits reports to Directorate for Oversight and Compliance 
(DO&C), and provides guidance and instructions to AF FOIA Requester Service Centers 
(RSCs).  Responsibilities of other Air Force elements follow. 
 
2.1.1.  (Added)(AF) SAF/GCA is the Air Force FOIA Appellate Authority, which makes 
final decisions on FOIA administrative appeals. AFLOA/JACL serves as legal advisor to 
the Air Force FOIA Appeal Authority.  
 
2.1.2.  (Added)(AF) AF/JA, through AF/JAA and base legal offices, and AFIMSC/JA, 
provides all required administrative legal reviews.  
 
2.1.3.  (Added)(AF) At the HQ USAF and Secretary of the Air Force level, Initial Denial 
Authority (IDA) are GS-15/O-6 or above.  
 
2.1.4.  Added)(AF) Outside of the HQ USAF and Secretary of the Air Force level, 
commanders or vice commanders appoint IDA’s within their organizations.  MAJCOM 
IGs and Directors of Inquiries (IGQ) appoint IDA’s within the IG for IG-held records.  An 
IDA is GS-13/O-4 or above.  
 
2.1.5.  (Added)(AF) FOIA Managers (through MAJCOM FOIA RSC) must notify 
SAF/CIO A6XA in writing of IDA position titles.  Send position titles only-no names.  
SAF/CIO A6XA provides SAF/IGQ a courtesy copy of correspondence designating IDA 
positions for IG records.  When the commander changes the IDA designee position, 
MAJCOM FOIA IDA managers will immediately advise SAF/CIO A6XA.  In the absence 
of the designated IDA, the individual filling/assuming the designated IDA’s Air Force duty 
position acts as the IDA. (T-1). 
 
2.1.6.  (Added)(AF) Installation/Agency commanders:  
 
2.1.6.1.  (Added)(AF) Comply with FOIA Library requirements by establishing 
FOIA home page on installation public websites, to include the FOIA RSC and AF FOIA 
Public Liaison contact information (organizational mailing and email address, and phone 
number), with a link to the Air Force FOIA web page, http://www.foia.af.mil and the 
Public Access Link to submit request online, https://www.efoia.milcloud/App/Home.aspx.

2.1.6.2.  (Added) (AF) Implement this instruction in their commands/agencies and 
appoint a FOIA Manager in writing (through MAJCOM FOIA RSC).  May appoint FOIA 
Monitor at the unit to serve as the Point of Contacts for the FOIA Managers to task the 
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) to locate records responsive to FOIA requests and 
respond to FOIA appeals.  Send the name, phone number, office symbol, and e-mail 
address of a FOIA Manager to SAF/CIO A6XA, 1800 Air Force Pentagon, Washington  
DC 20330-1800 or via e-mail to usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.af-foia@mail.mil. (T-1). 
2.1.6.3.  (Added)(AF) Assign legal review responsibilities for FOIA requested 
records.  Air Force attorneys will review and provide written legal reviews for all FOIA 
responses, as well as provide all legal advice to the OPR, disclosure authorities, Initial 
Denial Authorities and FOIA Managers.  Air Force attorneys ensure factual and legal 
issues raised by appellants are considered by the IDA prior to sending the FOIA appeal 
files to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designee for final action.  The responsibility for 
ensuring IDA’s consider factual and legal issues rests with either the IDA, OPR, or the 
FOIA Manager.  All attorney legal reviews will be documented to show hours and costs 
incurred and this information will be provided to the FOIA Managers. (T-1).   
2.1.6.4.  (Added)(AF) Ensure IDA’s apply the policies and guidance in this 
instruction, along with the written recommendations provided by staff elements, when

records are denied, the FOIA RSC, on behalf of the IDA, informs the requester in writing 
(response letters) of the nature of records or information denied, the FOIA exemption (see 
Section 5 for FOIA exemptions) supporting the denial, the reasons the records were not 
released, and gives the requester the appeal procedures.  In addition, on partial releases, 
FOIA RSC’s must ensure requesters can see the placement and general length of 
redactions with the applicable exemption indicated in Section 5. This procedure applies to 
all media, including electronic records. Providing placement and general length of redacted 
information is not required if doing so would harm an interest protected by a FOIA 
exemption. When working FOIA appeal actions for the appellate authority review:  
2.1.6.4.1.  (Added)(AF) Ensure that on appeals, prior to an appeal being 
forwarded to the Air Force appellate authority for final action, IDA’s review the appeal 
and grant or deny (in full or in part) the requester’s appeal of the earlier withholding of 
responsive records, or other adverse determination.  If the IDA does not grant the appeal 
in full as requested by the requester, that portion of the appeal not granted is forwarded to 
the Air Force Appeal Authority for final action. (T-1). 
 
2.1.6.4.2.  (Added)(AF) When an  IDA denies any appellate action sought by 
a FOIA requester, the  IDA, or FOIA Managers (for no record, fee, fee estimates, or fee 
category appeals) will indicate in writing that the issues raised in the FOIA appeal were 
considered and rejected (in full or in part).  Include this written statement in the file sent to 
the Secretary of the Air Force in the course of a FOIA appeal action.  Send all appeal 
actions through the MAJCOM FOIA RSC. (T-1).

issuance must establish one or more FOIA RSCs. 
(1). (Added)(AF) The Department of the Air Force provides a list of Air Force FOIA 
RSC and contact information that is available on the Air Force FOIA website at 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
17 
http://www.foia.af.mil.  Note, realignment of Air Force elements is frequent; addresses 
listed on the FOIA website are subject to change. 
(2). (Added)(AF) The Department of the Air Force does not have a central 
repository for Air Force records. FOIA requests are addressed to the appropriate Air 
Force RSC that support in processing the requests or has custody of the record desired. In 
answering inquiries regarding FOIA requests, Air Force RSC will assist requesters in 
determining the correct Air Force RSC to address their requests. If there is uncertainty as 
to the ownership of the record desired, refer the requester to the Air Force RSC that is 
most likely to have the record.  
b. 
Each FOIA RSC will have a website that serves to educate the public on the FOIA 
process.  These websites will comply with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8550.01.  At a minimum, 
each website will provide: 
(1)  The address, telephone number, facsimile number, and organizational e-mail address 
to which the public can send FOIA requests. 
(2)  Name of the DoD FOIA Program Component’s FOIA point of contact. 
(3)  A link to the DoD FOIA Handbook. 
(4)  A description of the types of records that can be requested from the DoD FOIA 
Program Component. 
(5)  The name and contact information for each of the DoD FOIA Program Component’s 
FOIA Public Liaisons. 
(6)  Information on how a FOIA requester can obtain the status of their FOIA request 
(either by telephone or through the FOIA RSC website). 
(7)  A FOIA library as described in Section 4 or a link to the DoD FOIA Program 
Component’s FOIA library, if the library is centralized. 
c.  The websites of DoD FOIA Program Component headquarters FOIA RSCs will link to the 
websites of the other FOIA RSCs within their Components. 
d.  The Internet home page of every DoD Component will link to the FOIA RSC for that 
DoD Component. 
e.  (Added)(AF) SAF/CIO A6XA will cover the requirements of section 3.3 on the Air 
Force FOIA website at http://www.foia.af.mil.  Each FOIA RSC is required to establish a 
FOIA home page on installation public websites, as outlined in paragraph 2.1.6.1. (T-1). 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
18 
3.4.  FOIA PUBLIC LIAISONS.  The DoD Components listed in Paragraph 3.2.a. will submit 
to the DO&C the names of personnel to serve as FOIA Public Liaisons.  Each DoD FOIA 
Program Component will have at least one FOIA Public Liaison.   
a.  The FOIA Public Liaisons will: 
(1)  Ensure that the FOIA RSCs’ websites comply with the requirements in Paragraph 
3.3.b. 
(2)  Assist in the reduction of any delays in responding to requests. 
(3)  Increase transparency and understanding of request statuses. 
(4)  Assist in dispute resolution. 
b.  The FOIA Public Liaison for the DoD Components listed in Paragraph 3.2.b., the 
OSD/JS, and the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals is in the DO&C. 
c.  (Add)(AF) SAF/CIO A6XA is the Air Force FOIA Public Liaison office. 
3.5.  UNOFFICIAL RELEASE OF DOD RECORDS.  Records are considered part of the 
public domain when released to the public in response to a FOIA request or under circumstances 
in which a DoD official with the appropriate authority has authorized their release (e.g., a release 
under the DoD Mandatory Declassification Review Program, pursuant to DoD 5230.30-M).  The 
disclosure of exempt records, without authorization by an appropriate DoD official, is not an 
official release of information.  Such a release does not waive the authority of the DoD to assert 
FOIA exemptions to withhold the same records in response to a FOIA request. 
3.6.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUESTED RECORD.  The requester is responsible for 
providing a reasonable description of the desired record that will enable the DoD Component to 
locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort.   
a.  A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-
random search for the record based on the DoD Component’s filing arrangements and existing 
retrieval systems.  If filing arrangement details are unknown, then the requester should provide 
sufficient event-related details, to include the circumstances that resulted in the record being 
created or the date and circumstances surrounding the event the record covers, to permit a person 
familiar with the DoD Component’s filing arrangements to reasonably identify where such 
records would be located.  The DoD Component’s decision on the reasonableness of the 
description must be based on knowledge of its files, not on the potential volume of records that 
may be located and the concurrent review effort to determine releasability.   
b.  The fact that a FOIA request appears broad or burdensome (e.g., contains a large volume 
of potentially responsive information) does not, by itself, entitle the DoD Component to deny the 
FOIA request on the grounds that it does not reasonably describe the record sought. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
19 
 c.  (Added)(AF) Air Force elements must make reasonable efforts to find the records 
described in FOIA requests.  Reasonable efforts means searching all activities and 
locations most likely to have the records, and includes staged or retired records, as well 
as complete and thorough searches of relevant electronic records, such as databases, 
word processing, and electronic mail files. (T-0). 
3.7.  COMBATANT COMMANDS.  The Combatant Commands’ FOIA programs are placed 
under OSD jurisdiction instead of the administering Military Department or the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff.  This is an exception to DoDD 5100.03 in that it authorizes and requires the 
Combatant Commands to process FOIA requests in accordance with Part 286 of Title 32, CFR, 
and this issuance. 
a.  Documents originated by the Military Service components of the Combatant Commands 
while acting in a headquarters capacity for joint exercises or operations under Combatant 
Command authority are joint in nature and are under the cognizance of the Combatant 
Commands. 
b.  Documents created for a Combatant Command, yet located within a Defense Criminal 
Investigative Organization or Military Department Counterintelligence Organization or accident 
investigation file at the Military Service component, are Military Service records and the release, 
initial denial, and appellate authorities remain with the Military Service.  However, the Military 
Service component will consult with the responsible Combatant Command during the review 
process. 
c.  Documents created by the Military Service components of the Combatant Commands 
below the headquarters level are considered Military Service records.  Examples would include 
base support, personnel, and logistical records. 
3.8.  SECURITY CLEARANCES AND ACCESS.  Due to the nature of their duties and 
responsibilities, FOIA personnel require access to all records requested through their respective 
activities, regardless of the sensitivity or classification of the information.  The DoD 
Components must ensure that FOIA personnel have the appropriate clearances and access to 
perform their duties and are provided the appropriate electronic equipment to process and 
transmit classified records. 
3.9.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOIA AND THE PRIVACY ACT.   
a.  Requesters seeking records about themselves contained only in a Privacy Act system of 
records will have their requests processed pursuant to Section 552a of Title 5, U.S.C. (also 
known as the “Privacy Act of 1974,” as amended, and referred to as the “Privacy Act” in this 
issuance) and implemented within the DoD by DoD 5400.11-R. 
(1)  If the Privacy Act system of records is exempt from the access provisions of Section 
(d)(1) of the Privacy Act, and if the records or any portion thereof are exempt pursuant to FOIA, 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
20 
the DoD Component will advise of the appropriate Privacy Act and FOIA exemption(s) in its 
response.  Appeals must be processed pursuant to both the FOIA and the Privacy Act. 
(2)  If the Privacy Act system of records is not exempt from the access provisions of 
Section (d)(1) of the Privacy Act, a DoD Component cannot claim a FOIA exemption on the 
information and must release all information to the first-party requester.  However, the DoD 
Component may withhold from such requester privacy-related information about another 
individual within the requester’s Privacy Act file.  When this is the case, the DoD Component 
will advise the first-party requester that information was withheld because “a portion of the 
record you requested contains privacy-related information about a party other than yourself.” 
b.  Requesters seeking records about themselves not in a Privacy Act system of records who 
cite or imply the Privacy Act will have their requests processed pursuant to the FOIA, since the 
Privacy Act does not apply to these records.  Appeals must be processed pursuant to the FOIA. 
c.  Requesters seeking records about themselves in a Privacy Act system of records and 
outside a Privacy Act system of records will have their requests processed pursuant to both the 
Privacy Act and the FOIA. 
d.  DoD Components will advise first-party requesters in the final response letter which 
Privacy Act and FOIA statutory authorities were used, inclusive of appeal rights. 
3.10.  USE OF CONTRACTORS IN FOIA ADMINISTRATION.  Pursuant to DoDI 
1100.22, Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, and Office of Federal 
Procurement Policy Letter 11-01, DoD Components may not use contract support for certain 
functions known as “inherently governmental activities” (e.g., “governmental FOIA functions”).  
a.  Inherently governmental FOIA functions include: 
(1)  Formulating or approving FOIA policies and procedures. 
(2)  Making final determinations regarding whether to treat an incoming correspondence 
as a FOIA or Privacy Act request. 
(3)  Making denial or release determinations of information requested pursuant to the 
FOIA. 
(4)  Deciding any issues regarding the scope or interpretation of a FOIA request. 
(5)  Determining the appropriateness of claimed exemptions. 
(6)  Approving the approach taken in negotiations or discussions with the FOIA 
requester. 
(7)  Deciding administrative appeals. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
21 
(8)  Conducting a final review of all outgoing final determination correspondence, 
memoranda, and release packages. 
(9)  Making final determinations on requests for expedited processing, fee category, and 
fee waivers. 
(10)  Executing documents for filing in litigation pursuant to the FOIA if the documents 
assert an official position of the DoD, any DoD Components, or any other federal agencies.  
Contractors may prepare and execute documents describing their own actions while processing 
FOIA requests. 
b.  Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 11-01 identifies the preparation of responses 
to FOIA requests as a function closely associated with inherently governmental functions.  
Examples of FOIA functions and duties that contractors may perform in the preparation of 
responses to FOIA requests include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Making redactions to documents under the direction of an initial denial authority 
(IDA). 
(2)  Preparing correspondence for signature by a U.S. Government official. 
(3)  Communicating with a FOIA requester concerning the status of the FOIA request. 
(4)  Recommending information to be denied. 
(5)  Entering relevant information into the DoD Component’s FOIA tracking system. 
3.11.  NON-RESPONSIVE INFORMATION.  It is not uncommon for a DoD Component, 
when processing records in response to a FOIA request, to locate records that deal with multiple 
subjects, and only one of these subjects pertain to the FOIA request.  In most of these cases the 
DoD Components should release non-responsive information that is not exempt from the FOIA.  
However, if it is determined that processing the non-responsive information may cause a burden 
to the DoD Component or is not in the best interests of the FOIA requester, the DoD Component 
will consult with the FOIA requester and seek their concurrence to the redaction of the non-
responsive information without a FOIA exemption.  If the FOIA requester agrees, the responsive 
record will contain the annotation “non-responsive” at this redaction, and this concurrence will 
be documented in the response letter.  For further information, consult the Department of Justice 
guidance on this topic at https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-oip-guidance-
determining-scope-foia-request 
3.12.  HONORING FORM OR FORMAT REQUESTS.   
a.  The DoD Components will make reasonable efforts to: 
(1)  Provide the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily 
reproducible in that form or format in the Component’s automated system. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
22 
(2)  Provide records in a form that is reasonably usable. 
(3)  Maintain records in forms and formats that are reproducible. 
b.  A record is not considered readily reproducible if the DoD Component does not have the 
reproduction capability or if significant resources must be expended to reproduce it into the 
requested format.  In responding to FOIA requests for records, the DoD Components will make 
reasonable efforts to search for records in electronic form or format if maintained in automated 
systems, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the 
automated systems.  The DoD Components will make such determinations on a case-by-case 
basis.   
3.13.  FOIA ANNUAL REPORT.  The DoD FOIA Annual Report to the United States 
Attorney General and the Director of Office of Government Information Services is mandated by 
Section (e)(1) of the FOIA and completed on a fiscal-year basis.  Due to the magnitude of the 
requested statistics and the need for accuracy, the DoD FOIA Program Components will track 
the annual report data as FOIA requests are processed.  This facilitates accurate compilation of 
the statistics in completing the report.  Each September, the DO&C provides instructions to the 
DoD FOIA Program Components concerning Component input for the annual report.  Using the 
current edition of DD Form 2564, “Annual Freedom of Information Act Report,” the DoD 
Components will forward their reports to the DO&C no later than October 31.  In turn, the 
DO&C submits a consolidated report to the Attorney General by February 1 of each year, and 
places a copy of this report in the FOIA section of the DoD Open Government Website. 
3.13.1 (Added)(AF) FOIA Managers (through MAJCOM FOIA RSC) and 
AFLOA/JACL must validate and consolidate the report for the fiscal year on DD Form 
2564, Annual Report Freedom of Information Act in eFOIA, and send to SAF/CIO A6XA 
by 15 October via e-mail.  AFLOA/JACL will prepare the appeals and litigation costs 
sections of the report.  SAF/CIO A6XA will submit a consolidated report to the DO&C and 
make the AF report available on the AF FOIA website. (T-1).  
3.14.  SIGNIFICANT FOIA REQUESTS.  DoD FOIA Program Components receiving a 
FOIA request for records, the release of which may be of interest to DoD leadership, will contact 
DO&C for further guidance.  DO&C will coordinate expeditiously the responses with DoD 
leadership; however, it will not act as the IDA for any denial of information. 
 
3.15.  (Added)(AF) A significant FOIA request is one where, in the Component’s judgment, 
the subject matter of the request/any releasable documents is or may generate media 
interest and/or may be of interest or potential interest to DoD senior leadership for other 
reasons, (i.e., a FOIA request involving a sexual assault, actions or conduct of Secretary of 
Air Force, Chief of Staff, etc.). Any requests involving the current administration, previous 
administrations, Members of Congress (correspondence, travel, or otherwise), or conduct 
of current or previous DoD senior leadership (Secretary), will always be considered a 
potentially significant FOIA request for which SAF/CIO A6XA is notified. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION :  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
23 
 
3.15.1. (Added)(AF) FOIA RSC will inform SAF/CIO A6XA immediately (through 
MAJCOM FOIA RSC) upon receipt of any significant FOIA request(s) received by the 
FOIA RSC.  Upon notification, SAF/CIO A6XA will determine whether HQ USAF and/or 
DoD/SAF-PA review is necessary prior to any release determination by the servicing IDA.  
If the package requires coordination, the FOIA RSC must send a copy of the proposed 
final release letter, a copy of the releasable documents (redacted), and a copy of the request 
letter.  Note, the case is not to be placed on hold at any time during the coordination 
process and FOIA Managers must not release the records until SAF/CIO A6XA informs 
that the case has been cleared for release. (T-1).

SECTION 4:  FOIA LIBRARIES 
24 
SECTION 4:  FOIA LIBRARIES 
4.1.  REQUIREMENTS.   
a.  General.  The FOIA requires agency records described in Section (a)(2) of the FOIA and 
created on or after November 1, 1996, to be available for public inspection in an electronic 
format.  To meet this requirement, each DoD FOIA Program Component will maintain an online 
FOIA library.  In addition to these records, the DoD FOIA Program Components may elect to 
place other agency records of public interest in their FOIA libraries. 
b.  DoD FOIA Program Component FOIA Libraries.  Each DoD Component will 
establish one or more FOIA libraries.  The DoD Components that have only one FOIA RSC will 
meet this requirement by having a FOIA library on its FOIA website.  The DoD Components 
with more than one FOIA RSC will meet this requirement by either having one FOIA library on 
its primary FOIA website or having a FOIA library on each FOIA RSC website.   
(1)  Final Opinions.  Section (a)(2)(A) of the FOIA requires agencies to make final 
opinions available to the public.  This requirement can be met by the public availability of DoD 
Component websites such as the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals and Armed Services 
Board of Contract Appeals.  DoD FOIA Program Components are not required to also post or 
link to these otherwise publically available documents in their FOIA libraries. 
(2)  Statements of Policy.  Section (a)(2)(B) of the FOIA requires agencies to make 
statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted by the agencies and are not 
published in the Federal Register available to the public.  This requirement can be met by the 
publication of DoD issuances on the DoD Issuances Website.  DoD FOIA Program Components 
are not required to post or link to these documents in their FOIA libraries. 
(3)  Administrative Staff Manuals or Instructions.  Section (a)(2)(C) of the FOIA requires 
agencies to make administrative staff manuals and instructions that establish policy or 
interpretations that affect the public available to the public.  Each DoD FOIA Program 
Component FOIA library must link to its respective Component’s publicly available issuance 
publication web page.  For example, the Air Force FOIA Website will link to the Air Force e-
Publishing Website, and the OSD/Joint Staff FOIA RSC will link to the DoD Issuances Website. 
(4)  Frequently Requested Records.   
(a)  Each FOIA Program DoD Component FOIA library must meet the requirements 
of Section (a)(2)(D) of the FOIA by making available to the public records that: 
1.  Have been released under the FOIA; and 
2.  Are or are likely to become the subject of subsequent FOIA requests; or 
3.  Have been requested three or more times. 
(b)  These types of documents will not be posted in FOIA Libraries. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 4:  FOIA LIBRARIES 
25 
1.  Documents requested by a person that would be exempt from release to any 
other requester pursuant to Exemptions 6 or 7(C) because they contain personally identifiable 
information about the requester.  This commonly occurs when a requester makes a first party 
request for their own information; however, it could arise in other situations. 
2.  Documents requested by a commercial entity that would be exempt from 
release to any other requester pursuant to Exemption 4 because they contain trade secrets or 
commercial or financial information concerning the requester. 
(5)  Index.  Section (a)(2)(E) of the FOIA requires the libraries to provide an index of the 
documents posted in accordance with Section (a)(2)(D).  DoD FOIA Program Components can 
meet this requirement by arranging these documents in their FOIA libraries by topical or 
descriptive words, rather than by case name or numbering system, so that the public can readily 
locate material.  Case name and numbering arrangements may also be included for DoD FOIA 
Program Component convenience. 
(6)  Proactive Releases.  DoD FOIA Program Components may post other documents in 
their FOIA libraries, such as proactive releases, documents released in accordance with the 
Mandatory Declassification Review program, and other documents released in accordance with 
the FOIA.  This section also may contain links to other DoD FOIA Program Component offices 
proactively releasing documents.  DoD Components must not proactively release documents that 
are contained within a Privacy Act system of records unless the published system of records 
notice specifically allows for proactive releases in the routine uses section. 
c.  Exemptions.  DoD FOIA Program Components will redact from all records in FOIA 
libraries all information that qualifies for withholding pursuant to one or more of the FOIA 
exemptions described in Section 5. 
d. (Add)(AF) SAF/CIO A6XA will make the traditional (a)(2) materials (Title 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(2)(A), (B), (C) and (D)) available to the public on the Air Force FOIA Library 
website.  Each FOIA RSC must make Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D) records available to the 
public in a Library by sending it to SAF/CIO A6XA for posting via eFOIA.  (T-1).  
SAF/CIO A6XA will determine whether or not the release records are qualified for posting 
to the Air Force FOIA Library website.  
e. (Add)(AF) FOIA RSCs will consider any requested record that has been previously 
partially or fully released as a frequently requested record (FOIA - processed (a)(2)(D) 
record) and make it publicly available electronically as outlined in paragraph 4.1.b.(4).  (T-
1).  Posted records must be redacted in a manner where anyone in the world may have 
access to that record except for senior official (above the O-6 grade or civilian equivalent) 
investigative Inspector General report that were substantiated against the senior official. 
(T-1).  FOIA records requested only by a first party requester for their own Privacy Act 
records will NOT be posted to the Library. (T-0).

4.2.  RECORD AVAILABILITY.  The DoD FOIA Program Components should consider 
enhancing their FOIA libraries with search engines and document categories to provide the 
public easier access.  
4.3.  INDEXES.  Sections (g)(1) and (2) of the FOIA require agencies to make available for 
public inspection in an electronic format an index of all major information systems and a 
description of major information and record locator systems publicly available. 
a.  Major Information System.  The FOIA section of the DoD Open Government Website 
satisfies this requirement for the DoD.  The DoD FOIA Program Components are not required to 
post or link to this index in their FOIA libraries. 
b.  Record Locator System.  The FOIA section of the DoD Open Government Website 
satisfies this requirement for the DoD.  The FOIA Program DoD Components are not required to 
post or link to this index in their FOIA libraries. 
4.4.  FOIA SECTION (A)(1) RECORDS.   
a.  Although FOIA Section (a)(1) records need not be made available in response to FOIA 
requests or in FOIA libraries, they must be made publicly available.  Examples of (a)(1) records 
include: 
(1)  Descriptions of an agency’s central and field organization and, to the extent they 
affect the public, rules of procedure.  
(2)  Descriptions of forms available.  
(3)  Instructions as to the scope and contents of papers, reports, or examinations.  
(4)  Any amendments, revisions, or reports of the aforementioned records. 
b.  In accordance with Section (a)(1) of the FOIA, each DoD Component will disclose,

SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
5.1.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.   
a.  This section is not a thorough or exhaustive explanation of the applicability of the FOIA 
exemptions.  For more detailed explanations, the DoD Components may consult the Department 
of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act (available at http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia-
guide.html).  
b.  Information responsive to a FOIA request will be withheld only if the DoD Component 
reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one or more of the FOIA 
exemptions, or disclosure is prohibited by law.  Under this standard, the content of a particular 
record should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the DoD Component 
reasonably foresees that disclosing it, given its age, content, and character, would harm an 
interest protected by the applicable exemption.  Mere speculative or abstract fears, or fear of 
embarrassment, are an insufficient basis for withholding information. 
c.  As described in this section, nine types of exempt information in records may be withheld, 
in whole or in part, from public disclosure unless otherwise prescribed by law.  In general, a 
release of a record to one FOIA requester prevents the withholding of the same record pursuant 
to a FOIA exemption if the record is later requested by someone else. 
d.  In applying exemptions, the identity of the FOIA requester and the purpose for the FOIA 
request are irrelevant; however, an exemption may not be invoked when the particular interest to 
be protected is the FOIA requester’s interest.  For example, privacy information concerning an 
individual would not be withheld from that individual if they were to request it under the FOIA 
unless another FOIA exemption applies. 
e.  When a DoD Component determines that information contained within a record is exempt 
from release, it will consider whether a partial release of the record is possible by taking 
reasonable steps to conduct a line-by-line review to segregate and release nonexempt information 
contained within the record. 
f.  If admitting the fact of the existence or nonexistence of a record responsive to a FOIA 
request would itself reveal information protected from release by one of the nine exemptions, the 
DoD Components must neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of the requested 
record. 
(1)  This is commonly called a “Glomar” response (for detailed guidance on using this 
type of response, see the Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act), and 
the appropriate exemption must be cited by the DoD Component in the response.  This situation 
most commonly arises with Exemptions 1, 6, and 7(C); however, it could arise with other 
exemptions. 
(2)  A “refusal to confirm or deny” response must be used consistently by the DoD 
Components, not only when a record exists, but also when a record does not exist.  If not used 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
28 
consistently, the pattern of a “no record” response when a record does not exist, and a “refusal to 
confirm or deny” when a record does exist, risks disclosing exempt information. 
5.2.  APPLYING THE FOIA EXEMPTIONS.  This paragraph describes the nine types of 
exempt information in records and the procedures for applying them. 
a.  Exemption 1.  Pursuant to section (b)(1) of the FOIA, records properly and currently 
classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, pursuant to an existing Executive 
order, are exempt from disclosure.  If the responsive information is not marked as classified 
when the FOIA request is submitted, the DoD Component may undertake a classification review 
in accordance with Volume 1 of DoDM 5200.01 to determine whether the information should be 
classified.  The FOIA requester will be advised as to which sections of an Executive order apply 
in determining that the information is classified.  Exemption 1 also is invoked when: 
(1)  Individual items of unclassified information, when compiled, reveal additional 
associations or relationships that meet the standard for classification pursuant to an existing 
Executive order and Volume 1 of DoDM 5200.01, and are not otherwise revealed in the 
individual items of information.  This is known as the “mosaic” or “compilation” approach. 
(2)  The fact of the existence or nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal 
information containing classified information.  In this situation, the DoD Components must 
provide a Glomar response and cite Exemption 1. 
(3) (Add)(AF) No FOIA classified release decision should be made without the FOIA 
package containing the recommendation/ decision on declassification of the requested classified 
record completed by proper Air Force authority. Prior to forwarding to the FOIA IDA for a 
final release decision, declassification reviews of FOIA requested classified documents will 
follow the procedures in AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program and DoDM 
5200.01, DoD Information Security Program, as well other applicable regulation.  Further, AFI 
16-1404, paragraph 3.5.3., states that if an Air Force organization that was responsible for 
classifying an historical document no longer exists, the organization that inherited the function 
of the originating organization will determine appropriate declassification action. If the 
functions of the originating organization were dispersed to more than one organization, it 
cannot be determined which organization should inherit the function, or the organizations 
ceased to exist, the Air Force Declassification Office works with the Senior Agency Official 
(SAF/AA) to determine the declassification action to be taken. (T-1). 
b.  Exemption 2.  Pursuant to section (b)(2) of the FOIA, records related solely to the 
internal personnel rules and practices of the DoD or any of the DoD Components are exempt 
from disclosure.  
c.  Exemption 3.  Pursuant to section (b)(3) of the FOIA, records concerning matters that 
another statute specifically establishes criteria for withholding are exempt from disclosure.   
(1)  This exemption allows for the withholding of information because its release is 
prohibited by another statute only if one of two disjunctive requirements concerning the statute is 
met: 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
29 
(a)  The statute requires that the information be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or 
(b)  The statute establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular 
types of matters to be withheld.   
(2)  For any statute enacted after October 28, 2009, in order to qualify as an Exemption 3 
statute under this paragraph, it must cite to section (b)(3) of the FOIA.  The DO&C maintains a 
list of Exemption 3 information and statutes used within the DoD on the FOIA section of the 
DoD Open Government Website, including, but not limited to: 
(a)  Personally Identifying Information of DoD Personnel.  Section 130b of Title 10, 
U.S.C., authorizes the withholding of names, ranks, duty addresses, official titles, and pay 
information of DoD personnel (civilian and military) in overseas, sensitive, or routinely 
deployable units when this information is requested pursuant to the FOIA.  The United States 
Special Operations Command and the United States Cyber Command and their components 
qualify as sensitive units pursuant to Section 130b of Title 10, U.S.C.  Information withheld 
pursuant to Exemption 3 and this statute also should be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6.  
1. The DoD Components may make discretionary releases of names and duty 
information of personnel in overseas, sensitive, or routinely deployable units who, by the nature 
of their position and duties, frequently interact with the public.  Officials whose identities may be 
released include general and flag officers, public affairs officers, other personnel designated as 
official command spokespersons, and other senior officials whose identities are known to the 
public through the performance of their duties. 
(a)  (Added)(AF) Each Air Force installation will establish a system and 
assign an OPR to identify United States-based units qualifying for the “sensitive or 
routinely deployable unit” designation, under this exemption.  Appropriate OPR could 
include directors of operations, plans and programs, and personnel. (T-1). 
 
(b)  (Added)(AF) FOIA Managers will ensure the list of sensitive and 
routinely deployable units is reviewed in January and July, and validate the current list or 
provide a revised listing based on the current status of deployed units at that time to 
SAF/CIO A6XA through MAJCOM FOIA RSC.  FOIA RSC will use it to determine the 
units to which 10 U.S.C. 130b applies for the purpose of asserting Exemption 3. (T-1). 
2.  The provision in Paragraph 5.2.c.(2)(a), does not change DoD issuances for 
public affairs officers and the rules used by public affairs offices to release information to the 
general public and the media.  Public affairs offices should continue to release information in 
accordance with current DoD issuances, Privacy Act restrictions, and security classifications.  
(b)  Sensitive Information of Foreign Governments and International Organizations.  
Section 130c of Title 10, U.S.C., authorizes the withholding of unclassified sensitive information 
of a foreign government or international organization (e.g., the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, the United Nations, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the Inter-
American Defense Board, or the International Committee of the Red Cross).  DoD Component 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
30 
IDAs must withhold this information pursuant to Exemption 3 (for procedural instructions, see 
Paragraph 6.2.f.(2)) when they make all three of these determinations concerning the requested 
information: 
1.  The information was provided to the DoD by (or produced in cooperation 
with) a foreign government or international organization. 
2.  The information is withheld from public disclosure by the foreign government 
or international organization and the foreign government or international organization has made 
this representation in writing. 
3.  Any of these three conditions are met: 
a.  The foreign government or international organization requests, in writing, 
that the information be withheld. 
b.  The foreign government or international organization provides the 
information to the U.S. Government on the condition that it is not released to the public. 
c.  DoD regulations specify the release of the requested information would 
have an adverse effect on the ability of the U.S. Government to obtain the same or similar 
information in the future. 
(c)  Critical Infrastructure Security Information (CISI).  In accordance with Section 
130e of Title 10, U.S.C., the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Administration (DA), 
Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer, may exempt CISI from release under the FOIA.  
The s asserting the exemption must obtain a written determination from the DA in accordance 
with the procedures in Paragraph 6.2.j. before withholding CISI from a FOIA requester.  If the 
IDA asserting the exemption is from a consulted DoD Component, that DoD Component must 
obtain the written DA determination before responding to an closing the consultation. 
(d)  Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) System Data File.  In 
accordance with Section 2254a of Title 10, U.S.C., the Secretary of Defense and the DA may 
exempt MFOQA system data files from release under the FOIA.  The IDAs asserting the 
exemption must obtain a written determination from the DA in accordance with the procedures 
in Paragraph 6.2.j. before withholding MFOQA system data file information from a FOIA 
requester. 
d.  Exemption 4.  Pursuant to Section (b)(4) of the FOIA, certain non-government financial 
information is exempt from disclosure. 
(1)  This exemption protects: 
(a)  Trade secrets; or 
(b)  Information that is: 
1.  Commercial or financial; 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
31 
2.  Obtained from a person or entity outside of the U.S. Government; and 
3.  Privileged or confidential. 
(2)  Commercial or financial information that is voluntarily submitted to the U.S. 
Government, absent any exercised authority prescribing criteria for submission, may be 
categorically protected, provided it is not customarily disclosed to the public by the submitter.  
Examples of exercised authorities prescribing criteria for submission include statutes, Executive 
orders, regulations, invitations for bids, requests for proposals, and contracts.  DoD Components 
should analyze submission of information pursuant to these authorities in accordance with Part 
286 of Title 32, CFR. 
(3)  Commercial or financial information that is not voluntarily provided to the U.S. 
Government is considered “confidential” for Exemption 4 if its disclosure is likely to: 
(a)  Impair the U.S. Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the 
future (known as the “impairment prong”); 
(b)  Harm an identifiable private or governmental interest; or 
(c)  Cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person providing the 
information. 
(4)  Examples of information that may be protected by Exemption 4 include: 
(a)  Commercial or financial information received in connection with loans, bids, 
contracts, or proposals. 
(b)  Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract 
performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures. 
(c)  Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or audits. 
(d)  Financial data provided by private employers in connection with locality wage 
surveys that are used to fix and adjust pay schedules applicable to the prevailing wage rate of 
DoD employees. 
(e)  Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments concerning technical or 
scientific data or other information submitted with applications for research grants or with a 
report while research is in progress. 
(f)  Technical or scientific data developed by a contractor or subcontractor 
exclusively at private expense, or developed in part with federal funds and in part at private 
expense.  The contractor or subcontractor must retain legitimate proprietary interests in such 
data, in accordance with Sections 2320 and 2321 of Title 10, U.S.C., and Parts 227.71 and 
227.72 of Title 48, CFR.  Technical data developed exclusively with federal funds may be 
withheld pursuant to Exemption 3 if it meets the criteria of Section 130 of Title 10, U.S.C., and 
Parts 227.71 and 227.72 of Title 48, CFR. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
32 
(g)  Information copyrighted pursuant to Section 106 of Title 17, U.S.C., if release of 
copyrighted material otherwise meets the standards of Exemption 4. 
(5)  When the DoD Components receive FOIA requests for information that could be 
protected by this exemption, they will notify the submitter of the information in accordance with 
the procedures in Subpart 286.10 of Title 32, CFR. 
e.  Exemption 5.  Pursuant to Section (b)(5) of the FOIA, inter- or intra-agency memoranda 
or letters containing information considered privileged in civil litigation are exempt from 
disclosure.  Merely being an internal record is an insufficient basis for withholding pursuant to 
this exemption.  To qualify as exempt pursuant to Exemption 5, the document must meet a 
particular threshold and must be privileged in the civil discovery context. 
(1)  Threshold.  A document must meet the threshold requirement of being an inter- or 
intra-agency document before the proper privilege can be identified in any given case.  Because 
the U.S. Government may seek expert advice from external entities (or consultants) in many 
instances, it is possible that an external entity may qualify as an “agency” for this exemption.  
See the Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act for further discussion on 
this subject. 
(2)  Privileges.  The privileges and types of information protected by Exemption 5 
include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  Deliberative Process Privilege.  
1.  To qualify for this privilege, the information must be deliberative and pre-
decisional.  DoD Components cannot withhold factual information from a FOIA requester 
pursuant to this privilege, except when: 
a.  The author of a document deliberately selects specific facts out of a larger 
group of facts and uses only this subset of facts to make a decision, thereby revealing the 
author’s internal thought processes; or 
b.  The factual information is so inextricably connected to the deliberative 
material that its disclosure would expose or cause harm to the agency’s deliberations. 
2.  A direction or order from a superior to a subordinate usually does not qualify 
as a deliberative process document if it constitutes guidance on a departmental policy or a 
decision.  However, correspondence from a superior to a subordinate may qualify if it discusses 
preliminary matters or requests information or advice relied upon in the decision-making 
process. 
3.  An agency’s final decision and post-decisional documents related to the 
decision cannot be withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege. 
4.  Examples of deliberative process documents include: 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
33 
a.  Staff papers, including after-action reports, inspection reports, lessons 
learned, and situation reports containing staff evaluations, advice, opinions, or suggestions. 
b.  Advice, suggestions, or evaluations prepared on behalf of the DoD by 
individual consultants or by internal boards, committees, councils, groups, panels, conferences, 
commissions, task forces, or other similar groups that are formed for obtaining advice and 
recommendations. 
c.  Drafts of final records. 
d.  Information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative nature, or such 
matters as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise acquire and dispose of materials, real 
estate, facilities, or functions, when such information would provide undue or unfair competitive 
advantage to private personal interests or would impede legitimate U.S. Government functions. 
e.  Agency documents underlying the President’s budget decisions, as 
described in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11.  This includes planning, 
programming, and budgetary information that is involved in the defense planning and resource 
allocation process and out-year discretionary data. 
5.  The deliberative process privilege does not apply to records created 25 years or 
more prior to the date of the FOIA request. 
(b)  Attorney-Client Privilege.  This privilege protects confidential communications 
between an attorney and a client (or multiple clients that share a common interest) relating to 
legal matters for which the client has sought professional advice.  The information that the client 
supplies to the attorney, the legal advice that the attorney gives to the client in return, and 
communications between attorneys that involve client-supplied information are protected by this 
privilege.  Unlike the deliberative process privilege, the attorney-client privilege mandates the 
withholding of all the information, including the facts, unless the client waives the privilege. 
(c)  Attorney Work Product Privilege.  This privilege protects documents prepared by 
an attorney or at an attorney’s direction in reasonable anticipation of litigation.  Unlike the 
deliberative process privilege, the attorney work product privilege mandates the withholding of 
all the information, including the facts.  This privilege still can be used after the litigation is 
complete. 
(d)  Government Trade Secret Privilege.  This privilege protects trade secrets or other 
confidential research, development, or commercial information owned by the U.S. Government, 
premature release of which is likely to affect the U.S. Government’s negotiating position or other 
commercial interest. 
(e)  Safety Investigation Privilege.  This privilege protects privileged safety 
information, as defined in DoDI 6055.07. 
(f)  Presidential Communications Privilege.  This privilege protects communications 
among the President and Presidential advisors created to assist the President in the exercise of 
non-delegable constitutional duties. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
34 
f.  Exemption 6.  Pursuant to Section (b)(6) of the FOIA, information in personnel and 
medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy, is exempt from disclosure.  If the information qualifies as 
Exemption 6 information, there is no discretion in its release. 
(1)  When considering applying this exemption, the DoD Component must balance the 
public interest in disclosure against the individual’s privacy interest.  When there is no public 
interest in the requested information, the DoD Component may withhold the information even if 
there is only a negligible privacy interest.  In determining the public interest, the DoD 
Component should only consider whether the information sheds light on the operations or 
activities of the U.S. Government.  The FOIA requester has the burden of showing a public 
interest in disclosure. 
(2)  A privacy interest may exist in personal information even though the information was 
previously disclosed but may no longer be in the public’s eye and has faded from memory.  This 
is known as the concept of “practical obscurity.”  In this case, the privacy interest in this type of 
situation may have increased over time and the public interest may have decreased over time; 
therefore, the DoD Component should now withhold the once-public information, if the balance 
of interests has shifted in favor of privacy. 
(3)  This exemption usually protects home addresses, telephone numbers, and private 
e-mail addresses.  This includes home addresses and military quarters addresses not associated 
with the occupants’ names. 
(4)  This exemption must not be used in an attempt to protect the privacy of a deceased 
person.  It may be used to protect the privacy of the deceased person’s surviving family members 
if disclosure would rekindle grief, anguish, pain, embarrassment, or result in a disruption of their 
peace of mind.   
(5)  This exemption also applies when the fact of the existence or nonexistence of a 
responsive record would itself reveal information containing a privacy interest, and the public 
interest in disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest.  In this situation, the DoD 
Components must provide a Glomar response and cite Exemption 6. 
(6)  If a FOIA requester requests information that is about that FOIA requester, 
Exemption 6 may not be used to deny privacy information about that individual.  However, if 
another FOIA requester requests the same information, it should be denied under Exemption 6. 
g.  Exemption 7.  Pursuant to Section (b)(7) of the FOIA, records or information compiled 
for law enforcement purposes are exempt from disclosure upon the identification of one of the 
six conditions delineated in this paragraph.  Law enforcement purposes include civil, criminal, 
military, and regulatory/administrative purposes, including the implementation of Executive 
orders or regulations issued pursuant to law.  A DoD Component may invoke this exemption to 
prevent disclosure of documents not originally created, but later gathered, for law enforcement 
purposes. 
(1)  Conditions Where Exemption 7 Applies. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
35 
(a)  Exemption 7(A).  Section (b)(7)(A) of the FOIA applies to records compiled for 
law enforcement purposes when disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with 
enforcement proceedings.  Determining the applicability of Exemption 7(A) requires a two-step 
analysis. 
1.  DoD Components must identify an ongoing, pending, or prospective law 
enforcement proceeding.  This would include any subsequent or pending proceedings resulting 
from the original proceeding.  This exemption cannot be used if an investigation is terminated or 
complete. 
2.  DoD Components must determine whether release of the information could 
cause some articulable harm to the law enforcement proceeding.  In order to satisfy the 
“articulable harm” requirement of Exemption 7(A), there must be some distinct harm that could 
reasonably be expected to result if the record or information requested were disclosed. 
(b)  Exemption 7(B).  Section (b)(7)(B) of the FOIA applies to records compiled for 
law enforcement purposes when disclosure would deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or to 
an impartial adjudication. 
(c)  Exemption 7(C).  Section (b)(7)(C) of the FOIA applies to records compiled for 
law enforcement purposes when disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of a living person, including surviving family 
members of an individual identified in such a record.  This exemption also applies when the fact 
of the existence or nonexistence of a responsive record would itself reveal information 
containing a privacy interest, and the public interest in disclosure does not outweigh the privacy 
interest.  In this situation, the DoD Components must provide a Glomar response and cite 
Exemption 6. 
(d)  Exemption 7(D).  Section (b)(7)(D) of the FOIA applies to records compiled for 
law enforcement purposes when disclosure could reasonably be expected to disclose: 
1.  The identity of a confidential source, including: 
a.  A source within the DoD; 
b.  A State, local, or foreign agency or authority; or 
c.  Any private institution that furnishes the information on a confidential 
basis. 
2.  Information furnished from a confidential source and obtained by a criminal 
law enforcement authority in a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation. 
(e)  Exemption 7(E).  Section (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA applies to records compiled for 
law enforcement purposes when disclosure would reveal: 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 5:  EXEMPTIONS 
36 
1.  Non-obvious techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or 
prosecutions; or  
2.  Guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, if such 
disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. 
(f)  Exemption 7(F).  Section (b)(7)(F) of the FOIA applies to records compiled for 
law enforcement purposes when disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or 
physical safety of any individual. 
(2)  Examples of Exemption 7 Applications. 
(a)  Statements of witnesses and other material developed during the course of an 
investigation and all materials prepared in connection with related government litigation or 
adjudicative proceedings may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Exemptions 7(A), 7(C), and 
7(D). 
(b)  The identity of firms or individuals being investigated for alleged irregularities in 
contracting with the DoD, when the United States has obtained no indictment or filed any civil 
action against them, may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Exemptions 7(A) and 7(C). 
(c)  Information obtained in confidence, expressed or implied, during a criminal 
investigation by a criminal law enforcement activity or a lawful national security intelligence 
investigation may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Exemptions 7(A), 7(C), and 7(D).  
National security intelligence investigations include background security investigations and 
those investigations conducted to obtain affirmative or counterintelligence information. 
(d)  Emergency action plans, guidelines for response to terrorist attacks, analyses of 
security procedures, and other sensitive information that could prove deadly if obtained by those 
seeking to do harm to the public on a large scale may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to 
Exemptions 7(E) and 7(F). 
h.  Exemption 8.  Pursuant to Section (b)(8) of the FOIA, records in or related to 
examination, operation, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of any 
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions are exempt from 
disclosure. 
i.  Exemption 9.  Pursuant to Section (b)(9) of the FOIA, records containing geological and 
geophysical information and data (including maps) concerning wells are exempt from disclosure.

SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
37 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
6.1.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.   
a.  Requests From Private Parties.  A FOIA request may be made by any person.  It may 
not be used by federal agencies seeking official information.  
b.  Requests From Local or State Government Officials, Congress, and Foreign 
Governments. 
(1)  Local or State government officials, foreign officials requesting on behalf of their 
governments, foreign individuals, or foreign organizations requesting DoD Component records 
pursuant to the FOIA are treated the same as any other FOIA requester. 
(2)  The FOIA does not apply to the records of a DoD Component that is an element of 
the intelligence community, as defined in Section 401a(4) of Title 50, U.S.C., if the FOIA 
request is from an entity or representative of a foreign government. 
(3)  Requests from members of Congress who are not seeking records on behalf of a 
congressional committee or subcommittee, or on behalf of the House of Representatives or the 
Senate sitting as a whole, are not FOIA requests and should not be processed through FOIA 
channels.  However, any release of information will be consistent with a release to any individual 
pursuant to the FOIA and its withholding exemptions.  In these cases, the member will not be 
provided with FOIA appeal rights. 
(4)  Requests submitted by members of Congress on behalf of a congressional committee 
or subcommittee, or on behalf of the House of Representatives or the Senate sitting as a whole, 
that are received by a FOIA RSC are referred to the appropriate office that handles legislative 
inquiries for processing pursuant to DoDI 5400.04 or supplementing DoD Component issuances.  
Such requests are not processed pursuant to the FOIA and withholding exemptions may not 
apply. 
(5)  If a member of Congress chooses to request records pursuant to the FOIA, then the 
provisions of Part 286 of Title 32, CFR, and this issuance apply. 
(6)  Constituent requests for records that are forwarded by members of Congress are 
processed as FOIA or Privacy Act requests, as applicable.  The member forwarding the request 
will be advised of these circumstances. 
(7)  Requests from officials of foreign governments that do not invoke the FOIA are 
referred by the FOIA RSC to the appropriate office authorized to disclose official DoD 
information to foreign governments, and the requester is so notified. 
(8)  (Added)(AF) Requests for records from individual members of Congress are not 
normally processed formally under the FOIA (i.e., assigned a FOIA number with 
subsequent appeal rights), but are responded to by applying FOIA procedures consistent 
with this Manual and AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress.

(9)  (Added)(AF) Air Force-affiliated requesters, to include military and civilian 
employees, do not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or 
official mail channels to make FOIA requests. Doing so creates confusion as to whether or 
not the request is a personal FOIA request or a functional request.  Requests made by an 
organization or business must provide a name of their representative when submitting a 
request. (T-1). 
(10)  (Added)(AF) Requests that do not cite the FOIA are also known as 
“functional” requests. Air Force elements may receive requests for government 
information or records from the public that do not refer to the FOIA. Often these requests 
are sent to a Public Affairs Office (PAO), legislative affairs or a specific unit by the media. 
All releases of information from Air Force records to the public, whether the requester 
cites the FOIA or not, must comply with the principles of the FOIA exemptions.  When 
responding to requests that do not refer to the FOIA, if the responding element fully or 
partially denies the release of information from Air Force records, inform the requester of 
the basis for the denial of information but do not formally assert FOIA exemptions.  For 
example, if redacting personal information, state that information of individuals is 
redacted to protect personal information that, if released, would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In the event the requester asks about how to 
contest the withholding of the information, advise the person that a formal FOIA request 
can be filed through the appropriate FOIA RSC. (T-1). 
 
(11)  (Added)(AF) FOIA Managers are highly recommended to inform the requester of 
the option to accept “clearly releasable” records and define its meaning. Explain to the 
requester any information that will be withheld in compliance with the principles of the FOIA 
exemptions in order to expedite processing. Document if a requester states they will accept 
“clearly releasable” records. The response letter should inform the requester the basis for the 
denial of information but do not formally assert FOIA exemptions. For example, if redacting 
personal information, state that information of individuals is redacted to protect personal 
information that, if released, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy. The redacted portions of responsive documents are removed without listing the 
exemption codes. This process does not require IDA approval or legal review and will be 
considered a full release.  In the event the requester asks about how to contest the withholding 
of the information, remind the requester in writing of their appeal rights. 
6.2.  PROCESSING PROCEDURES. 
a.  Receipt and Control.   
(1)  When a FOIA RSC receives a FOIA request, it must open a file in a formal control 
system.  The formal control system: 
(a)  Must be designed for accountability and compliance with the FOIA. 
(b)  Should include the data elements necessary to compile the statistics required by 
the annual report. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
39 
(2)  Each request must be assigned a unique tracking number, which will be included in 
all correspondence with the requester. 
(3)  (Added) (AF) The Air Force has implemented an electronic FOIA tracking tool, 
called AF eFOIA.  In addition, an AF eFOIA Public Access Link (PAL) has also been 
established for submission of request to FOIA RSC at 
https://www.efoia.af.mil/palMain.aspx.  
(4)  (Added)(AF) Examples of letters to FOIA requesters (e.g., response 
determinations and interim responses) are included in Appendix 1. 
(5)  (Added)(AF) Refer to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at 
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm The general public may also see a 
copy of the AF Records Disposition Schedule at http://www.af.mil/information/index.asp  
under ―Forms and Publications. The functional OPR or FOIA RSC may keep the records 
released or denied. The FOIA RSC keeps the FOIA administrative file for each request in 
eFOIA (starting FY10). The FOIA administrative file consists of: the initial request; 
tasking to OPR that reply (unredacted and redacted responsive records); memoranda for 
record of phone calls or other actions related to the FOIA request; DD Forms 2086, Record 
of Freedom of Information Processing Cost, or 2086-1, Record of Freedom of Information 
Processing Cost for Technical Data; final response; and any of the following, if applicable: 
extension letter; legal opinions; submitter notification letters and replies; the appeal and 
required attachments (except for the released or denied records if maintained by the OPR) 
and all other correspondence to and from the requester and OPR. 
 
b.  Prompt Action on FOIA Requests. 
(1)  When unusual or exceptional circumstances prevent a FOIA RSC from making a 
final response determination within the statutory time period, it will advise the FOIA requester in 
writing and provide the requester an opportunity to narrow the scope of the request.  FOIA RSCs 
will be available, as a matter of good practice, to assist requesters in the formulating of requests. 
(a)  The FOIA describes unusual circumstances as: 
1.  The need to search for and collect the requested records responsive from field 
offices or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the FOIA request. 
2.  The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous 
amount of separate and distinct records. 
3.  The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all practicable speed, 
with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among 
two or more DoD Components having substantial subject-matter interest in the records. 
(b)  The FOIA does not affirmatively explain “exceptional circumstances;” however, 
exceptional circumstances do not include a delay that results from predictable component 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
40 
backlogs, unless the DoD FOIA Program Component demonstrates reasonable progress in 
reducing its backlog. 
(2)  DoD Components receiving a misdirected FOIA request will follow the procedures 
in Subpart 286.7 of Title 32, CFR. 
(3)  DoD FOIA Program Components will provide interim responses when they are 
unable to make a final determination within the statutory 20 working days, and should 
communicate with the FOIA requester before the final response, if appropriate.  These 
communications may include acknowledging receipt of the FOIA request and negotiating with 
the FOIA requester concerning the scope of the FOIA request, the response timeframe, and the 
fee agreement.  However, such communications do not constitute a final response determination.  
The initial interim response will include, at a minimum: 
(a)  The date the 20-working-day statutory time period started for the FOIA request. 
(b)  The tracking number for the FOIA request. 
(c)  Contact information concerning how the FOIA requester can obtain information 
about the processing of the FOIA request. 
(4)  The statutory time period to make a release determination on a FOIA request usually 
begins on the date when the FOIA RSC responsible for the requested records receives the FOIA 
request.  However, if the FOIA request was originally misdirected to another FOIA RSC, the 
timing provisions of Subpart 286.6 of Title 32, CFR, for misdirected requests apply. 
(5)  The 20-working-day statutory period for responding to a FOIA request begins only 
when a perfected FOIA request is received.  After this time, a FOIA RSC may toll the statutory 
time period for only two reasons.  In both situations, the FOIA requester’s response to the DoD 
Component’s request ends the tolling period. 
(a)  The time period may be tolled one time when the FOIA RSC goes back to the 
FOIA requester and reasonably asks for additional information (not connected to the assessment 
of fees). 
(b)  The time period may be tolled if it is necessary for the FOIA RSC to clarify 
issues regarding fee assessment with the FOIA requester.  There is no limit to the number of 
times a DoD Component may go back to a FOIA requester to clarify fee assessment issues, 
which sometimes may be done in stages as the records are located and processed. 
(c)  Estimated Completion Date.  See Subpart 286.9 of Title 32, CFR. 
(d)  Multi-Track Processing.  See Subpart 286.8 of Title 32, CFR. 
(1) (Added)(AF) Simple requests can be processed quickly with 
limited impact on the responding units.  Simple requests clearly identifies the 
records with no (or few) complicating factors involved. There are few or no 
responsive records. Only one installation is involved and there are no outside 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
41 
OPRs.  There are no classified or nongovernment records.  No deliberative 
process/privileged materials are involved. The responsive records contain no (or limited) 
(or limited) personal privacy information and do not come from a Privacy Act system of 
records. No time extensions are anticipated.  
 
 (2) (Added)(AF) Complex requests take substantial time and cause 
significant impact on responding units. With complex requests, complications and delays 
are likely. Records sought are voluminous.  Multiple organizations must review/coordinate 
on requested records. Records may be classified; originated with a nongovernment source; 
or are contractor records, etc.  
 
e.  Expedited Processing.  See Subpart 286.8 of Title 32, CFR. 
f.  Responsive Documents Originated by a Non-government Source.   
(1)  Commercial or Financial Information.  See Subpart 286.10 of Title 32, CFR. 
(2)  Foreign Government or International Organization Information.  The coordination 
provisions of this paragraph apply to the release of responsive information received from foreign 
governments or international organizations. 
(a)  DoD Components should coordinate directly with their foreign government 
counterparts when processing foreign government information responsive to a FOIA request.  
Coordination also may be made through the Department of State or the specific foreign embassy. 
(b)  When the DoD Components locate North American Aerospace Defense 
Command documents in their files responsive to a FOIA request, they will refer the documents 
to the United States Northern Command FOIA RSC, which will consult with the North 
American Aerospace Defense Command. 
(c)  Coordination with most international organizations may be made directly with 
those organizations. 
(d)  When a foreign government or international organization asks the DoD to 
withhold classified information originating with that foreign government or international 
organization, it is withheld pursuant to Exemption 1 of the FOIA. 
(e)  If the DoD Component is asked to withhold sensitive unclassified information 
originated by an international organization or foreign government, then the DoD Component 
withholds it pursuant to Exemption 3 and references the relevant statute as Section 130c of Title 
10, U.S.C.  To qualify for withholding, the information must meet these criteria: 
1.  If the information came into the DoD’s possession or control prior to 
October 30, 2000, and more than 25 years prior to receipt of the FOIA request, the DoD 
Component notifies the foreign government or international organization of the request for 
disclosure.  The information then qualifies for withholding only if the foreign government or 
international organization requests in writing that the information not be disclosed for a specific 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
42 
period of time.  This date can be extended with a later request by the foreign government or 
international organization. 
2.  If the information came into possession or control of the DoD on or after 
October 30, 2000, the information cannot be withheld after the release date specified by the 
foreign government or international organization.  When one or more foreign governments or 
international organizations provided the information, the latest date specified by any of them will 
be used.  If no release date was specified, and the information came into the possession of the 
DoD Component more than 10 years prior to receipt of the FOIA request, the procedures set 
forth in Paragraph 6.2.f.(2)(e)1. apply. 
g.  Processing the Receipt of FOIA Fees.  The Treasurer of the United States has 
established an account for FOIA receipts, Receipt Account 3210.  When depositing the receipts, 
the appropriate disbursing office 2-digit prefix must precede the account number.  This account 
will be used for depositing all FOIA receipts except for those of working capital and non-
appropriated funded activities.  Those activities must establish their own procedures for 
depositing FOIA receipts to the applicable fund.  All checks or money orders remitting FOIA 
fees should be made payable to the U.S. Treasurer. 
h.  Creating a Record.  To be subject to the FOIA, a record must exist and be in DoD 
possession and control when the DoD Component searches for it.  The DoD Components are not 
obligated to create, compile, or answer questions to satisfy a FOIA request. 
(1)  However, in order to provide quality customer service, the DoD Components may 
compile a new record when doing so would result in a more useful response to the FOIA 
requester and would be less burdensome to the DoD Component than providing existing records.  
This could be the case when a FOIA requester wants, for example, a list of all travel locations for 
a single senior official.  Instead of processing the large number of travel documents, the DoD 
Component may wish to compile a list of travel locations extracted from the documents. 
(2)  Prior to the creation of the document, any such compilation should be coordinated 
with and approved by the FOIA requester.  The cost of creating or compiling such a record may 
not be charged to the FOIA requester unless the fee for creating the record is equal to or less than 
the fee that would be charged for providing the existing record.  Fee assessments must be in 
accordance with Subparts 286.12 and 286.13 of Title 32, CFR. 
i.  Electronic Records and Searches.   
(1)  Significant Interference.  Section (a)(3)(C) of the FOIA requires DoD Components to 
make reasonable efforts to conduct electronic searches for responsive documents, except when 
the searches would cause significant interference with the operation of the DoD Components’ 
automated information systems. 
(a)  If extensive monetary or personnel resources are needed to conduct an electronic 
search, DoD Components should take this into account when determining whether they are 
making reasonable efforts to search for electronic records. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
43 
(b)  Creating a computer program that produces specific requested fields or records 
contained within a well-defined database structure usually constitutes a “reasonable effort.”  
However, creating a computer program to merge files with disparate data formats and extract 
specific elements from the resultant file is considered a special service rather than a reasonable 
effort. 
(2)  Data Links.  The DoD Components are not required to expend DoD funds to 
establish data links that provide real-time or near-real-time data to a FOIA requester. 
j.  CISI and MFOQA Data Files.  IDAs may deny CISI and MFOQA system data files 
from release under Exemption 3 of the FOIA after the DA has made a written determination that 
the information is exempt. 
(1)  When DoD Components have reason to believe that information responsive to a 
FOIA request is CISI or MFOQA system data file information, they will submit a package to the 
DA, through the DO&C, recommending exemption of the requested information.  If the 
information believed to be CISI or MFOQA is the subject of a consultation, and the consulted 
DoD Component wishes to assert the exemption, the consulted component will submit the 
package for approval before responding to the consultation.  The package will contain, at a 
minimum: 
(a)  A cover memorandum from a DoD Component official. 
(b)  A copy of the initial FOIA request. 
(c)  A copy of the documents in electronic format, with only the CISI or MFOQA 
system data file information marked.  Do not indicate information that will be denied under any 
other exemption. 
(d)  Details on how the information recommended for exemption meets the threshold 
of qualifying as CISI or MFOQA system data file. 
(e)  A thorough explanation of the harm that could reasonably be expected to result if 
the information is released.  This explanation must be as specific as possible to allow the DA to 
make a fully informed determination; however, it should contain only publicly releasable 
information since the DA’s determination, accompanied by a statement of the basis for 
determination, will be made available on the FOIA section of the DoD Open Government 
Website.   
(f)  Any documentation of the public interest in the release of the information.  This 
could be provided to the DoD Component by the FOIA requester or other interested parties 
supporting the FOIA request. 
(g)  A draft of the DA determination and statement of the basis for determination. 
(2)  The DO&C will provide the DA determination and the statement of the basis for the 
determination and post it in the FOIA section of the DoD Open Government Website. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
44 
(3)  The DoD Component IDA will deny the exempt information and provide a copy of 
the determination to the FOIA requester.  If the DoD Component denying the information is a 
consulted component, the DoD Component that received and is processing the request will make 
all necessary notifications to the requester.  The FOIA requester will be advised of the right to 
appeal to the DoD Component’s appellate authority. 
6.3.  INITIAL DETERMINATIONS. 
a.  Denials of Information.   
(1)  An IDA must make a determination of whether to withhold information responsive to 
a FOIA request.  The IDA will review the withheld information to determine whether it meets 
the criteria for withholding pursuant to one or more of the FOIA exemptions.  This determination 
may be made upon the recommendation of a review official. 
(2)  IDA and review officials will not use the existence of classification markings or 
distribution limiting statements, such as “For Official Use Only” markings, as justification to 
withhold information.  Information so marked must be reviewed after the receipt of a FOIA 
request to determine if a FOIA exemption allows the withholding of the information. 
(3)  To deny information in a requested record that is in the possession and control of the 
DoD Component, the IDA must determine that one or more of the FOIA exemptions justify 
withholding all or part of the record. 
(4)  A Glomar response constitutes a total denial. 
b.  Reasons for Denying a FOIA Request Other than Exemptions.  The following are 
reasons, other than using one or more exemptions, for denying a FOIA request.  The DoD FOIA 
Program Components will track each reason in its control system database for ease of retrieval 
and for its input to the annual report. 
(1)  No Records.  A reasonable search of files failed to identify responsive records, or no 
search was undertaken because the DoD Component determined that it would not locate records 
responsive to the request. 
(2)  Referral.  The DoD Component has transferred all responsive records to another DoD 
Component or federal agency. 
(3)  Request Withdrawn.  The FOIA requester withdraws the FOIA request.  
Additionally, when a FOIA RSC sends a communication to ask if a requester still has interest in 
the request and the requester does not respond, the FOIA RSC will consider the request as 
withdrawn. 
(4)  Fee-related Reason.  The FOIA requester is unwilling to pay fees associated with a 
FOIA request; the FOIA requester is past due in the payment of fees from a previous FOIA 
request; or the FOIA requester disagrees with the fee estimate. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
45 
(5)  Records not Reasonably Described.  A record has not been described with sufficient 
particularity to enable the DoD Component to locate it by conducting a reasonable search. 
(6)  Not a Proper FOIA Request for Some Other Reason.  The FOIA requester has failed 
unreasonably to comply with procedural requirements, other than fee-related requirements, 
imposed by this issuance. 
(7)  Not an Agency Record.  The information requested is not a record within the 
meaning of the FOIA. 
(8)  Duplicate Request.  A duplicate request occurs when the FOIA requester asks for the 
same information requested in a prior request.  If a search for documents responsive to the new 
request finds documents created since the search was accomplished for the previous request, then 
it is not considered duplicative.  This includes identical requests received from the same 
requester for the same information through different means (e.g., e-mail, facsimile, mail, courier) 
at the same or different times. 
(9)  Other.  The DoD Components may use the following additional reasons for denying 
FOIA requests: 
(a)  Directed Requester to Another Agency.  The FOIA request is for another federal 
agency’s records (e.g., the Department of State), and the FOIA RSC directs the requester to send 
a FOIA request to the appropriate agency.  This would include a request for another agency’s 
records that are already publicly available. 
(b)  Litigation.  The FOIA request is administratively closed because the FOIA 
requester has filed a complaint in federal court.  In this case, the FOIA RSC should consult legal 
counsel to determine whether to continue processing the FOIA request. 
(c)  Misdirected Request.  A misdirected request will not be counted as a request 
received or processed for annual report purposes. 
(d)  Unable to Contact Requester.  The FOIA RSC is unable to contact the FOIA 
requester after several attempts. 
c.  Responding to FOIA Requesters.  All correspondence with FOIA requesters must 
include the FOIA request tracking number and the date of the FOIA request. 
(1)  Grant.  When a DoD Component decides to release a record, the FOIA RSC should 
make a copy available promptly to the FOIA requester.  Directing a FOIA requester on how to 
electronically obtain a publicly available DoD record (e.g., a record released under the FOIA and 
available in a DoD FOIA Program Component’s FOIA Library) is considered a grant. 
(2)  Adverse Determination.  When a DoD Component provides an adverse determination 
in response to a FOIA request, the official designated to respond will comply with the procedures 
in Subpart 286.9 of Title 32, CFR. 
d.  Providing Documents to FOIA Requesters.  See Subpart 286.9 of Title 32, CFR. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
46 
e.  Commercial Delivery Services.  A FOIA RSC may use a commercial delivery service to 
deliver the requested information in a timelier manner if the FOIA requester asks for the service 
and pays directly for the service. 
6.4.  CONSULTATIONS, REFERRALS, AND COORDINATIONS.   
a.  General Provisions.  See Subpart 286.7 of Title 32, CFR.  
b.  White House Information.  DoD FOIA Program Components locating records 
originating with or containing White House equities, to include the National Security Council 
Staff, will forward the records as a consultation to the Office of Freedom of Information, which 
is the FOIA RSC for the OSD/JS.  The Office of Freedom of Information will coordinate with 
the National Security Council Staff and then return the records to the DoD Component for 
response to the FOIA requester.   
c.  Government Accountability Office (GAO) Information.  The GAO is outside the 
Executive Branch and not subject to the FOIA.  FOIA requests for GAO documents within DoD 
files will be processed pursuant to the FOIA.  If necessary, the DoD Components will consult 
with the GAO on the releasability of the requested information.  The DoD Component will make 
the final response. 
d.  (Added)(AF) Consultation. When an Air Force FOIA RSC receives a FOIA request for 
an Air Force record that contains classified information in which another federal agency 
(including a Combatant Command) has a clear and substantial interest in the subject matter, 
consultation with that other organization is required. This can be done verbally or in writing. 
In order to comply with the Backlog Reduction Initiative, the Air Force has implemented a 
processing procedure to expedite the processing of FOIA requests for Air Force records 
containing classified information in which another federal agency must be consulted. This new 
process includes expeditiously closing FOIA cases for which consultation has been sought. 
Process a FOIA request for a classified Air Force record that contains another federal agency’s 
or DoD Component’s equities as follows: 
(1) (Added)(AF) Request that the other federal agency or DoD Component respond 
within a specified period of time. (T-1). 
 
 
 
a.  (Added)(AF) If the responsive records consist of 100 or fewer pages, request 
the other federal agency or DoD Component to provide its review and proposed release 
determination concerning its equities within 30 days of its receipt of the request for 
consultation. (T-1).   
 
 
 
b.  (Added)(AF) If the responsive records consist of more than 100 pages, request 
the other federal agency or DoD Component to provide its review and proposed release 
determination concerning its equities within 90 days of its receipt of the request for 
consultation. (T-1). 
 
 
 
c.  (Added)(AF) For requests for consultation that are pending upon publication 
of this change, contact the other federal agency or DoD Component and request it provide its 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
47 
review and proposed release determination concerning its equities within the periods 
specified in paragraph d.(1).a. or d.(1).b., as appropriate, following its receipt of the request 
for a response. (T-1). 
 
(2) (Added)(AF) In seeking consultation, the RSC will notify the other federal agency 
that the Air Force will release all Air Force releasable information from the record and 
withhold all classified information containing the other federal agency’s equities if the other 
agency does not reply within the requested timeframe. If the other federal agency has not 
replied by the requested date, no other FOIA exemptions will be claimed to withhold the 
other agency‘s classified equities.  Only exemption (b)(1) will be used to withhold other 
federal agency classified equity information that is marked as classified in the Air Force 
document(s). (T-1). 
 
(3) (Added)(AF) Air Force information from the classified record that may be 
releasable will be released only after concurrence by the appropriate Air Force classifier and 
IDA. If the appropriate classifier and IDA determine it is not in the Air Force’s interest to 
release the Air Force unclassified or declassified information from a classified record 
containing another agency’s classified or unclassified equities, the case will remain open and 
no information will be released from the Air Force record until the other agency(s) has 
responded to the Air Force’s consultation request. (T-1). 
 
 
(4)  (Added)(AF) The response letter to the requester will advise the requester of the 
Air Force’s release decision with respect to all information withheld by the Air Force, 
including information withheld under exemption (b)(1) concerning another federal agency’s 
or DoD Component’s classified or unclassified equities contained in the classified record. The 
requester will be provided normal appeal rights to the Air Force, and the FOIA case will be 
closed in eFOIA. The requester will not be referred to the other federal agency or DoD 
Component (or informed what other federal agencies or DoD Components have equities in 
the Air Force record). (T-1). 
 
 
 
a.  (Added)(AF) If, after the Air Force responded to the requester and closed the 
FOIA case, the other federal agency or DoD Component responds to the Air Force 
consultation request with a determination that some of the information in which it has an 
equity may be released.  The RSC will re-open the case, obtain a review of the information 
the other federal agency or DoD Component has determined to be releasable by the 
appropriate Air Force OPR and classifier.  If the Air Force OPR and classifier determines 
that no Air Force interest would be harmed by the disclosure of the information, the RSC 
will provide the information to the requester with additional appeal rights. The additional 
appeal rights should make clear that an appeal under these circumstances is submitted to the 
Air Force. (T-1). 
 
 
 
b.  (Added)(AF) If, after the Air Force responded to the requester and closed the 
FOIA case, the other federal agency or DoD Component responds to the Air Force’s 
consultation request with a determination that none of the information in which it has an 
equity may be released, the RSC will not further engage the requester or re-open the case. 
Document the other federal agencies or DoD Component’s decision in the case file. (T-1).   
 
 
 
c.  (Added)(AF) If the requester appeals any withholding by the other agency or 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
48 
DoD Component of the other federal agency’s or DoD Component’s equities, notify the 
federal agency or DoD Component and forward a copy of the appeal. Do not close the appeal 
until the federal agency or DoD Component has responded with their appeal review 
determination. (T-1). 
 
 
(5)  (Added)(AF) In seeking consultation, the RSC will notify the other federal 
agency that the Air Force will release all Air Force releasable information from the record 
and withhold all information containing the other federal agency’s equities if the other 
federal agency does not reply within the required timeframe. If the other federal agency has 
not replied in the required timeframe, no other FOIA exemptions will be claimed to 
withhold other agency equity information. Exemption (b)(1) will only be used to withhold 
other federal agency equity information that is marked as classified in the Air Force 
document(s). (T-1).   
 
 
(6)  (Added)(AF) Air Force information from the classified record that may be 
releasable will be released only after concurrence by the appropriate Air Force classifier and 
IDA. If the appropriate classifier and IDA determine it is not in the Air Force’s interest to 
release Air Force unclassified or declassified information from a record containing another 
federal agency’s classified equities, the case will remain open and no information will be 
released from the Air Force record until the other agency(s) has responded to the Air Force’s 
consultation request. (T-1). 
 
 
(7)  (Added)(AF) The response letter to the requester will advise the requester of the 
Air Force’s release decision with respect to all information withheld by the Air Force, to 
include information withheld under exemption (b)(1) concerning another agency’s equities. 
The requester will be provided normal appeal rights to the Air Force, and the FOIA case 
will be closed in eFOIA. The requester will not be referred to the other agency (or informed 
what other agencies have equities in the Air Force record) for a determination of the release 
of other agency equity information contained in an Air Force record that was redacted and 
withheld by the Air Force under this procedure. (T-1). 
 
 
 
a.  (Added)(AF) If the other federal agency(s) responds to the Air Force’s 
consultation request after the Air Force redacted their equity information from the Air 
Force record and had closed the FOIA case, and determined any of their equity information 
is releasable, re-open the case and respond to the requester with the other agency’s release 
determination and provide additional appeal rights. (T-1).   
 
 
 
b.  (Added)(AF) If the other federal agency responded with a denial 
determination, do not further engage the requester or re-open the FOIA case, but document 
the other agency’s decision in the case file. (T-1).  
  
 
 
c.  (Added)(AF) In the event the requester appeals, the RSC will re-engage with 
the other federal agencies who have equities in the Air Force record to obtain their release 
determination as to their equity information. The appeal will not be closed until the other 
agency(s) have responded with their release recommendations as to their information 
previously withheld by the Air Force. (T-1).

SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
49 
6.5.  APPEALS.  See Subpart 286.11 of Title 32, CFR. 
6.5.1.  (Added)(AF) FOIA requesters seeking Air Force records must address 
appeals to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, through the FOIA RSC of the IDA 
that denied the request. Requestors may submit appeals by mail, email, fax, or online at the 
Air Force Public Access Link: https://www.efoia.af.mil/palMain.aspx.  Requesters should 
attach a copy of the denial letter to their appeal and give reasons for appealing. Air Force 
IDA may reconsider any prior denials and may grant all or part of a requester’s appeal. 
When any appellate action sought by a FOIA requester is denied by an IDA, the IDA will 
include a statement that the issues raised in the appeal were considered and rejected (in full 
or in part) in any file sent to the Secretary of the Air Force in the course of a FOIA appeal 
action. Send all appeals of IDA decisions at the wing level through the MAJCOM FOIA 
RSC for sending to the Secretary of the Air Force’s designated appellate authority, 
SAF/GCA (through Air Force Legal Operations Agency [AFLOA/JACL]), for a final 
administrative determination. 
 
 6.5.2. (Added)(AF) Coordinate appeals with an Air Force attorney (and the OPR, if 
appropriate) so they can consider factual and legal arguments raised in the appeal, and can 
prepare written assessments of issues raised in the appeal to assist the IDA in considering 
the appeal.  FOIA RSC (through MAJCOM FOIA RSC) send all appeals to the Secretary 
of the Air Force through AFLOA/JACL for consideration, unless the IDA has reconsidered 
the initial denial action, and granted the appeal in full as requested by the requester. (T-1). 
 
6.5.3. (Added)(AF) If a requester appeals a "no records" determination, 
organizations must search again or verify the adequacy of their first search (for example, if 
a second search would be fruitless, the organization may include a signed statement from 
either the records OPR or FOIA Manager detailing why another search was not practical). 
The appeal package must include documents (to include a certification from the records 
OPR) that show how the organization tried to find responsive records. (T-1).  In the event a 
requester sues the Air Force to contest a determination that no responsive records exist, 
formal affidavits may be required to support the adequacy of any searches conducted. 
 
6.5.4. (Added)(AF) If a requester appeals a denial of a fee waiver, fee estimate, or fee 
reduction request, FOIA offices and record OPR must account for actual and estimated costs 
of processing a request, and will include copies of the DD Forms 2086 or 2086-1 in the appeal 
package. 
6.6.  FEE SCHEDULE.  See Subparts 286.12 and 286.13 of Title 32, CFR. 
6.7.  FOIA LITIGATION. 
a.  FOIA requesters may seek an order from a U.S. District Court to compel release of 
information after administrative remedies have been exhausted (e.g., when the FOIA requester 
has filed an administrative appeal of an adverse action or when the DoD FOIA Program 
Component has failed to respond within the time limits prescribed by the FOIA).  The 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 6:  FOIA REQUEST PROCESSING 
50 
Department of Justice “Freedom of Information Act Guide” provides more detailed guidance on 
FOIA litigation. 
b.  If a DoD Component is served with a complaint concerning a FOIA request that is still 
open, it will administratively close the FOIA request after consultation with legal counsel. 
c.  FOIA officers should confer with legal counsel or Department of Justice attorneys on 
whether administrative processing should continue and whether it is appropriate to communicate 
directly with the FOIA requester or requester’s counsel. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 7:  EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
51 
SECTION 7:  EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
7.1.  GENERAL.  In accordance with Section (j)(2)(F) of the FOIA, the purpose of the DoD 
FOIA educational and training programs is to provide DoD personnel who have FOIA 
responsibilities as one of their primary duties, and DoD attorneys, with the knowledge and skills 
necessary to ensure compliance with the FOIA.  Fulfilling this purpose will improve customer 
service to members of the public and improve the public trust in the DoD. 
7.2.  PROCEDURES.   
a.  The DO&C establishes a DoD FOIA educational and training program to provide 
personnel involved in the day-to-day processing of FOIA requests with a thorough understanding 
of the provisions and requirements of Part 286 of Title 32, CFR, the FOIA, and this issuance. 
b.  Each DoD FOIA Program Component designs its FOIA educational and training 
programs to fit the particular requirements of its personnel, dependent upon their degrees of 
involvement in implementing  the FOIA.  These programs will service two target audiences.  
(1)  Personnel whoare involved in the day-to-day processing of FOIA requests. 
(2)  Staff personnel who provide search or review staff-support to the DoD FOIA 
Program Component FOIA process. 
c.  (Added)(AF) FOIA Managers and anyone who processes FOIA request are required 
to complete annual FOIA Computer Based Training (CBT).  It is also highly encouraged 
that FOIA monitors, OPR and IDA complete the annual training.  Initial training should 
be completed within 5 days of appointment for all FOIA personnel. (T-1).   
d.  (Added)(AF) When the SAF/CIO A6XA Annual FOIA Conference/Information 
Access Professional Workshop is funded/approved, all FOIA Managers are highly 
encouraged to attend.  The Information Access Professional Workshop provides education 
and training on current statutory, regulatory, and directive-based FOIA, Privacy, Records 
Management, Information Collections, Section 508, and various other programs.  The 
overall goal of the conference/workshop is to enhance the ability of the AF FOIA Managers 
to comply with CIO governance requirements.  Individuals who perform duties at any 
levels in the Air Force Information Access Programs are encouraged to participate. 
7.3.  SCOPE AND PRINCIPLES.  The programs will: 
a.  Familiarize personnel with the requirements of the FOIA and its implementation by Part 
286 of Title 32, this issuance, and respective DoD FOIA Program Component issuances. 
b.  Instruct personnel who act in FOIA matters on the provisions of Part 286 of Title 32 and 
this issuance, and advise them of the legal hazards involved in and the strict prohibition against 
arbitrary and capricious withholding of information. 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
SECTION 7:  EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
52 
c.  Provide procedural and legal guidance and instruction to initial denial and appellate 
authorities concerning the discharge of their responsibilities. 
7.4.  IMPLEMENTATION.  To ensure uniformity of interpretation, the DoD FOIA Program 
Components will coordinate their educational and training programs with the DO&C.

asking the appellate authority of a DoD Component to reverse, modify, or reconsider any adverse 
determination. 
adverse determination.  Defined in Subpart 286.9 of Title 32, CFR.   
agency record.  Includes all documents or records created or obtained by a U.S. Government 
agency that are in the agency’s possession and control at the time a FOIA request is received.  
Four factors determine an agency’s control:  
The intent of the creator of the document to retain control over the record.  
The ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit.  
The extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the document.   
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
GLOSSARY 
54 
The degree to which the document was integrated into the agency’s record systems or files.  
Records maintained by a government contractor for records management purposes are 
considered in the DoD Component’s possession.  Records created by an agency employee during 
employment, including e-mails, may be either agency records or personal files.   
Examples of agency records include: 
Research data produced during the performance of a federal grant used by the U.S. 
Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, in accordance 
with Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-110.   
All recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics.  “Form or characteristics” 
refers to physical media type or transmission mode desired by the FOIA requester (e.g., 
computer disk, computer tape, file transfer protocol, photographs, videotape, and microfiche). 
Examples of agency records do not include:   
Objects or articles such as structures, furniture, vehicles, and equipment, whatever their 
historical value or value as evidence. 
Anything that is not a tangible or documentary record, such as an individual’s memory or 
oral communication. 
Personal files. 
The definition of an agency record under the FOIA is more expansive than the definition of a 
federal record.  For example, documents such as drafts and working files are not considered 
official records, but are still agency records responsive to FOIA requests. 
appellate authority.  The DoD FOIA Program Component head, or designee, having 
jurisdiction to review and possibly reverse, remand, or amend any adverse determination.   
CISI.  Defined in Section 130e(c) of Title 10, U.S.C. 
consultation.  The process whereby, in certain situations, a federal agency transfers a FOIA

assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, 
and assisting in the resolution of disputes. 
FOIA request.  A written request for agency records that reasonably describes the records 
sought, enabling a DoD Component employee familiar with the files to locate the records with a 
reasonable amount of effort.   
FOIA requester.  Any person, including a partnership, corporation, association, State or State 
agency, foreign government, foreign national, or a lawyer or other representative acting on

Business or professional files created before entering U.S. Government service; files created 
during or relating to previously held positions, political materials, and reference files. 
Private files brought into, created, or received in the office; family and personal 
correspondence; and materials documenting professional activities and outside business or 
political pursuits, including manuscripts and drafts for articles and books and volunteer and 
community service records that are considered personal, even if created or received while in 
office, because they do not relate to agency business. 
Work-related personal files, including e-mails, diaries, journals, notes, and personal 
calendars and appointment schedules.  Though work-related, these files may be personal if they 
are used only as reminders and personal observations on work-related topics and not for the

(ADDED) (AF) APPENDICES 
 
(Added)(AF) APPENDIX 1 
 
SAMPLES, AIR FORCE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROCESSING 
DOCUMENTS 
 
AP1.1. GENERAL. This appendix includes suggested language in paragraph format that 
tracks Air Force and DoD Freedom of Information Act guidance. The rest of the body of 
letters and memorandums should comply with Air Force administrative guidance. Each 
MAJCOM may elect to prepare their own verbiage to meet their specific needs, so long as 
FOIA processing actions are consistent with guidance in DoDM 5400.07 and this AFMAN.  
In this appendix, language in italics is for explanatory purposes only. DO NOT include any 
of the italicized language of this appendix in your FOIA correspondence. When optional 
language must be selected, the optional language will be presented within brackets. Use 
only the portions that apply to the specific request or response. 
 
AP1.2. INITIAL RECEIPT OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST.  
 
“We received your FOIA request dated ## Month year, for (summarize the request) on ## 
Month year (date received). We will provide you our release determination by (enter date 
that is 20 workdays from date you received the request). [Based on our initial review, we 
believe we cannot process your request within 20 workdays.] (If “cannot” is used, add 
appropriate explanation; examples follow.) Please contact (name and commercial 
telephone number) if you have any questions and refer to case number#######.” 
 
AP1.3 INTERIM RESPONSE.  
 
“Your request will be delayed because: all or part of the responsive records are not located 
at this installation; (and/or) Processing this FOIA request will require us to collect and 
review a substantial number of records (and/or) Other Air Force activities or other 
agencies (if applicable) to include the submitter of the information, need to be involved in 
deciding whether or not to release the responsive records. We expect to reply to your 
request not later than (give a date that is not more than 30 workdays from the initial receipt 
of the request); (or) (If processing the FOIA request will take more than the allowed time 
limits to respond). We find we are unable to meet the time limits imposed by the FOIA in 
this instance because (tell the requester the reason for the delay) (example: the records are 
classified and must be reviewed for possible declassification by other activities or agencies). 
We anticipate completing your request by (date).  
 
(When charging fees is appropriate), “The FOIA provides for the collection of fees based 
on the costs of processing a FOIA request and your fee category. Based on the 
information in your request, we have determined your fee category is 
[commercial/educational or noncommercial scientific institution or news media/all 
others]. As a result, you (if commercial category) are required to pay all document search, 
review and duplication costs over $25.00. (or) As a result, you (if educational or

noncommercial scientific institution or news media ) will be provided the first one 
hundred (100) pages free of charge; you are required to pay any duplication costs over 
and above those amounts. (or) As a result, you (if all others) will be provided the first two 
(2) hours of search time and the first one hundred (100) pages free of charge; you are 
required to pay any search and duplication costs over and above those amounts.” 
 
AP1.4. REQUEST FOR A MORE SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION.  
 
“Your request does not sufficiently describe the desired records. The FOIA applies to 
existing Air Force records; without more specific information from you, we cannot 
identify what documents might be responsive to your request. Please give us whatever 
additional details you may have on the Air Force records you want. Can you tell us when 
the records were created, and what Air Force element may have created the records? If 
this request involves an Air Force contract, do you know the contract number and dates 
it covered? Our address is (include name and complete mailing address), our fax number 
is (give fax number) our e-mail address is (optional - give complete e-mail address). Based 
on the original request you sent us, we are unable to respond.” 
 
AP1.5. SINGLE LETTER ACKNOWLEDGING RECEIPT OF REQUEST AND GIVING 
FINAL RESPONSE (If you can complete a FOIA request within the statutory 20-workday 
processing period, Air Force elements may elect to send a single letter to the requester, along 
with responsive records which are released to the requester in full).  
 
“We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated ## Month year, 
for (summarize the request) on ## Month year (date received). A copy (or) Copies of 
(describe the record(s) being released) [is/are] releasable and [is/are] attached.” 
 
AP1.6. COLLECTION OF FEES. 
 
“The FOIA provides for the collection of fees based on the costs of processing a FOIA 
request and your fee category. We have placed you in the (enter the fee category) fee 
category.  In your case, we have assessed a charge of $          for processing your request.  
The fee was calculated in the following manner: (Give a detailed cost breakdown: for 
example, 15 pages of reproduction at $0.15 per page; 5 minutes of computer search time at 
$43.50 per minute, 2 hours of professional level search at $48 per hour.) Please make your 
check payable to “U.S. Treasurer” and send it to (give your complete mailing address) by 
(date 30 days after the letter is signed).  (or) The FOIA provides for the collection of fees 
based on the costs of processing a FOIA request and your fee category.  We have placed you 
in the (enter the fee category); however, in this case, we have waived collecting fees.” 
 
AP1.7. MULTITRACK PROCESSING LETTERS TO FOIA REQUESTERS (When using 
the multitrack FOIA processing system, determine which of the following paragraphs to 
include in your letters to the requester. To the extent it may apply, include language from 
paragraph 2 of the sample. If a requester asks for expedited processing, answer carefully if 
you decide not to provide expedited processing, because requesters may appeal denial of their 
request for expedited processing. Advise requestors placed into the complex track in writing 
how they can simplify their request to qualify for the simple track.)

“We received your FOIA request dated ## Month year, for (summarize the request) on ## 
Month year (date received).  Because our organization has a significant number of pending 
FOIA requests, which prevents us from making a response determination within 20 
workdays, we have instituted multitrack processing of requests. Based on the information 
you provided, we have placed your request in the [simple or complex] track. We have 
assigned number ##### to identify your request; should you need to contact us about your 
request, please write or call (name and telephone) and use this number to assist us in 
responding more promptly. 
 
AP1.8. IF THE REQUEST IS PLACED IN THE COMPLEX TRACK.  
 
“In your case, processing your request is complex because (give basic reasons this is a 
complex case: request was vague or complicated; the records sought are voluminous; 
multiple organizations will have to work on this request; records are classified; responsive 
records came from another command/another service/a nongovernment source; responsive 
records were part of the Air Force's decision-making process, and the prerelease review will 
require policy determinations from different Air Force elements; records describe law 
enforcement activities; records involve foreign policy issues; due to the nature of your 
request and/or the nature of our computer system, responding to your request or providing a 
response in the electronic format you requested will be technically complex, etc.). 
Simplifying your request might permit quicker processing in the following ways: (describe 
ways the search could be narrowed to fewer records, or ways policy issues could be avoided, 
etc.) Can you tell us when the records were created, and what Air Force element may have 
created the records? If this request involves an Air Force contract, do you know the 
contract number? Please give us whatever additional details you may have on the Air 
Force records you are seeking, so we can attempt to streamline the processing of your 
request. Our address is (give complete mailing address), our fax number is (give fax 
number) our e-mail address is (optional - give complete e-mail address).” 
 
AP1.9. IF THE REQUESTER ASKS THAT YOU EXPEDITE THEIR REQUEST:  
 
“Because individuals receiving expedited processing may receive a response before other 
earlier requesters, there are administrative requirements you must meet before we can 
expedite a request. In your request, you asked that we expedite processing. In order for us 
to expedite a request, the requester must provide a statement certifying the reasons 
supporting their request are true and correct to the best of their knowledge.  
 
“There are four categories of requests eligible for expedited processing. We can expedite 
your request if you demonstrate you need the information because (1) failure to obtain the 
records on an expedited basis could pose an imminent threat to life or physical safety of an 
individual; or (2) the information is urgently needed by an individual primarily engaged in 
disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal 
Government activity; or (3) failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could lead to 
an imminent loss of substantial due process rights, or (4) release would serve a 
humanitarian need by promoting the welfare and interests of mankind.

“In the second category, "urgently needed" means the information itself has a particular 
value that it will lose if it is not disseminated quickly. Ordinarily this means the 
information concerns a breaking news story of general public interest. Historic 
information, or information sought for litigation or commercial activities usually would not 
qualify for expedited processing in the second category. Also, the fact that a news 
organization has an internal broadcast or publication deadline, so long as the deadline was 
unrelated to the nature of the information itself (for example, the information was not a 
breaking news story of general public interest), this would not make the information 
"urgently needed." 
“In this case, we have determined your FOIA request [will /will not] receive expedited 
processing. We came to this conclusion because you [did /did not] demonstrate you needed 
the information because failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis [could or could 
not] reasonably expect to pose an imminent threat to life or physical safety of an 
individual (or) the information [is or is not] urgently needed in order to inform the public 
about actual or alleged Federal Government activity (or) failure to obtain the records on 
an expedited basis [could or could not] reasonably expect to lead to an imminent loss of 
substantial due process rights, (or) release [would or would not] serve a humanitarian 
need by promoting the welfare and interests of mankind (and/or) your request for 
expedited processing did not meet the statutory requirements of the FOIA; you did not 
provide enough information to make a determination of compelling need for the 
information you requested (and/or) you did not properly certify your request.” 
 
AP1.10. IF YOU DENY A REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:  
 
“If you consider our decision not to expedite your request incorrect, you may appeal our 
decision.  Include in your appeal letter the reasons for reconsidering your request for 
expedited processing, and attach a copy of this letter.  Address your appeal to: Secretary of 
the Air Force through (address of FOIA RSC) or submit online at the Air Force Public

RECORDS OR FORMAT REQUESTED) (When answering a request for electronic records, 
based on the configuration of your hardware and/or software, certain factors may make a 
particular request complex.  Have your computer system manager advise you whether or not 
they can create the new record/format on a "business as usual" basis.  If producing the 
record/format would entail a significant expenditure of resources in time and manpower that 
would cause significant interference with the operation of the information system and adversely 
affect mission accomplishment, you do not need to process the request. The FOIA RSC needs 
to get a certification from the computer systems manager to document this determination to 
support their response.  Possible language for this certification is provided below.) 
 
“I, (rank/grade and name) am the computer systems manager for (organization with

 (If there are electronic records) The existing electronic records [do/do not] contain non-
releasable data that we [can/cannot] remove from the electronic record. Because of the way 
our [computer system/database/software] (use all that apply, specify hardware and/or software 
nomenclature if possible; for example, IBM ###, Microsoft Excel) is configured, creating the 
electronic record (or) modifying the existing record/format would entail a significant 
expenditure of resources in time and manpower that would cause significant interference with 
the operation of the information system and adversely affect mission accomplishment (describe 
how responding would interfere and time/manpower resources required, give estimated 
reprogramming time, if possible).  I understand that when the capability exists to respond to a 
FOIA request that would require only a business as usual approach to electronically extract the 
data and compile an electronic record or reformat data to satisfy a FOIA request, then 
creation of the electronic record or reformatting the data would be appropriate. In this case, a 
significant expenditure of resources and manpower would be required to compile the electronic 
record (or) reformat existing data.  This activity would cause significant interference with the 
operation of our automated information system.  I certify creation of the electronic record (or) 
reformatting existing data in order to respond to this request would not be reasonable, under

AP1.14. CERTIFICATION OF INITIAL CLASSIFICATION OR DECLASSIFICATION 
AUTHORITY (When denying a FOIA request, in whole or in part, because the 
information requested is classified, the initial classification authority, his or her successor, 
or a declassification authority, needs to determine if the records are "properly and 
currently classified," and therefore must be withheld from release under FOIA exemption 
(b)(1); also, you need to determine that you cannot release any reasonably segregable 
additional portions. Language that certifies such a determination was made on a FOIA 
request involving classified records follows).

Unauthorized release could cause (for TOP SECRET, use exceptionally grave; for SECRET 
use serious; for CONFIDENTIAL do not add language; should read cause damage) damage

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING OF AIR FORCE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 
ACT REQUESTS 
 
 
AP2.1. General. This appendix is a checklist format of processing steps and explanations of 
Air Force and DoD guidance.  Each MAJCOM may elect to prepare its own checklists to 
tailor FOIA processing actions within its own organizations to meet their specific needs, so 
long as it remains consistent with guidance contained in DoDM 5400.07 and this AFMAN. 
 
AP2.2. Procedures: FOIA Requests 
 
AP2.2.1. Note the date the request was received, give the request a unique 
identifier/number, and log the request. 
 
AP2.2.2. Assess the request to determine initial processing requirements: 
 
AP2.2.2.1. Determine what Air Force elements may hold responsive records.  
 
AP2.2.2.1.1. Are responsive records kept at the same or different 
installations? 
 
AP2.2.2.1.2. Is referral of (all/part) of the request required? 
 
AP2.2.3. Determine appropriate processing track (simple/complex/expedited). (Air Force 
FOIA RSC without backlogs do not multitrack FOIA request.) NOTE: Requesters have a 
right to appeal an adverse tracking decision (for example, when it is determined their 
request will not be expedited.) Also, if their request qualifies for the complex track, tell 
requesters so they may limit the scope of their request in order to qualify for the simple 
track if applicable.  FOIA Managers must assess a request before placing it into a specific 
processing track, and must support their actions should the requester appeal.  If a request 
is not expedited when the requester sought expedited processing, you must advise the 
requester of the adverse tracking decision in writing. See Appendix 1 for sample language 
for this kind of letter to a requester. 
 
AP2.2.3.1. Simple - defines a request that can be processed quickly, with limited impact on 
the responding units. The request clearly identifies the records, involves no (or few) 
complicating factors (e.g., there are few or no responsive records, involves only one 
installation and there are no outside OPR, involves no classified records [Exemption 1], a 
law that exempts the responsive records from disclosure [Exemption 3], no contractor-
submitted records [Exemption 4], no deliberative process/privileged materials [Exemption 
5], records that contain no [or limited] personal privacy information/did not come from 
Privacy Act systems of records (per AFI 33-332, Privacy and Civil Liberties Program) 
concerning other individuals [Exemption 6], release of records would have minimal 
impact on law enforcement [Exemption 7]; no time extensions expected, other than the 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018

72 
additional 10-workdays allowed in situations outlined in the FOIA). If the requested data 
must come from electronic records, the response can be completed on a "business-as-
usual" basis; requires no (or limited) reprogramming of automated information systems 
and would cause no significant interference with operation of information systems by 
processing a simple request/providing a response in the electronic format requested. 
 
AP2.2.3.2. Complex - defines a request whose processing will take substantial time, will 
cause significant impact on responding units. Complications and delays are likely (e.g., the 
request is vague (poor description of records, unclear who or when records were created), 
records are massive in volume, multiple organizations will receive tasking, records are 
classified [Exemption 1], records came from another command/service/a nongovernment 
source [Exemption 4], records are part of the Air Force's decision-making process, and 
not incorporated into a final decision [IG/audit reports, legal opinions, misconduct or 
mishap investigations etc.] or are attorney-client records [Exemption 5], records are 
largely personal information on another individual or came from Privacy Act systems of 
records [Exemption 6], records describe law enforcement activities or information from 
[and/or identities of] confidential sources [Exemption 7]; response cannot be completed on 
a "business as usual" basis and would require extensive reprogramming or cause 
significant interference with operation of the automated information systems). Advise 
requester, in writing, of right to limit the scope of their request in order to qualify for 
simple track if applicable. 
 
AP2.2.3.3. An expedited request is when a requester asks for expedited processing and 
explains the compelling need (imminent threat to life or physical safety; urgently needed by 
a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; due process; or humanitarian 
need) for the requested information. In order to receive expedited processing, requesters 
must provide a statement certifying their "demonstration" (description) of their specific 
"compelling need" or due process/humanitarian need is true and correct to the best of their 
knowledge. When a requester seeks expedited processing, FOIA RSC must respond in 
writing to the requester within 10 calendar days after receipt of the request approving or 
denying their request for expedited processing. Requesters have a right to appeal an 
adverse decision (e.g., when it is determined their requests will not be expedited). There are 
four categories of FOIA requests that qualify for expedited processing:  
 
AP2.2.3.3.1. The requester asserts a "compelling need" for the records, because a failure 
to obtain records quickly could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the 
life or physical safety of an individual. 
 
AP2.2.3.3.2. The requester asserts a "compelling need" for the records, because the 
information is “urgently needed” by an individual engaged in disseminating information 
to inform the public (primarily news media requesters). Other persons must demonstrate 
that their primary activity involves publishing or otherwise disseminating information to 
the public. NOTE: “Urgently needed,” in this case, means the information has a particular 
value that will be lost if it is not disseminated quickly. This normally would apply to a 
breaking news story of general public interest. Information of historical interest only, or 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018

73 
sought for litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would the fact a news 
media entity had an internal broadcast deadline of its own, which was unrelated to the 
"news breaking nature" of the information itself, cause the requested information to 
qualify as “urgently needed.” 
 
AP2.2.3.3.3. Failure to obtain records quickly could cause imminent loss of substantial due 
process rights OR providing the information quickly would serve a "humanitarian need" 
(i.e., disclosing the information will promote the welfare and interests of mankind). While 
FOIA requests falling into these third and fourth categories can qualify for expedited 
processing, process them in the expedited track behind the requests qualifying for 
expedited processing based on "compelling need" (the first two types of expedited FOIA 
requests).  
 
AP2.2.4. Determine fee category of requester (Commercial/Educational—Noncommercial 
Scientific Institution—News Media/All Others) and assess fee issues. When all assessable 
costs are $25.00 or less, waive fees automatically for all categories of requesters. Assess 
other fee waiver or reduction requests on a case-by-case basis. See Chapter 6. 
 
AP2.2.5. Apply fee waiver/fee reduction criteria in appropriate cases (when requester asks 
for fee waiver/reduction).  
 
AP2.2.6. Find the Responsive Air Force Records (if any).  
 
AP2.2.6.1. Send the request to the appropriate OPR to search for responsive records and 
to decide whether to recommend release of any responsive records. Include a DD Form 
2086, or a DD Form 2086-1, in each request. The OPR must complete and return the 
appropriate forms and statements to the FOIA RSC. 
 
AP2.2.6.2. If the OPR find no responsive records, or desire to withhold any responsive 
records from release to the requester, the OPR must provide a written certificate detailing 
either their unsuccessful search, or their reasons why the documents should be withheld 
from release under the FOIA A; the written OPR statements must accompany the copies 
of the records the OPR desires to withhold as the FOIA action is processed (e.g., include it 
in any denial or appeal file). NOTE: If any part of a FOIA request is denied, and the 
requester appeals that denial, include all forms, certificates and documents prepared by 
the OPR in the FOIA appeal package in Tab 5 (see paragraph AP2.5). 
 
AP2.3. Contacts with FOIA Requesters and Non-Air Force Submitters of Data 
  
AP2.3.1. Contacts with Air Force Elements. A FOIA request is considered "received" (and 
therefore ready to process) when the FOIA office responsible for processing the request 
physically receives it, when the requester states a willingness to pay fees set for the 
appropriate fee category, and, if applicable, when the requester has paid any past FOIA 
debts and has reasonably described the requested records. Keep proper notes of all 
memoranda pertaining to requester contacts with Air Force elements regarding a pending 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
REFERENCES 
74 
FOIA request and/or attach a copy in the correspondence log in eFOIA. If the requester 
contacts Air Force elements telephonically about a pending FOIA request, the Air Force 
member participating in the conversation must prepare notes or memorandums for 
record (MFR), and log those notes in the requester's FOIA file in eFOIA. If any part of a 
FOIA request is denied, and the requester appeals that denial, submit documentation of 
requester contacts with Air Force elements in chronological order in the FOIA appeal 
package in Tab 1 (see paragraph AP2.5). 
 
AP2.3.2. Contacts with the FOIA Requester. See Appendix 1 for samples of language to use 
in various types of Air Force FOIA letters. If any part of a FOIA request is denied, and the 
requester appeals that denial, submit documents sent by Air Force elements to the 
requester (except for the denial letter, which will be in Tab 3) in the FOIA appeal package 
in Tab 5 in chronological order (see paragraph AP2.5). Letters that Air Force FOIA RSC 
may need to send to a FOIA requester include:  
 
AP2.3.2.1. An initial notification letter that the FOIA request was received. 
 
AP2.3.2.1.1. This letter may advise the requester that processing of the FOIA request may 
be delayed because:  
 
AP2.3.2.1.1.1. All or part of the requested records are not located at the installation 
processing the FOIA request (see paragraph AP2.3.2.2).   
 
AP2.3.2.1.1.2. An enormous number of records must be collected and reviewed.  
 
AP2.3.2.1.1.3. Other Air Force activities or other agencies, to include (if applicable) the 
nongovernment submitter of information, need to be involved in deciding whether or not to 
release the records.  
 
AP2.3.2.1.1.4. If you cannot complete processing of a FOIA request within 20 workdays, 
advise the requester of the reasons for the delay and give a date (within 30 workdays after 
receiving the request) when the requester can expect a final decision. 
 
AP2.3.2.1.2. The initial notification letter may advise the requester that all/part of the 
request was referred to another Air Force element or government activity.  
 
AP2.3.2.1.3. (Added)(AF) The initial notification letter may advise the requester of the 
appropriate fee category. In cases where fees are appropriate, and requesters have not 
agreed to pay for responsive records and fees are likely to be more than $25.00, seek 
assurances that the requester agrees to pay appropriate fees with a 10-working days 
suspense. If more information is needed to make a fee category determination, or to 
determine whether fees should be waived/reduced, inform the requester and provide a 10-
working days suspense for response. FOIA RSC may determine fee waiver/reduction 
requests before processing a FOIA request; if a fee waiver/reduction request is denied, the 
requester may appeal that denial; he/she may also appeal an adverse fee category 
determination (e.g., asked for news media fees, but was assessed commercial fees.) 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018

75 
 
AP2.3.2.1.4. (Added)(AF) The initial notification letter may advise the requester the 
request does not sufficiently describe the desired records and provide a 10-working days 
suspense for response. If possible, help the requester identify the requested records by 
explaining what kind of information would make searching for responsive records easier. 
 
AP2.3.2.1.5. If Air Force elements can complete a FOIA request within the statutory 20-
workday processing period, you may elect to send only a single letter to the requester, 
along with responsive records that are released to the requester in full.  
 
AP2.3.2.2. A letter to the requester that the responding FOIA office uses multitrack 
processing due to a significant number of pending requests that prevents a response 
determination from being made within 20 workdays. This letter advises the FOIA 
requester the track the request is in (simple/complex); in this letter, if expedited processing 
was requested, the requester is advised if the request will be expedited or not. If the request 
is found to be complex, you must advise the requester that he/she may alter the FOIA 
request to simplify processing. If it is determined the request will not be expedited, the 
requester must be told that he/she can appeal. (This may be the initial letter to the 
requester, for Air Force elements with multitrack processing; if that is the case, this letter 
may include sections discussed in paragraph AP2.3.2.1.) 
 
AP2.3.2.3. Subsequent letters to the requester on various subjects (for example, releasing 
requested records; advising reasons for delays; responding to the letters, facsimiles or calls; 
advising the requester of referrals to other Air Force units or government activities; 
involves a non-Air Force submitter, etc.).  
 
AP2.3.2.4. A release letter to the requester, forwarding releasable responsive records with a 
bill (if appropriate). 
 
AP2.3.2.5. A "no records" response letter to the requester if there are no responsive 
records, or, a denial letter, if any responsive records are withheld from release. FOIA 
Managers may sign "no records" or "requested format not available" responses; they may 
also sign a letter that advises a requester the fee category sought was not determined to be 
appropriate, or that a fee waiver/fee reduction request was disapproved, or that a request 
for expedited processing has been denied. An IDA must sign any letter or document 
withholding responsive records. When denying records, you must tell the requester, in 
writing: the name and title or position of the official who made the denial determination, 
the basis for the denial in enough detail to permit the requester to make a decision 
concerning appeal, and the FOIA exemptions on which the denial is based. The denial 
letter must include a brief statement describing what the exemptions cover.  When the 
initial denial is based (in whole or in part) on a security classification, this explanation 
should include a summary of the applicable executive order criteria for classification, as 
well as an explanation of how those criteria apply to the particular record in question. 
Estimate the volume of the records denied and provide this estimate to the requester, 
unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an exemption of the 
FOIA. This estimate should be in number of pages or, for records in other media, in some 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018 
REFERENCES 
76 
other reasonable form of estimation, unless the volume is otherwise indicated through 
deletions on records disclosed in part. Indicate the size and location of the redactions on the 
records released. You must also tell the requester how he/she can appeal the denial and 
provide Air Force FOIA Public Liaison and Office of Government Information Services 
contact information. 
 
AP2.3.3. Contacts with Non-Air Force Submitters of Data. Before releasing data 
(information or records) submitted from outside the Air Force, determine whether you 
need to write to the submitter of the data for their views on releasability of their data. In 
many cases, this non-Air Force data may fall under FOIA Exemption 4. If it appears you 
must contact the submitter of the data, advise the requester in writing that you must give 
the submitter of the data the opportunity to comment before the Air Force decides whether 
to release the information. Give the submitter 5 working days to object to release and 
provide justification for withholding the documents. If the submitter does not respond, 
advise the submitter in writing that you have not received a reply and plan to release the 
records. Provide the submitter with the reasons the Air Force will release the records, and 
give the submitter your expected release date (5 working days from the date of your letter). 
This permits the submitter time to seek a temporary restraining order in federal court, if 
they can convince the judge to issue such an order. See Appendix 1 for samples of language 
to use in Air Force letters to both the FOIA requester and nongovernment submitters. 
Remember to include a copy of Appendix 3 as an attachment to the letter sent to the 
nongovernment submitter. 
 
AP2.3.3.1. The notice requirements of this section need not be followed if the Air Force 
determines that the information should not be disclosed, the information has been lawfully 
published or officially made available to the public, or disclosure of the information is 
required by law. 
 
AP2.3.3.2. (Added)(AF) If the submitter objects to release of the records, but the Air Force 
disclosure authority considers the records releasable, tell the submitter before releasing the 
data. Include in the letter to the submitter a brief explanation and a specific release date at 
least 5 working days from the date of the letter. This permits the submitter time to seek a 
temporary restraining order in federal court, if they can convince the judge to issue such 
an order. Advise the submitter once a determination is made that release of the data is 
required under the FOIA, failure to oppose the proposed release will lead to release of 
submitted data. Also advise the requester such a release under the FOIA will result in the 
released information entering the public domain, and that subsequent requests for the 
same information will be answered without any formal coordination between the Air Force 
and the submitter, unless the information is later amended, changed, or modified. A person 
equal to, or higher in rank than, the denial authority makes the final decision to disclose 
responsive records over the submitter's objection.  
 
AP2.3.3.3. When a previously released contract document has been modified, any contract 
documents not in existence at the time of an earlier FOIA request that are responsive to a 
later FOIA request for the same contract, will be processed as a first-time FOIA request for 
those newly created documents. Notify the nongovernment submitter of the pending FOIA 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018

77 
action, and give them the same opportunity to respond as is detailed above. Passage of a 
significant period of time since the prior FOIA release can also require Air Force elements 
to comply with the notice requirements in this paragraph.  
 
AP2.4. Denying All or Part of a Request. When responsive records are withheld from 
release (denied), the appropriate offices must prepare a denial package for the IDA. Air 
Force elements must send the request, related documents, and responsive records through 
their IDA FOIA office to the IDA for a decision. The denial package must include:  
 
AP2.4.1. The FOIA request and any modifications by the requester. 
 
AP2.4.2. A copy of the responsive records, including both records that may be released and 
records recommended for denial.  
 
AP2.4.3. Written recommendations from the OPR, and an Air Force attorney.  
 
AP2.4.4. The exemptions cited and a discussion of how the records qualify for withholding 
under the FOIA. 
 
AP2.4.4.1. This discussion should also include the reasons for denial: to deny release of 
responsive records requested under the FOIA, it must be determined that disclosure of the 
records would result in a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by a FOIA exemption 
(or exemptions), that the record is exempt from release under one or more of the 
exemptions of the FOIA, and that a discretionary release is not appropriate. 
 
AP2.4.5. Any collateral documents that relate to the requested records. For example:  
AP2.4.5.1. If the requested records came from a non-Air Force or non-U.S. Federal 
Government submitter, include any documents from the submitter that relate to the release 
or denial of the requested records. If unsure of whether or not the non-Air Force or non- 
U.S. Federal Government submitted information is potentially exempt from release under 
the FOIA, contact an Air Force attorney FOIA Exemptions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 may apply.  
 
AP2.4.5.2. If the requested records came from Privacy Act systems of records, include a 
written discussion of any Privacy Act issues.  
 
AP2.4.5.3. If any requested records came from another Air Force element, or release of the 
requested records would affect another Air Force element, the FOIA RSC should 
coordinate with that other element. If the FOIA request is not completely referred to the 
other element, include documents from that element. 
 
AP2.4.5.4. If any of the requested records are classified, include a written certification from 
a classification authority or declassification authority stating the data was properly 
classified originally, that it remains properly classified (per Executive Order 13526), and, if 
applicable, that no reasonably segregable portions can be released (see paragraph 
C3.2.1.1).

AP2.5. FOIA Appeal Actions  
 
AP2.5.1. If an IDA, or a FOIA office responding on behalf of an IDA, withholds a record 
from release because they determine the record is exempt under one or more of the 
exemptions to the FOIA, the requester may appeal that decision, in writing, to the 
Secretary of the Air Force.  The appeal should be accompanied by a copy of the denial 
letter. FOIA appeals should be postmarked within 90 calendar days after the date of the 
denial letter, and should contain the reasons the requester disagrees with the initial denial. 
Late appeals may be rejected, either by the element initially processing the FOIA appeal, 
or by subsequent denial authorities, if the requester does not provide adequate justification 
for the delay. Appeal procedures also apply to the denial of a fee category claim by a 
requester, denial of a request for waiver or reduction of fees, disputes regarding fee 
estimates, review on an expedited basis of a determination not to grant expedited access to 
agency records, and for "no record" or "requested format not available" determinations 
when the requester considers such responses adverse in nature.  
 
AP2.5.2. Coordinate appeals with an Air Force attorney (and the OPR, if appropriate) so 
they can consider factual and legal arguments raised in the appeal, and can prepare 
written assessments of issues raised in the appeal to assist the IDA in considering the 
appeal. FOIA RSC and SAF/AAII (for OPR at HQ USAF and SAF), send all appeals to the 
Secretary of the Air Force through Air Force Legal Operations Agency, General Litigation 
Division (AFLOA /JACL) for consideration, unless the IDA has reconsidered the initial 
denial action, and granted the appeal. 
 
AP2.5.3. If a requester appeals a "no records" determination, organizations must search 
again or verify the adequacy of their first search (for example, if a second search would be 
fruitless, the organization may include a signed statement from either the records OPR or 
the FOIA Manager detailing why another search was not practical). The appeal package 
must include documents (to include a certification from the records OPR) that show how 
the organization tried to find responsive records. In the event a requester sues the Air 
Force to contest a determination that no responsive records exist, formal affidavits will be 
required to support the adequacy of any searches conducted. 
 
AP2.5.4. General Administrative Matters. FOIA requesters may ultimately sue the Air 
Force in federal court if they are dissatisfied with adverse determinations. In these suits, 
the contents of the administrative appeal file are evaluated to determine whether the Air 
Force complied with the FOIA and its own guidance. Improper or inadequate appeal files 
make defending these cases problematic. Include all the documents related to the 
requester's FOIA action in the appeal file. If appeal file documents are sensitive, or are 
classified up to the SECRET level, send them separately to AFLOA/JACL, 1500 West 
Perimeter Road, Suite 1370 Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762. Make separate arrangements 
with AFLOA/JACL for processing classified appeal file documents TOP SECRET or 
higher. Cover letters on appeal packages need to list all attachments. If a FOIA action is 
complicated, a chronology of events helps reviewers understand what happened in the 
course of the request and appeal. If an appeal file does not include the documentation 
described below, include the tab, and insert a page marked "not applicable," "N/A," or 
DODM 5400.07_AFMAN 33-302  27 APRIL 2018

"not used." DO NOT renumber the tabs and move the other items up. If any part of the 
requester's appeal is denied, the appeal package must include a signed statement by the 
IDA, demonstrating that the IDA considered and rejected the requester's arguments, and 
the basis for that decision. This may be a separate memorandum, an endorsement on a 
legal opinion or OPR opinion, or the cover letter which forwards the appeal for final 
determination. Include in the cover letter forwarding the appeal to the Secretary of the Air 
Force the name, phone number and e-mail address (if any) of the person to contact about 
the appeal. The order and contents of appeal file attachments follow. 
 
AP2.5.4.1. Tab 1, the original appeal letter and envelope.  
 
AP2.5.4.2. Tab 2, the initial FOIA request, any modifications of the request by the 
requester or any other communications from the requester, in chronological order.

records released are ― massive [which means "several cubic feet"] and AFLOA/JACL 
agrees, an index or description of the records may be provided in place of the released 
records. Do not send appeal files without copies of released records without the express 
agreement of AFLOA/JACL. Usually AFLOA/JACL requires all the released records in 
appeal files. If the released records are not sent to AFLOA/JACL when a FOIA requester 
has appealed a partial denial, retain a copy of what was released for 6 years. 
 
AP2.5.4.5. Tab 5, copies of all administrative processing documents, including extension 
letters, search descriptions, and initial OPR recommendations about the request, in 
chronological order.  
 
AP2.5.4.6. Tab 6, copies of the denied records or portions marked to show what was 
withheld. If your organization uses a single set of highlighted records (to show items 
redacted from records released to the requester), ensure the records are legible and insert a 
page in either Tab 4 or Tab 6 stating all records are contained in the other tab. An index of 
denied documents may be helpful, if there are a number of items. If the records denied are 
“massive” [which means "several cubic feet"] and AFLOA/JACL agrees, an index or 
description of the records may be provided in place of the denied records. Do not send 
appeal files without copies of denied records without the express agreement of 
AFLOA/JACL. Usually AFLOA/JACL requires all the denied records in appeal files. If the 
denied records are not sent to AFLOA/JACL, when a FOIA requester has appealed a 
denial, retain a copy of what was denied for 6 years. 
 
AP2.5.4.7. Tab 7, place all legal opinions, in chronological order, in this tab.  Include a 
point-by-point discussion of factual and legal arguments in the requester's appeal 
(prepared by an Air Force attorney and/or the OPR). If the IDA does not state in the cover 
letter he/she signed that he/she considered and rejected the requester's arguments and

assessments of the requester's arguments), include a signed, written statement containing 
the same information from the IDA in this tab, either as a separate document or an

process for intra-agency documents denied under the deliberative process privilege and 
how the denied material fits into that process (if applicable).

(Added)(AF) AP3. APPENDIX 3 
REQUIREMENT OF TITLE 5 UNITED STATES CODE SECTION 552(b)(4) 
TO SUBMITTERS OF NONGOVERNMENT CONTRACT-RELATED INFORMATION  
 
AP3.1. General. The FOIA requires federal agencies to provide their records, except those 
specifically exempted, for the public to inspect and copy. Section (b) of the Act lists nine 
exemptions that are the only basis for withholding records from the public.  
 
AP3.1.1. In this case, the fourth exemption, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), may apply to records or 
information the Air Force maintains. Under this exemption, agencies must withhold trade 
secrets and commercial or financial information they obtained from a person or 
organization outside the government that is privileged or confidential. This may include 
information provided and received during the contracting process with the understanding 
that the Air Force will keep it privileged or confidential.  
 
AP3.1.2. Commercial or financial matter is “confidential” and exempt if its release would 
likely:  
 
AP3.1.2.1. Impair the government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future.  
 
AP3.1.2.2. Substantially harm the source’s competitive position or impair some other 
legitimate government interest such as compliance and program effectiveness.  
 
AP3.2. Applicability of Exemption. The exemption may be used to protect information 
provided by a nongovernment submitter when public disclosure would likely cause 
substantial harm to its competitive position. Examples of information that may qualify for 
this exemption include:  
 
AP3.2.1. Commercial or financial information received in confidence with loans, bids, 
contracts, or proposals, as well as other information received in confidence or privileged, 
such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data. (NOTE: Certain 
proprietary and source selection information may also fall under exemption (b)(3), under 
the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) or 41 USC 423, if statutory requirements are met.)  
 
AP3.2.2. Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract 
performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, offered and received in confidence 
from a contractor or potential contractor.  
 
AP3.2.3. Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or audits, received 
and kept in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial 
information, normally considered confidential or privileged.  
 
AP3.2.4. Financial data that private employers give in confidence for local wage surveys 
used to set and adjust pay schedules for the prevailing wage rate of DoD employees.

AP3.2.5. Information about scientific and manufacturing processes or developments that is 
technical or scientific or other information submitted with a research grant application, or 
with a report while research is in progress.  
 
AP3.2.6. Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor develops entirely at 
private expense, and technical or scientific data developed partly with Federal funds and 
partly with private funds, in which the contractor or subcontractor retains legitimate

AP3.2.7. Computer software copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (Title 17  
U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would adversely impact its potential market value.  
 
AP3.2.8. Information voluntarily submitted, if the submitter would not normally release 
such information to the public.  
 
AP3.3. Submitter’s Written Response. If release of the requested material would prejudice 
your commercial interests, give detailed written reasons that identify the specific 
information and the competitive harm public release will cause to you, your organization, 
or your business. The Act requires the Air Force to provide any reasonably segregable part 
of a record after deleting exempt portions.  If deleting key words or phrases would 
adequately protect your interests, advise us in writing which portions you believe we can 
safely release, and which portions you believe we need to withhold from release.  If you do 
not provide details on the probability of substantial harm to your competitive position or 
other commercial interests, which would be caused by releasing your material to the 
requester, we may be required to release the information. Records qualify for protection on 
a case by case basis. 
 
AP3.4. Pricing Information. Generally, the prices a contractor charges the government for 
goods or services would be released under the FOIA. Examples of releasable data include 
(a) the winning bid submitted in response to an invitation for bids (IFB), (b) amounts 
actually paid by the government under a contract, and (c) line item prices, contract award 
price, and modifications to a contract.  Unit prices contained in a contract award are 
considered releasable as part of the post award notification procedure prescribed by the 
Title 48 CFR. Only winning contractor information is releasable under 10 USC § 2305(g).
