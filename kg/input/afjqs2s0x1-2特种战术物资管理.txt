1.  PURPOSE.  This AFJQS identifies tasks and duty requirements for individuals 
performing Materiel Management duties within a Special Tactics unit.  This AFJQS will be 
available on the Air Force e-Publishing Site and eventually be migrated into Air Force My 
Training.  This must be used to develop the Master Training Plan (MTP) for Special Tactics 
Materiel Managers and any Individual Training Records (ITR). This AFJQS will remain in 
effect until superseded or rescinded. 
 
2.  TASK QUALIFICATION.  Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard for all 
tasks listed in this AFJQS.  GO means the individual can perform/identify the task, without 
assistance, utilizing appropriate instructions, training references, or other procedural guidance.  
If the required training listed in Part II of this AFJQS is provided, a supervisor/trainer from the 
2S0 functionality will complete the trainer’s block to document training completion. 
 
3.  ADDITIONAL DUTY or TASK. If personnel are assigned an additional duty or task not listed in 
this AFJQS, the supervisor will develop an AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/ 
Command JQS. The supervisor/trainer will then develop a plan for their trainees to receive training 
and become duty position qualified.  
 
4.  TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION.  
Document training required by this AFJQS in accordance with DAFMAN 36-2689, Training 
Program.  For civilian personnel, document training on Supervisor-Employee-Brief-971. 
 
5.  This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable CFMs. Overall POC for this AFJQS 
is HAF/A4LR, DSN 223-5021, AF.A4LR.Workflow@us.af.mil.
