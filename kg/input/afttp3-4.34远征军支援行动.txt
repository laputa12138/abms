Chapter 1
CH1 COMMAND AND CONTROL
COMMAND AND CONTROL
1.1. Command and Control. The Department of Air Force command and control (C2)
enterprise consists of the people, organizations, processes, procedures, information,
communications, facilities, and systems used to plan, direct, coordinate, and control forces and
operations. C2 is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over
assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.
1.2. Responsibilities. Expeditionary force support squadron (EFSS) leaders and those assigned to
lead unit type code (UTC) positions are responsible for providing beddown planning, C2,
accountability and casualty reporting, readiness management, control center operations, mortuary
capabilities, war reserve material (WRM) management, food operations, postal operations, and
official mail.
1.2.1. Elements. Using their C2 systems, commanders exercise C2 to direct operations. The
first element of a C2 system is people—people who acquire information, make decisions, take
action, communicate, and collaborate with one another to accomplish a common goal. The
second element of the C2 system is comprised of the facilities, equipment, communications,
staff functions, and procedures essential to a commander to plan, direct, monitor, and control
operations of assigned forces pursuant to the missions assigned.
1.2.2. UTC. EFSS lead UTCs provide the personnel necessary for establishing the
expeditionary force support squadron (EFSS). EFSS lead UTCs are RFLXH—agile lead team,
RFLXA—EFSS lead team, and RFLXB—EFSS C2 team.
1.3. Establish C2 and Operations Center. Verify the EFSS chain of command has all EFSS
units under an EFSS commander.
1.3.1. Communications. Ensure that lines of communication by telephone, email, radio, and
cell phone are adequate. If the lines are not secure, closely manage operational aspects of
discussions.
1.3.1.1. Email. All email traffic containing controlled unclassified information (CUI) or
personally identifiable information (PII) should be digitally signed and encrypted. For
continuity purposes, units should use electronic database files for record keeping, trend
analysis, and printing of standard forms.
1.3.1.2. Establish communications with expeditionary mission support group (EMSG)
commander, emergency operations center, and installation command center.
1.3.1.3. Establish communications with theater component-numbered Air Force [C-NAF]
A1 representative and provide list of available contact methods, names, and numbers.
1.3.1.4. Determine requirements for secure radio and telephone.
1.3.1.5. Establish secure e-mail (Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network
[NIPRNET] and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network [SIPRNET]) and internet
connection for computers.
1.3.1.6. Develop a list of other requirements that are needed (e.g., laptop
capability/network connectivity for EFSS workcenters).
 
 
1-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
1.3.2. Control Center. Control centers vary depending on the resources, capabilities, and
mission of a respective group or squadron on the installation. They provide a focal point
within an organization to monitor unit resources and mission capability and to coordinate their
activities during major accident, natural disaster, and adversary attack response operations.
1.3.2.1. All control centers should identify an alternate location which is a minimum of
2,000 feet from the primary control center location. This will ensure a single event will not
place the alternate inside a hazardous cordon. The alternate location should have sufficient
equipment and supplies to operate without loss of continuity.
1.3.2.2. At a minimum, each control center should possess current on-base grid maps,
control center checklists, computers, telephones, and the control center binders. Units
should maintain paper control center binders in case of power failure, computer failure,
relocation, or required use by untrained personnel. Control centers maintain unit-specific
checklists for activation, operations, deactivation, and relocation/evacuation. These
checklists should be updated as needed with appropriate procedures, contacts, and
responsibilities.
1.3.2.3. Event logs are required for tracking all control center operations. These event logs
can be tracked on paper or electronically, but should be stored electronically to enable
distribution after the event. These logs will be used to identify discrepancies, significant
issues, and impact lessons learned. See Table 1.1, Event Log Example.

1.3.2.4. Status boards are an effective means of consolidating critical or reportable data. It
streamlines the ability to track, control, and disseminate information. It facilitates
discussion among the team to create solutions to minor issues or significant courses of
action. This does not have to be a board, but rather a place to centralize information that is
coming in from various activities or reporting channels. See Table 1.2, Status Board
Example.

that EFSS unit control center (UCC) has at least an information copy of everything equipment
related (if they are not managing it).
1.3.3.1. EFSS UCC should coordinate tracking EFSS beddown functions and worksites.
1.3.3.2. Track contingency quarters arrivals and compare personnel with personnel
support for contingency operations (PERSCO).
1.3.3.3. Establish joint reception function as necessary.

1.3.3.6. Maintain updated information and data for essential elements required for upward
reporting (theater and major command [MAJCOM]).
1.3.3.7. EFSS leaders will need to work many issues, including keeping close tabs on
control and accountability of assets. Accountability of personnel is one of the most
important initial considerations after arriving at a deployed location and it is the primary
mission of the unit’s PERSCO team.
1.3.3.8. At least one mode of communication should be operable for the commander’s
timely implementation of orders. Most control center communications will be through
email or telephone. Other less frequent methods may include land mobile radios (LMR)
and face-to-face.
1.3.3.9. The cell phone deserves special mention and consideration. Official cell phones
are a legitimate means of communication where they are allowed. Personal cell phones
will not be used for exercise or inspection command and control communications. Cell
phones should never be used to pass sensitive or classified information.
1.3.3.10. LMR may be used to broadcast information to an unlimited number of receivers.
It may also be used for two-way communications. Radios, by nature, are vulnerable to
intercept even when encrypted, so LMR messages should not include classified or
sensitive information.
1.3.3.11. The Giant Voice system is used to transmit messages in accordance with
command post guidance. Messages from Giant Voice should also be relayed on LMRs.
1.3.3.12. Runners may act as couriers of classified information, carriers of messages, or
transporters of critically needed items. Runners face security risks of intercept, time
constraints based on distance and security requirements, and contamination risks. Based
on these factors, a runner is often one of the last resorts for communication
1.3.3.13. It is imperative that strict entry control, classified material handling, information
protection, communications security (COMSEC), and operations security (OPSEC)
practices are observed at all times by control center members.
1.3.3.14. For entry into restricted areas, each UCC should follow the procedures
established for each particular area. All personnel entering an area with classified
information should be on an entry access list (EAL) and have a minimum SECRET
clearance verified through the appropriate security manager. Personnel not on an EAL
should be escorted.
1.3.3.15. When answering telephones ensure everyone around is aware that a telephone is
in use by stating “PHONE UP.” Do not discuss classified information over unsecure
telephones or LMRs. Do not talk around classified information over telephones or radios.
Use only secure communications systems to transmit classified information.
1.3.4. COMSEC. COMSEC protection results from applying security measures (i.e., crypto
security, transmission security, and emission security) to communications and information
systems generating, handling, storing, processing, or using classified, sensitive government, or
government-derived information, the loss of which could adversely affect national security
interests. It is essential to ensure that there are proper procedures in place for handling this
type of information.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
1.3.5. Situation Report (SITREP). The SITREP is a narrative report that keeps addressees
informed and enables higher levels of command to prepare for potential effects of ongoing
situations. SITREPs are submitted daily, or as required, for the duration of the activity or
operation.
1.3.5.1. SITREPs evaluate significant factors relating primarily to readiness, programs,
and logistics.
1.3.5.2. The report’s content should highlight key activities and build on previous reports.
Duplicating or including information to fill in the blank is not desirable—brevity is
paramount.
1.3.5.3. SITREPs are required in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 10-206,
Operational Reporting (OPREP) and local guidance. Refer to combatant command
classification guidance.
1.3.6. After Action Reports (AAR). AARs may be published in the Joint Lessons Learned
Information System (JLLIS). Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-1302, Air Force Lessons Learned
Program, provides procedures for documenting exercise and operations results, identifying
and correcting problems, identifying trends, and disseminating results.
1.4. EFSS. The EFSS is the basic force support element of the air expeditionary task force
(AETF) providing combat support to air expeditionary wing and air expeditionary groups.
1.4.1. Organization. Developing a structure to most efficiently build the EFSS community
for defense planning guidance relies on establishing a foundation for manpower authorization
resourcing. The requirements for this structure are determined by Department of Defense
(DOD) and Air Force guidance and not planning factors within the force support community.
The community adheres to this guidance by determining the requirements and develops the
structure within the organization to support operational planning. See Figure 1.1, EFSS
Organization Example.

1.4.2. Expeditionary Force Support Deployment Capabilities. Deployed EFSS leaders are
responsible for directing their Airmen, equipment, and other assigned resources towards
delivering combat support capabilities to assigned warfighters across the full range of military
operations.
1.4.2.1. EFSS deployment capabilities include beddown planning, personnel
accountability, contingency quarters, feeding operations, casualty reporting, mortuary
operations, postal operations, official mail function, fitness and recreation, readiness
management and planning, non-appropriated funds, Airman and Family Readiness,
Learning and Resource Center, education and training, manpower and organization, and
limited personnel program support. EFSS leadership provides functional guidance for
sexual assault prevention response, protocol programs, and equal opportunity programs.
1.4.2.2. Personnel accountability ensures personnel are properly accounted for during
deployment by the PERSCO team. Trained PERSCO team members with a special
experience identifier use Deliberate Crisis Action Planning Execution Segments
(DCAPES) to maintain personnel accountability. This involves the tracking of every
Airman in a deployed location to give commanders across the entire force knowledge of
what type and how many Airmen are under their control thus enabling mission
accomplishment. PERSCO supports reception processing and provides limited personnel
program support and/or reach back assistance to deployed personnel.
1.4.2.3. Feeding operations procure, receive, inspect, store, sanitize, prepare, serve, and
dispose of food items. During beddown operations, forces are provided with meals
ready-to-eat. As operations progress, unitized group rations are prepared with the goal to
transition to hot meals using fresh and frozen items or A-rations. Food operations provide
the fuel Airmen need to perform their combat missions. Every mission requires healthy
and diverse food options, despite the location or the hardships involved.
1.4.2.4. Contingency quarters operations house personnel, supply furnishings and
necessary items, provide a personnel locator, manage non-appropriated fund resale, and
provide laundry operations for Airmen. It adapts available fixed facilities, erects shelters,
and procures contracts to provide housing for Airmen. This capability provides an
environment where Airmen can rest and regenerate to perform future missions. By
considering the rest factor, sanitation, fire and ground safety, force support personnel can
ensure successful sustainment of human resources in any environment or location.
1.4.2.5. Fitness operations include designing exercise programs (directed and
self-directed), procuring and maintaining equipment, enhancing mental and physical
health, and creating healthy diversions from combat activities. It adapts both outdoor and
indoor facilities to provide opportunities to keep Airmen resilient and fit to fight. It
operates in all environments and locations to deliver mentally and physically capable
Airmen across the full spectrum of military operations.
1.4.2.6. Casualty provides notification to leadership and completes casualty reporting of
service-members who are ill, injured, deceased, wounded, or killed in action. Mortuary
operates under extreme conditions to identify, track deceased personnel, and care for the
remains of fallen personnel. Mortuary will care for and arrange shipment of the fallen
Airmen out of the theater of operations.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
1-9
 
 
1.4.2.7. Airmen regeneration procures entertainment and creates other resilience-building
methods to cope with work stress and family separation anxiety by allowing for
decompression and regeneration of Airmen. This capability is provided through multiple
mediums (virtual, tactile, creative, and developmental) and programs (directed and
self-directed). Airmen regeneration efforts begin once the base is open for operations,
providing diversion from the hardships and family separations our Airmen may endure.
This capability is difficult to perform in a deployed environment and requires great
creativity and marketing efforts to make it successful. When developing programs,
consider diverse interests as well as events for both recurring and special occasions.
1.4.2.8. Developing and connecting Airmen to the outside world delivers intellectual
pursuits for both continued professional development, as well as mental diversions from
the daily realities faced during combat duty. Education and training and services
professionals deliver this capability at Learning Resource Centers and Testing Control
offices. These services connect Airmen and their families, facilitates professional military
education, and provides recreational reading. It supports Airmen by delivering both digital
and hard copy access (when available) to various media. The end effects are Airmen who
continue their professional and self-development efforts.
1.4.2.9. Alternative resource sourcing provides the ability to capitalize on various
financial resources and non-appropriated fund and appropriated fund contracts,
commercial sponsorship, private organizations, partnerships in alternate resourcing, and
non-appropriated fund memorandum of agreements. These different resources provide
alternative options to achieve commander objectives. These alternative resources enable
force support to offer programs, maintain service standards, execute programs
consistently, and provide backfill options during crisis or contingency operations.
1.4.2.10. Postal operations and official mail functions support Airmen with staying
connected to their families and receiving morale boosting items such as care packages,
essential personal care items, and other items not available for purchase in their deployed
location. Official mail functions provide a direct support path for deployed units to receive
supply requirements, official correspondence, and other resources at their deployed
location.
1.4.2.11. Manpower supports air expeditionary wings and subordinate units with
identifying force requirements, advising on organizational structures, creation, and
disposition of provisional units, defines command relationships, provides relocation
allocation assistance, evaluates and process requests for change requests to force
requirements and organization structures, communicates disposition of requests, and
provides resource advisory assistance as needed.
1.4.2.12. EFSS may also provide administrative support for additional capabilities
assigned at the air expeditionary wing. These capabilities include sexual assault and
response coordinator, protocol, and equal opportunity.
1.5. Leadership Expectations. Mission first, people always is more than just a saying; it is a
philosophy. In this idea of mission first, people always, one of these is no more important than the
other. The problem for leaders is that there is a tension faced in balancing mission and people.
There are leaders that are mission-focused and those that are people-focused. The leaders who are
 
 
1-10
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
capable of balancing mission and people are seen as the greatest leaders. These are the ones who
get the job done and their people are being cared for at the same time. Those leaders who are most
successful can integrate their social skills into their leadership style. Having good social skills
allows a leader to quickly recognize those things that impact mission accomplishment and take the
appropriate action. Successful leaders find a way to offset their focus on mission with a
personality with which people can connect.
1.5.1. Mission Success, Sometimes Failure. Failure is not always acceptable. Certain
missions or tasks may be no fail meaning they are so critical to the success of the organization
or larger mission that failure would result in disaster. In these cases, leaders may need to
reassess their risk tolerance. Effective leaders know when to push the limits and when to make
more conservative decisions. Leaders make difficult calculations based on the context at that
time. The fear of failure can definitely inhibit leaders, but leaders should take failure, learn
from it, and make the people around them and the organization better as a result.
1.5.2. Hit the Ground Running. Learn from the person being replaced (if there is one) to
quickly become the go-to person. Preplanning before departure from home station can assist
with getting an initial game plan on the ground and adjust from there. Be ready to work
immediately, sometimes right after arrival.
1.5.3. Commanders Call. The first commander’s call should be kept short and focus on
putting everyone at ease. The new team is probably nervous and anxious about the new
commander’s arrival so smile, learn names, and pay attention. Give the team the chance to ask
questions so they see communication is a two-way street. Be ready to discuss and address any
urgent needs impacting the health, morale, and welfare of the team.
1.5.4. People. Schedule individual meetings with each direct report as soon as possible to
better understand their strengths, ideas, and concerns. Take the time to say hello and make a
proper introduction if not already done. Ask them about their role, express excitement to lead,
and shape expectations for the first several weeks.
1.5.5. Leading a Diverse Team. Be visible, get to know their strengths and weaknesses, and
capitalize on their experiences and expertise. As a leader, understanding the challenges that
managing diverse teams represent can help identify policies for promoting an inclusive
culture. Being aware of these benefits and challenges can increase collaboration and more
effective communication. There are specific skills that leaders can cultivate to build a safe
environment for diverse teams to thrive.
1.5.5.1. Communication. Any leader should have sound communication skills. When
managing a diverse team, creating the conditions that encourage open communication
across the team demonstrates that diverse opinions are appreciated and respected. There
may be a need to master communicating effectively across different cultures, languages,
and generations.
1.5.5.2. Biases. It is natural to have biases. Good leaders exercise self-awareness to
identify their prejudices and those from the team. The leader should listen, promote
empathy, help to create communication channels to manage conflict, and enable everyone
to thrive and perform better.
1.5.5.3. Conflict Management. Conflict mediation should be seen as a constructive
exercise that enables the diversity of the team to be a catalyst for growth. Managing
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
1-11
 
 
conflict is a development opportunity for managers and can benefit the entire team as they
feel more comfortable voicing their unconventional ideas, disagreements, and proposals
for doing something innovative. Frequently, conflicts occur because of
miscommunication. The leader has a direct responsibility for adjudicating conflicts that
rise within the unit.
1.5.5.4. Emotional Intelligence and Self-Awareness. A leader’s self-awareness will
impact personal development and growth, but it will also play a relevant role in the success
of diverse teams. It is important to lead oneself first and then lead the team. A leader
should be conscious of their identity, style, strengths, and areas of improvement in order to
better understand and accept those same qualities from team members.
1.6. Expeditionary versus Enduring Mindset. This mindset is often a source of tension within
leadership teams. The length of presence at some locations has shifted the mindset to enduring
operations (e.g., Al Udeid, Ali Al Salem, and Al Dhafra). The enduring mindset improves quality
of life, living conditions, cleanliness, maintainability, and sustainability. Examples could be
transitioning contingency quarters from tents to trailers then trailers to hardened facilities,
upgrading the dining facilities, or something as simple as getting bacon, chocolate chip ice cream,
or having waffles and pancakes every Friday. Another example could be relaxing off base
restrictions. Host nation or status-of-forces agreements (SOFA) may prevent a location from
becoming enduring. As leaders, it is essential to convey to Wing leadership that these capabilities
do not exist when first establishing initial base operating support. Small wins matter in these
scenarios and engagement with the team to deliver those wins are critical.
1.7. Leading Up. Being a leader is not just about leading down, it is also about leading up. Keep
supervisors in the loop on the performance of the unit and the mission. Set up regular engagements
with supervisors to discuss goals and priorities to ensure proper focus and alignment of the team
with the commander’s purpose and intent.
1.7.1. Be Open Minded. Avoid tunnel vision and be open minded when evaluating a course
of action. Take everyone’s feedback into consideration before making a final decision. Do not
make promises that cannot be kept and it is acceptable to say “I do not know but I will get back
with you.”
1.7.2. Negotiation. Learn how to get to yes. If the person cannot give a yes, then a no does not
necessarily matter. Ensure to state proper and thorough justification for the decision when
engaging with a decision maker.
1.8. Roles as Leaders. Leaders have the ability to alter the course of the mission. Leaders should
set the example, do what is right, set clear expectations, establish standards, and keep personnel
informed with respect to those expectations and standards. Do the right thing means constantly
striving for improvement, addressing problems directly, and working to find a solution to fix them.
1.8.1. Good Order and Discipline. Good order and discipline are essential elements to
mission accomplishment. The maintaining of good order and discipline sometimes calls for a
supervisor or commander to intervene and advocate for the best interest of their Airmen. Other
times it includes the imposition of administrative censures or even non-judicial or judicial
punishment. Maintaining an atmosphere of good order and discipline is really a matter of how
one perceives their surroundings.
 
 
1-12
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
1.8.1.1. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is an integral part of maintaining
good order and discipline. There will be some hard cases that require extensive personal
attention and those members should be dealt with systematically on a case by case basis.
1.8.1.2. The postponement of disciplinary action can cause conditions to deteriorate to the
point where severe measures become necessary. Good order and discipline keeps
operations running smoothly and provides for a chaos free working environment.
1.8.2. Establish Trust. Get to know the team on a personal level in order to build trust and set
clear professional boundaries. Take the time to discuss hobbies, life goals, and anything else
going on outside of work. This will not only establish a rapport but can provide better insight
into team members to harness their best qualities and passions.
1.8.2.1. Conduct regular one-on-one check-ins and do not cancel them. Set office hours so
the team can ask questions as well as have availability for any emergencies. The team
wants one-on-one time with their leader and this is a great opportunity to keep an eye on
their progress. Ask about challenges they are facing and ideas they may have to improve
matters.
1.8.2.2. It is important to listen. As a new leader, it is tempting to start out with some bold
moves. Show the team first that their ideas are important and incorporate them into future
plans. Be straightforward and honest with everyone and expect the same in return. Follow
through on commitments and do not over promise and under deliver.
1.8.3. Set the Example. The team is going to look to their leader to set the example.
Demonstrate values, techniques to tackle challenges, and methods to handle adversity. The
best strategy is to be patient and keep emotions in check. Do not be reactive. Slow down and
get all of the information before making a decision.
1.8.3.1. Attitude, Customer Service, Excellence, Integrity, Teamwork (ACE IT). Attitude
is contagious; never have a bad day in public. There will be challenging days when not at
peak performance but do not transfer that on to a supervisor, coworkers, or customers.
1.8.4. Consistency. Consistency will build confidence within the team. To be consistent, be
patient. Leadership means taking the time needed to make the right decision. Be deliberate,
thorough, and review all the facts before rendering a decision. Consistent, considerate decision
making will benefit the team.
1.8.5. Take Care of the Team. Ensure a healthy work and life balance to build resilience and
improve the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of the team. Find creative ways to
reduce stress in the organization. It could be something as simple as having a movie night,
closing the office door to play a game of foosball, having breakfast together as a team, or
working out together. See Figure 1.2, Life Balance.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
1-13
 
 
Figure 1.2. Life Balance
1.8.5.1. Connect people to the meaning of their work. When people see how their work
contributes to the mission, benefits others, and serves a greater purpose, they tend to
perform better. Every job has purpose, no matter how small the contribution. When
individuals have a sense of purpose and can tie their everyday tasks to a bigger cause, they
will have pride in their work.
1.8.5.2. Making the team feel valued is another big component of taking care of the team
(e.g., public recognition, giving increased levels of responsibility, feedback, asking for
their opinion, or simply saying thank you). Instead of micromanaging their day, provide
direction and let them take the lead.
1.9. Lessons Learned. Get comfortable operating in the gray. As a leader keep an open mind and
get comfortable navigating through gray zones while ensuring decisions are legal, ethical, and
moral. Confirmation bias is a phenomenon that causes people to narrow their thinking when they
have already locked on to an expectation or perspective. A leader that is comfortable with the
uncertainty of the gray areas of leadership is more open and tolerant to changes in the plan,
shifting priorities, and various other unclear circumstances in the mission.
1.9.1. Prioritization Matters. Although some leaders might thrive when work is
overwhelming, leaders should utilize delegation and leverage the skills of their team to
accomplish the mission. Delegate tasks based on the strengths of each team member and then
trust them to do their job. This is a real sign of an effective leader.
1-14

1.9.2. Chain of Command. Remain flexible and adapt to the different leadership styles in the
chain of command. Regardless of the leadership style, adapt accordingly and lead the team in
accomplishing the mission.
1.9.3. Handling People Issues. Airmen will have personal or work-related issues (e.g.,
deaths, divorces, births, finance trouble, depression, fights, addictions, suicidal thoughts,
insubordination, incompetency, inappropriate relationships, and General Order 1 violations).
As a leader, deal with them immediately to limit the negative effect the issue may have on the
organization.
1.9.4. The Team. As a leader, give clear guidance, establish solid processes, and create a
culture that is positive and encouraging. Be loyal and build synergy. See Figure 1.3, A
“Normal” 6-month Rotation.
Figure 1.3. A “Normal” 6-month Rotation
1.10. Beyond the Tour. Look for better ways and long-term fixes. Do not hide from mistakes.
Owning mistakes is difficult to accept but own them, correct them, and try not to repeat them. Do
not avoid problems and do not lie. Dishonesty detracts from the Air Force core values and
minimizes the reputation of a leader.
1.10.1. Do Not Be a Firefighter. Find long-term solutions to recurrent problems and deal
with the root of the problem. Avoid the quick fix and put the time and energy into finding a
permanent solution.
1.10.2. Build Relationships. Fostering positive working conditions with subordinates,
peers/counterparts, chain of command, and higher headquarters staff.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
1-15
 
 
1.10.3. Be Visible. Get out from behind the desk and visit with the team. The team needs to
see their leader actively engaged in leading the team.
1.10.4. Give and Get Feedback. Feedback should be constructive, relevant, and timely. It
should be done with the intent to help the individual grow and perform better. Do not make it
about the person but the actions. Take advantage of the individual meetings with supervisors
to ask for feedback on meeting goals, managing people, and response to stress and conflict. A
leader should be open to advice and be seen acting on it. Ask peers for their feedback as well.
1.10.5. Accountability. Leaders should maintain the right level of oversight and know when
to get involved to resolve situations.

READINESS AND PLANS
2.1. Purpose. Readiness and Plans members operate in a contingency environment as prime
readiness in base services (RIBS) members that may be prepared to deploy to support mission
requirements that span the globe. This informational in-the-field reference resource provides
Prime RIBS members the information to make independent decisions based on proven tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTP) for establishing and maintaining readiness and plans
management and oversight.
2.2. Phases of Operation. Phases of an operation are distinct in time, space, and purpose from
one another and also represent a natural progression and subdivision of the campaign or operation.
Each phase of operation has a set of starting and ending conditions and should be condition-driven
rather than time-driven. See Figure 2.1, Phases of an Operation.
Figure 2.1. Phases of an Operation
2.3. Readiness. Ancillary training, career field requirements, home station readiness training
(HRST), and SILVER FLAG exercise site training are coordinated to execute agile combat
support (ACS) across the full spectrum of military operations. This process is designed to meet
Air Force Force Generation (AFFORGEN) execution requirements. The force support force
element defines the initial UTCs/capabilities required to stand-up a bare base under the AETF
construct. It also represents the movement of functional capability from Establish the Airbase,
Operate the Airbase, and Robust the Airbase into sustainment. A copy of the 2.1 Force Support
force element and UTCs and a 2.2 UTC Placemat can be accessed by clicking on the paperclip

2.4. Open the Airbase. The objective of this element is to employ those capabilities required to
open an airbase. Airbase opening is accomplished by inserting combat and combat support forces
into an operating location capable of conducting tasks required for the effective stand-up of initial
airfield operations and the reception of follow-on forces. The element provides capabilities
specific to the conduct of airfield operations, C2, airfield survey, and air traffic control.
2.4.1. C2 Force Element. The C2 force element provides the permanent C2 capability
through the establishment of the air and space expeditionary wing or group structure. This
capability assumes control of the operating location from the Open the Airbase element to C2
capability within hours of arrival. The initial Services management team arrives as part of the
C2 element. Top priorities include planning the Services portion of the beddown operation to
ensure activities are sited properly to support the projected population.
2.5. Establish the Airbase. The Establish the Airbase element contains capabilities designed to
integrate and extend capabilities of the C2 element and replace the open the airbase capabilities.
Included are capabilities designed to support most missions or weapons systems. This is the
largest AETF force element and contains the required functional capabilities to bring the beddown
to initial operational capability (IOC), ready to receive the main mission or weapon system.
During the first seven to ten days of this force element, Services lodges the force, establishes
dining facilities, transitions from meals, ready-to-eat (MRE) to heat and serve unitized group
rations (UGR), ensures a mortuary affairs capability, and begins initial laundry support through
self-help laundries from WRM or local contract.
2.6. Generate the Mission. The generate the mission force element is effects-based and
capability-dependent. The mission platforms that make up the generate the mission element (e.g.,
fighter, bomber, tanker, airlift) are capable of deployment upon minimal strategic warning, and
typically begin to arrive on or about C+2 and are capable of mission-generation within 36 hours
upon arrival. This element also contains mission systems, operators, maintenance, munitions,
petroleum oils and lubricants (POL) operations, and medical support.
2.7. Operate the Airbase. The Operate the Airbase force element is required for permanent C2
and mission support capability. It expands the infrastructure by enhancing medical capability,
including rapid evacuation of patients, providing mobility weapons storage, enhancing fuels
storage and distribution, and has refueling and defueling capability. It contains mission support
forces needed to achieve full operating capability (FOC) and to make the initial operating
capabilities of the airbase mature and robust. In this element, Services expands life sustaining
programs and introduces quality of life (QoL) activities such as recreation, fitness,
nonappropriated fund (NAF) resale, and Army Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) support.
The initial stages of this force element are used to plan for sustained operations to include
transition to semi-permanent facilities.
2.8. Robust the Airbase. The Robust the Airbase force element contains those support forces
that would typically not arrive until 30 days after an operating location is established. This
element provides additional combat support forces to robust the capabilities already in place from
the previous force elements, to include establishing learning resource center (LRC) operations,
until a rotational operation can be implemented. The Robust the Airbase force element is
considered part of the baseline structure for the AETF. See Figure 2.3, Force Elements.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Figure 2.3. Force Elements
2.9. War Reserve Materiel (WRM). To meet the lighter and leaner AFFORGEN philosophy,
legacy WRM assets (e.g., Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon) have been upgraded for
deployability and functionality. To keep up with the various changes to deployable assets, the
overall program for managing and updating bare base assets were placed under the basic
expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) WRM program. BEAR is part of an overall Air Force
strategic effort to shift from a threat-based force to a capabilities-based force. The
capabilities-based model focuses more on configuring forces and materiel into packages that are
flexible enough to support the full spectrum of military operations, not just major theater war.
BEAR meets Air Force requirements for a light and lean capability to support its AFFORGEN
force elements. BEAR sets also reflect lessons learned from recent expeditionary operations
during which housekeeping and utilities packages deployed and required significant tailoring to
meet mission needs. BEAR sets are right-sized and have a variety of playbook options. See
Chapter 5, Contingency Feeding Operations for more information.
2.10. Population. The determinant factor for Services to begin supporting Airmen is the
population number. Consumption rates, cycle times, planning, and material requirements are
based on the number of Airmen being supported. Services UTCs change as technology and world
situations dictate but are designed to provide critical and non-critical positions that give specific
effects to a certain population number. These UTCs are placed together at a beddown location in
sufficient number to provide complete Services support (e.g., C2, food, lodging, mortuary) to the
AFFORGEN force elements.
2.10.1. Boots-on-Ground (BOG). The 2.3 BOG Example can be accessed by clicking on the
paperclip icon on the left-hand side of this PDF.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
2-5
 
 
2.10.2. Population Summary (POPSUM). POPSUM is the total number of forces on the
ground that require support from the base operating support-integrator and provider
(BOS-I/BOS-P). The population supported drives the EFSS forces, facilities, and equipment
required (UTC). For example, if the population to be supported is 550, using the planning
factor of 1 x 3F1 per every 50 people, feeding operations would require 11 x 3F1s.
2.10.3. Determining Requirements. Requirements for a particular contingency, exercise, or
deployment are consolidated into a single document known as the deployment requirements
manning document (DRMD). This document provides MAJCOMs, numbered air forces
(NAF), and wings with the personnel requirements for fulfilling their exercise, deployment,
and contingency needs.
2.10.3.1. The deployment manning requirements (DMR) is the space to the personnel face
that is generated to complete a DRMD. DMRs are transmitted to the base from the
supported component command through the MAJCOM functional area manager (FAM).
2.10.3.2. FAMs ensure installation deployment readiness cells (IDRC) and installation
personnel readiness (IPR) elements are informed of wing AFFORGEN sourcing using the
DCAPES system. In the wing, the IPR is assigned responsibility for the AFFORGEN
sourcing and verification process. This process may vary from base to base, but the
DRMD is required by the Installation Deployment Control Center at the military personnel
flight. Every contingency, deployment, or exercise tasking that is built, created, and flowed
contains this necessary information and other data elements relevant to the process.
2.10.4. Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). There are two major types of
TPFDDs-requirements and capabilities driven. See Figure 2.4 TPFDD Explained.
2.10.4.1. The requirements-driven TPFDDs are associated with written operation plans
(OPLAN), concept plans (CONPLAN), and operation orders (OPORD). This type
contains the Air Force presentation of forces in support of a specific requirements-driven
plan. Air Force planners support the requirements-driven TPFDDs by building, sourcing,
verifying, and validating unit line numbers (ULN) to the component headquarters and the
supporting or supported combatant command. Examples of requirements-driven TPFDDs
include, but are not limited to contingency planning TPFDDs as required by the Joint
Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) or other defense planning document. Crisis action
planning TPFDDs include, but are not limited to, imminent/on-going combat operations,
humanitarian relief operations (HUMRO), noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO),
and rotational operations.
2.10.4.2. The capabilities-driven TPFDD is used to assess methods for organizing,
training, equipping, and sustaining air and space forces to meet defense strategy
requirements. The capabilities-driven TPFDDs are normally those that depict an Air Force
capability not directly associated with a specific requirement. This TPFDD shows a
capability representing the Air Force commitment to respond, fulfilling war-fighting and
operational requirements. Unlike requirements-driven TPFDDs, capabilities-driven
TPFDDs are normally service owned. Air Force planners at all levels support
capabilities-driven TPFDDs by building and sourcing ULNs to ensure support to a
potential operational requirement or assess overall operational and population driven Air
Force capabilities. Examples of capabilities-driven TPFDDs include AFFORGEN force

element and operational capability packages (OCP). Libraries base level assessment
(BLA) including Air Force-specific exercise TPFDDs used to support war games and/or
studies in support of strategic analyses.
NOTE: Critical for TPFDD management is the accuracy and timeliness associated with the data
elements.
Figure 2.4. TPFDD Explained
2.11. Planning Factors. The ACS concept of operations (CONOPS) assumes that once access
conditions are established through global strike and global persistent attack, there will be a need
for persistent and sustained operations if war-winning effects are not initially achieved. ACS also
assumes that sustainment begins on day one and may remain continuous from deployment,
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
2-7
 
 
through employment and redeployment to mitigate the need for operational pauses. Within the
initial AETF force elements (open the base, C2, establish the base), expeditionary forces may
possess a certain level of self-sustainment. Optimal execution of ACS depends on integrated
planning and execution. Each C-NAF should be fully networked with sister component planning
and execution centers, facilitating an assured, integrated common operating picture and
availability of decision-quality information. See Attachment 2, Planning Factors. See Table 2.1,
Readiness Planning Considerations.
Table 2.1. Readiness Planning Considerations
2.12. Command and Control. UCCs provide mission support to the incident commander and to
the installation control center as directed by the emergency operations center (EOC). The EOC
and installation control center resolve any conflicting requirements. UCCs provide a focal point
within an organization to maintain unit C2 and relay information to and from unit personnel. They
also provide expertise to the EOC or incident commander, and leverage unit resources to respond
to and mitigate the threat. The EFSS commander assigns highly knowledgeable and capable
personnel to the UCC to facilitate mission accomplishment. See Table 1.2, Status Board Example.
2.12.1. Recall Rosters. Recall rosters are used for contacting members in the organization to
either recall or notify of important situations. There are 7 options of recall.
• Option 1 Unit Recall.
• Option 2 Telephone Recall.
• Option 3 Telephone Standby.
• Option 4 Information Only Recall.
• Option 5 Weather Alert.
• Option 6 School Delay/Cancellation.
• Option 7 Communication Outage Recall.
2.12.1.1. Recall Process. Recalls will begin with the UCC notifying each group
commander. Commanders will begin to notify personnel listed on their recall roster
(information flowing from top to bottom).
• Location type and local conditions 
• Reception and beddown of forces (both initial and projected inbound) by expected date
• Types and numbers of resources (manpower, facilities, assets) immediately available and
projected 
• Where to site war reserve materiel (WRM) structures
• Laundry, meals, and contingency quarters options for pre-tent city build up
• Identify vendors through Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
• Mortuary affairs operations 
• Determine reception, staging, onward movement & integration (RSO&I) for inbound
deployers 
• Identify accountability procedures for personnel support for contingency operations
(PERSCO) team

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
2.12.1.2. Write the message down to pass along the recall message. Call the next person(s)
below on the roster and pass along the recall message. If the person below cannot be
contacted, call the next person(s) below that person and pass the message to them. Be sure
to pass along the names of anyone who was not contacted so they will be noted at the
bottom of the recall flow.
2.12.1.3. One person, either the commander or an appointed recall POC from the unit will
call the results into the UCC and pass along the names of all members not notified.
2.12.1.4. Appointed recall POC continues to attempt contact with the unaccounted and
report results through the same process every hour until 100 percent accountability is
attained.
2.13. Plans. The base expeditionary support plan (ESP) is developed in two parts. Part one
identifies resources and capabilities of a location by functional area and is the focus of the
expeditionary site survey. Part two allocates resources identified in part one, assesses the ability to
support the operation, and identifies limiting factors (LIMFAC).
2.13.1. Theater Planner. Theater planners and expeditionary forces coordinate for all facets
of operations spanning all force elements. Items requiring coordination include:
• Planned forces, facilities, equipment.
• Sources of contracts, host nation agreements.
• Expected mission and duration of operations.
• Commercially available sources.
• Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) food pipelines and prime vendor support.
• Exchange (AAFES) concept of support.
• Establishment of a Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) and NAF resale
operations.
• SITREPs and upward channel reporting requirements.
• After action reports.
• Theater-specific reporting and requirements.
• DOD activity address code (DoDAAC) establishment and use.
• General orders.
• Rules of engagement (ROE)/standard operating procedures (SOP).

Chapter 3
CH3 RECEPTION
RECEPTION
3.1. Initial Deployment. Deployment planning is a rigorous process of checking and
crosschecking plans against available information and resources. Reception, beddown, and
accountability should be accomplished right the first time. To do this, the initial Lead wing and
other core support units should obtain all available deployment information and consider
applicable planning factors.
3.1.1. Planning Assumptions. The ACS CONOPS assumes that once access conditions are
established through global strike and global persistent attack, there may be a need for
persistent and sustained operations if war-winning effects are not initially achieved. ACS
assumes that sustainment begins on day one and should remain continuous from deployment,
through employment and redeployment to mitigate the need for operational pauses. Within the
initial AETF force elements (i.e., open the base, C2, establish the base), expeditionary forces
possess a level of self-sustainment. Optimal execution of ACS depends on integrated planning
and execution. Each C-NAF may be fully networked with its sister components’ planning and
execution centers, facilitating an assured, integrated common operating picture and ensuring
the availability of decision quality information.
3.1.2. Worldwide. Operational commanders may accept a reduced level of service from the
day full mobilization commences (M-day) through M+30 to only what is needed to ensure
mission accomplishment and life support. After M+30, levels of service may be increased
commensurate with QoL programs when possible. This normally is determined after the
six-month milestone of a deployment. EFSS and air expeditionary wing (AEW) commanders
can often determine even earlier than six months whether the location is to be used for a longer
period.
3.1.2.1. If the base will be a long-term location, sustainment efforts usually involve
obtaining more permanent supporting structures and utilities, using contracts to augment
or replace some support services, and replacing WRM equipment with commercial
equipment.
3.1.2.2. Each branch of the armed forces follow when establishing planning factors for
replacement of shelters, including those that force support uses.
3.1.2.3. Even though there are limits within the doctrine, there are no hard and fast
requirements that prevent a theater from improving contingency mission capabilities
within established mission budgets and priorities.
3.1.2.4. It is important to work with the component command’s force support organization
when making decisions. They have the long-range vision and responsibility for their
theater. If a base will be designated as a prime mission support location for more than 24
months, force support and civil engineering (CE) planners usually try to obtain equipment
and shelters (e.g., hard-wall or constructed facilities) to replace WRM assets. Refer to AFI
25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM).
3.2. PERSCO. PERSCO is the collection of manual and automated procedures, systems,
hardware, personnel agencies, and deployable individuals or teams to accomplish total force
accountability and reporting, casualty reporting, and personnel program advice. PERSCO in
 
 
3-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
conjunction with EFSS should establish initial beddown and reception processes. A review of
component site specific reporting instructions and CONOPS are evaluated to determine the
required courses of action to effectively receive deploying forces.
3.2.1. Reception Roles and Responsibilities. PERSCO has numerous layers of direction
when establishing reception processing. Air Force (AF)/A1XO is responsible in defining the
PERSCO initial beddown process and guidance for general force support processes. Air Force
Personnel Center (AFPC)/DP2W assists AF/A1XO in developing total force concepts,
policies, and plans to support PERSCO during all aspects of reception processing. The
component A1 should establish deployment processing reception policy and determine the
scope of reception processing and PERSCO site set up. The PERSCO team chief should work
with component A1 to determine UTC requirements needed for reception processing.
3.2.2. UTC Management for PERSCO Reception. The component command personnel
planner determines the PERSCO team requirements at each location based on a variety of
factors. Teams employed at an existing Air Force installation or at a bare base location may
require different lead UTCs based on initial reception of personnel and site infrastructure. An
existing EFSS may require augmentation to properly support the reception of projected
employed forces compared to a full PERSCO team stand-up.
3.2.2.1. The component command personnel planner may want to increase PERSCO
support for bare base and forward operating locations (FOL). This increase is especially
needed in the deployment phase of operations when it is generally more difficult to locate
and account for personnel, coordinate management actions, and provide for personnel
matters.
3.2.2.2. PERSCO CONOPS should identify the PERSCO supply packages and the
communications support needed by the PERSCO team, the FOL, and the relationships that
the FOLs have with each other. It should also specify known reception points and
procedures. Determination of direct chain of command should be established with
PERSCO CONOPS. PERSCO Teams should work with component command and
deployed commander to determine scope of operations required during site set up.
3.2.2.3. Site Infrastructure. Although not directly affecting the number of PERSCO team
members, permanent structures, services, and communications support may affect the
amount of support equipment needed to operate effectively. The component command
personnel planner coordinates with logistics planners in accordance with AFI 10-404,
Base Support and Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning, to determine what facilities,
equipment, and supplies are readily available at each employment location identified in the
TPFDD. At a minimum, the personnel planner coordinates with the following agencies to
identify PERSCO infrastructure requirements:
3.2.2.3.1. Logistics and security forces planners for facility, equipment, and supply
requirements.
3.2.2.3.2. Civil engineer planners for electric power requirements. The component
command provides electrical transformers to meet unclassified and classified systems
power requirements to convert from 220 volts to 110 volts where applicable.
3.2.2.3.3. Communication planners for communications requirements for all locations
in the area of responsibility (AOR) capable of supporting wartime and contingency

operations. Communication support includes identifying the need for secure and
non-secure telephone/data fax, SIPRNET, and NIPRNET capability.
3.2.2.4. Judgment of the personnel planner is a key element in establishing a PERSCO
team tasking and its ultimate size. When tasked, the PERSCO team provides strength
accountability for and support to geographically separated units (GSU). There is not a
direct relationship between the size of the force and the PERSCO support needed.
PERSCO Teams supporting a large GSU population may need personnel to support their
accountability activities.
3.2.2.4.1. The formula of one personnel technician per 275 individuals is used as only
a guide and can be adjusted (increase or decrease) based on the assigned PERSCO
mission requirements.
3.2.2.4.2. Factors taken into account include: working a 60-hour workweek per AFI
38-101, Manpower and Organization, location at an aerial port of debarkation
(APOD), supporting GSUs, threat level, deployment phase, incoming personnel surge
level, joint population serviced, strength ceilings, supporting main operation base
(MOB) versus FOL, CNAF-unique reporting requirements, joint reporting
requirements, and other available support at a deployed location should be taken into
account.
3.2.3. Pre-Deployment Actions. Upon notification of deployment, the PERSCO team chief
should review the pre-deployment checklist to identify the necessary personnel planning
actions to prepare the team for deployment and reception processing. Determination of scope
of pre-deployment actions will be based on whether the deployment is to augment IPR or bare
base operations. The PERSCO CONOPS assists in the development of the PERSCO
deployment plan.
3.2.3.1. Completion of the predeployment actions should be done prior to the execution
phase. Some actions from predeployment operations can be accomplished during
execution phase if CONOPS and general site infrastructure information is unavailable.
3.2.3.2. Advanced Coordination. If not part of the advanced echelon (ADVON), the
PERSCO team should coordinate with on-site personnel upon arrival to establish location
of PERSCO and reception control center (RCC) if not already established. The PERSCO
team chief should meet with the installation deployment officer (IDO) or appointed
logistics readiness officer (LRO) to establish reception processing roles and
responsibilities. The RCC should be within close proximity of all controlled ports of
embarkation. RCCs not within close proximity should maintain contact with logistics
readiness and units with dedicated modes of transportations. PERSCO Teams should
coordinate with the appropriate agencies to ensure accountability is obtained if personnel
have already arrived. Personnel already on site may be required to complete reception
processing.
3.2.3.3. Systems. Prior to arrival of a PERSCO team, the deployed commander is
responsible for capturing arrival information regardless of the mode of travel. Consider all
potential avenues a person may arrive (e.g., commercial air, privately owned vehicle
[POV], rail) to determine how to account for them. If directed, PERSCO Teams can obtain
the status of en route individuals traveling on dedicated airlift through the transportation

office using the Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) or the Global
Transportation Network (GTN). Transportation systems provide the capability to track
individuals by name, social security number, and ULN from the time they depart from
home station until arrival at the final destination. These systems can also provide the status
of aircraft delays or layovers that may assist the PERSCO team in the overall
accountability effort.
3.2.3.4. Schedules. The PERSCO team chief should develop tentative shift schedules and
assign specific duties and responsibilities to each deploying PERSCO team member based
on most current information available. Discuss with each deploying PERSCO team
member the tentative work schedules, expected duties, and initial arrival actions. Review
the required actions needed to be accomplished upon arrival to ensure everyone
understands what to do and how to accomplish their actions.
3.2.4. Initial Set-up Actions. The PERSCO team should have a copy and be familiar with
AOR unique guidance regarding personnel policies and procedures. These instructions should
be used to answer questions and concerns of commanders and the population in general. Issues
not addressed in the AOR instructions should be elevated to the component command for
action. See Table 3.1, PERSCO Team Initial Arrival Checklist and Table 3.2, PERSCO
Recommended Equipment and Supply Table.

NOTES:
1. Any sub-item checked as NO is a LIMFAC. Report this to major command (MAJCOM), the 
component command, and courtesy copy Headquarters (HQ) United States Air Force 
(USAF)/A1PR/MPRC and HQ AFPC/DP2W/OSC. Follow up to ensure the parent MAJCOM 
and the component command act to correct the LIMFAC. If information is classified, contact 
the parent MAJCOM and the component command for correct reporting procedures.
2. Take into consideration the status-of-forces agreements (SOFA) and customs of the host 
country. The security forces are able to answer these types of questions. Take into consideration 
operations plan (OPLAN) or tasking requirements when coordinating with support agencies. 
Identify all choke points to capture accountability of personnel (e.g., billeting, entry/exit gates, 
and recreational facilities).
3. This includes constant coordination with supporting medical and mortuary counterparts to 
ensure notification of casualties.
4. Documenting problems, achievements, or milestones establishes the foundation for inputs to 
the AAR.
5. The responsibility for accounting for GSUs is identified by the tasking message or by the 
component command’s concept of operations (CONOPS). GSU accountability procedures may 
include a GSU representative faxing copies of orders/AF Forms 245, Employment Locator 
Checklist and Processing calling, or e-mailing duty status changes to the supporting PERSCO 
team.
6. When establishing procedures, all accountability responsibilities of the PERSCO team
outlined by the component command should be taken into consideration. The term Total Force
consists of Air Force active duty, Air Reserve Components (ARC), Department of the Air Force
(DAF) civilians, contractors supporting the Air Force mission, and other civilian personnel not
employed by the Department of Defense (DOD) who support the Air Force mission (e.g., Red
Cross, United Service Organizations [USO], consultants) as well as the in-place force supporting
contingency operations. Total Force accountability can be expanded by the combatant
commander or the component command to include other DOD civilians, other DOD-essential
contractor personnel, other Services, Allied Forces, coalition forces and/or other personnel.

3.3. RCC. Upon notification of deployment, the PERSCO team chief should engage with the
supported component command A1 to establish procedures for reception control. Once the
PERSCO team has arrived at deployed location, they should establish a controlled point of entry
to receive deploying personnel.
3.3.1. RCC Minimum Requirements. The RCC should have briefing capabilities to include:
3.3.1.1. NIPRNET and SIPRNET briefings.
3.3.1.2. Power supply.
3.3.1.3. Secure and non-secure telephone.
3.3.1.4. NIPRNET and SIPRNET capability.
3.3.1.5. Classified operating environment.
3.3.1.6. POC listing for AFPC, Headquarters Air Force (HAF), component A1, units to
include GSU and tenant unit
3.3.1.7. Secure and non-secure e-mail accounts.
3.3.1.8. Standard supply items (e.g., pens, pencils, printer paper).
3.3.1.9. Chairs and tables as needed.
3.3.1.10. Computer and projector capabilities as necessary.
3.3.2. Additional Resources for RCC. The RCC may need partner personnel required to
in-process members upon initial arrival at deployed location. Additional resources needed and
determination of reception policy and guidelines should be established by PERSCO team
chief, component A1, and deployed CONOPS. Available additional resources include:
3.3.2.1. Force support squadron (FSS) contingency quarters personnel—assign
contingency quarters.
3.3.2.2. Medical squadron—briefing on medical readiness precautions.
3.3.2.3. Security forces squadron—brief on force protection levels.
3.3.2.4. Chaplains—brief on available resources.
3.3.2.5. Logistics squadron—equipment distribution as required.
3.3.2.6. FSS food/feeding operations—distribution of MREs or brief on available
services.
3.3.3. Reception Processing Procedures. The PERSCO team chief upon notification of
arriving personnel should coordinate with base resources established as mandatory initial
arrival reception personnel to setup RCC. PERSCO team chief should contact the Logistics
Readiness Officer/noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) first. RCC dedicated dates
and times can be established based on transportation schedule. RCC can function as a
PERSCO centric processing action without additional resources.
3.3.3.1. RCC optional personnel report as directed.
3.3.3.2. PERSCO direct all arriving personnel to provide the following items upon arrival
at point of embarkation (POE):
 
 
3-10
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
• Contingency, exercise, and deployment (CED) orders or DD Form 1610, Request
and Authorization for TDY Travel of DOD Personnel (Activation Order for Title 10,
United States Code [USC] mobilization or Annual Training).
• AF Form 245, Employment Locator Card Checklist and Processing.
• Common access card (CAC).
• PERSCO in-processing checklist (established upon arrival).
3.3.3.3. PERSCO team should annotate arrival date, unit of assignment, lodging
arrangements, blood type, and religious preference on AF Form 245.
3.3.3.4. PERSCO team should annotate any in-processing discrepancies for input into
Deployment Personnel Discrepancy Reporting Tool (DPDRT). Discrepancies can include
early or late arrival, missing mandatory items, and/or missing equipment.
3.3.3.5. PERSCO team should make appropriate updates to electronic deployment
readiness checklist (EDRC) validating arrival and receipt of deployment documents.
3.3.3.6. Upon completion of RCC required items, deployed personnel should be released
to unit of assignment for continued processing.
3.3.3.7. PERSCO should complete mandatory DCAPES updates and finalize manual file
processing.
3.4. Accountability. Personnel accountability is defined as the accurate accounting for all Air
Force personnel at all times regardless of location. Accountability can be expanded by the
combatant commander or the component command to include other DOD civilians, other
DOD-essential contractor personnel, other Services, allied forces, coalition forces, and other
personnel. Commanders at all levels are ultimately responsible for maintaining accountability of
their forces. PERSCO is a tool to assist commanders in obtaining and maintaining accountability.
Commanders should establish procedures to account for their forces when there is no PERSCO at
the deployed location.
3.4.1. Personnel CONOPS. This enables planners and managers to support the commander’s
CONOPS by providing strength and casualty information essential for the commander to
make informed decisions concerning force allocation and capabilities. At the unified
command level and above, this information also assists senior leaders in making informed
decisions. Personnel CONOPS lays out the force accountability responsibilities, command
relationships, strength reporting procedures, reporting instructions and known FOL PERSCO
resources in a theater of operations.
3.4.1.1. The personnel CONOPS is a living document critical to total force accountability
operations and may require revisions as a contingency or war evolves.
3.4.1.2. The component command personnel war planners are the office of primary
responsibility (OPR) for the personnel CONOPS. Personnel war planners at all echelons
should understand the personnel CONOPS functionality and the importance of accurate
contingency and execution planning for CONOPS development.
3.4.1.3. General planning guidance for personnel war planners can be found in the War
Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 1, and Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI)
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
3-11
 
 
10-401, Operations Planning and Execution. These documents should be reviewed before
planning for any contingency operation or exercise.
3.4.2. Accounting for Deployed and Residual Forces. This provides senior military and
civilian leadership visibility of the human resources committed to contingency operations.
3.4.3. Force Accountability. The PERSCO team should maintain accountability of deployed
personnel using DCAPES. The Employment Requirements Manning Document lists the
requirements for a particular deployed location. PERSCO monitors all requirements and
coordinates with deployed commanders and servicing manpower office to determine if
requirements are valid.
3.4.4. Historical Capture of Personnel Accountability Data. This is provided by
AFPC/Directorate of Personnel Operations (DP2) on a regular basis to the chain of command
(who was deployed where and for how long). This allows the tracking and analysis of
personnel and their association to specific military operations for future programs and
initiatives (e.g., Gulf War Syndrome, follow-up treatment, medical counseling, state bonuses
and entitlements).
3.4.5. Roles and Responsibilities. Accountability is critical to Air Force readiness. Accurate
and timely accountability is key in determining mission ready forces in crisis situations.
3.4.5.1. AF/A1XO has overall responsibility of Air Force personnel readiness and
accountability programs. AF/A1XO develops concepts and policies to ensure Total Force
accountability.
3.4.5.2. AFPC/DP2W ensures total force accountability is maintained for all Air Force
personnel supporting contingency, wartime, exercise, and emergency operations. Monitors
when PERSCO Teams are established at new locations during contingency or wartime
operations. Works with component commands to ensure PERSCO Teams obtain
SIPRNET connectivity to DCAPES. Ensures PERSCO members submit deployed
DCAPES account access requests. Works with component commands and deployed
PERSCO Teams to correct accountability data.
3.4.5.3. MAJCOM Directorates of Manpower, Personnel, and Services (MAJCOM/A1)
maintains accountability of personnel assigned to the command.
3.4.5.4. Supported component command (contingency and exercise support) Director of
Manpower, Personnel, and Services Personnel/A1 maintains Total Force accountability by
tracking and managing deployed personnel data for their AOR by using DCAPES systems.
3.4.5.5. Deployed unit commander in the absence of a PERSCO team or mission planning
element (MPE) establishes procedures to account for deployed unit personnel as required
by the supported C-NAF personnel planner. Oversees all personnel accountability and
reporting requirements of component command contingency and exercise support
personnel function. Reports duty status and casualty information (e.g., arrivals, departures,
hospitalizations, deaths, duty status whereabouts unknown [DUSTWUN]).
3.4.5.6. PERSCO team chief and DCAPES operators are responsible for Total Force
accountability accomplished systems utilizing DCAPES. This software uses a series of
business rules to alert users to changes in deployment requirements and the status of
deployed persons.
 
 
3-12
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
3.4.6. Types of Accountability. There is not one type of accountability. PERSCO Teams are
responsible for personnel in all capacities of their deployment. PERSCO should maintain
accountability from boots on ground until member is gained by home station upon completion
of deployment. Types of accountability are listed below.
3.4.6.1. Strength Accountability. In accordance with component command policies,
PERSCO Teams should maintain accountability for all personnel on the ground (to include
transients) at their deployed and designated geographically separated locations regardless
of status. All geographical locations serviced by PERSCO Teams can be located in
DCAPES under personnel functions utilizing the Headquarters Air Force/MAJCOM
routing application.
3.4.6.2. Unit Accountability. The deployed unit commander should maintain
accountability for the unit personnel assigned and/or attached. This accountability includes
knowing where assigned personnel are at any given time, where they live and where they
work.
3.4.6.3. Replacement Accountability. Deployed commanders should initiate replacement
actions in accordance with applicable instructions when necessary to replace a deployed
individual that departs prior to completing the specified tour length. PERSCO Teams
should track the status of all incoming and/or departing personnel as well as their arrival
and departure plans.
3.4.6.4. Transient Accountability. Transient forces are those that spend at least one night
at a location, but their final duty location is elsewhere. PERSCO Teams, in coordination
with contingency quarters and transportation, should track arrival and departure of
transient personnel.
3.4.6.5. Tasked Wing Accountability. Unit commanders and IPR elements should
maintain accountability over their deployed personnel until they have returned to home
station.
3.4.6.6. Total Force accountability is accomplished with DCAPES systems utilizing
DCAPES. This software uses a series of business rules to alert users to changes in
deployment requirements and the status of deployed persons. This software is also
programmed to generate Military Personnel Data System transactions to inform
home-station commanders of the whereabouts and status of their deployed personnel.
3.4.6.6.1. Defining the scope of Total Force accountability is done by Air Force forces
(AFFOR)/A1, C1, or J1. Outlines and expands force accountability procedures to
include non-Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilians, DOD contractor employees
supporting other Services, coalition forces, or others according to the combatant
commander. Maintains personnel accountability by tracking and managing deployed
personnel data for personnel deployed to their AOR. Ensures PERSCO Teams and
EFSS within the theater follow accountability and reporting procedures.
3.4.7. Accountability Procedures. Component CONOPS lays out responsibilities, command
relationships, reporting procedures, and standard operating procedures for PERSCO
pertaining to all AOR operations and plan identification numbers (PID). CONOPS is a living
document and may require revisions as operations evolve. The AFFOR/A1 can be split into
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
3-13
 
 
two components, forward and rear, or can be left combined. If combined, all functions
(forward and rear) listed below should still be accomplished by AFFOR/A1.
3.4.7.1. PERSCO Teams obtain accountability, as defined by supported C-NAF
commander, for all personnel assigned to their location and to designated geographically
separated locations. The only exception may be classified special operations forces (SOF)
that provide their own accountability. Affected PERSCO Teams should be notified by
AFFOR/A1 (Forward). When collocated with SOF, determine reporting requirements with
the deployed Air Force special operations forces (AFSOF)/A1.
3.4.7.2. PERSCO Teams may be responsible for partial accountability for AFSOF forces
assigned to a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG), the SOTG/A1 will provide the daily
joint personnel status (JPERSTAT) to the PERSCO team for DCAPES accountability and
provide information to assist with casualty reporting. Coordination is necessary to prevent
duplication of accountability.
3.4.7.3. Accountability status should be reported daily using a cut-off time of 2400 hours
or a time established by the component command. Report personnel strength to
AFFOR/A1 (Forward) and other required addressees using daily DCAPES duty status
change message.
3.4.7.4. Establish strength accountability for everyone the PERSCO team is responsible
for at all locations and update into accountability system. Obtain accountability of DAF
civilians, essential contractor employees supporting the AF, non-DOD civilians, other
United States (US) Services (Army, Navy, Marine Corps), or coalition forces personnel if
directed by the supported C-NAF commander. Strength accountability provides valuable
planning and decision-making information to senior leaders at all levels concerning
deployed force closure, force sustainment, and force availability.
3.4.7.5. RCC should aide in completing accountability requirements. PERSCO team
members should collect at least one copy of the CED orders annotated with the date
arrived and a completed AF Form 245 to establish manual files as back up to SIPRNET
DCAPES system.
3.4.7.6. The PERSCO team chief should identify a POC for all units (to include sister
service if directed) at the deployed location and establish procedures for duty status
reporting and accountability maintenance. PERSCO should provide the unit POC with
employment requirement manning documents (ERMD) and alpha rosters of deployed
personnel assigned to their unit weekly. These products should be utilized by the POC to
maintain oversight of assigned individuals as well as projected inbounds. Unit POCs
should report arrivals, departures, and hospitalizations within 24 hours of the change in
duty status.
3.4.7.7. DCAPES Accountability Procedures. PERSCO DCAPES operators should
establish procedures to receive items collected during reception control center processing.
3.4.7.7.1. DCAPES operators should utilize login/password information received
from AFPC/DP2WR Personnel Readiness Operations upon submission of DCAPES
access request form. Form can be found on the DP2WR SharePoint® page located at
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/10666/Personnel_Readiness_Training/SitePages/Home.asp

3.4.7.7.2. DCAPES Arrival Update. Processing thru RCC and visual check of CAC,
CED orders, and AF Form 245, provides sufficient acknowledgment of members’
arrival at deployed location.
3.4.7.7.3. DCAPES PERSCO Web Application Login. Use this menu option to update
arrival of members at locations serviced by the PERSCO team. When updating
arrivals, it is important to set the correct date of arrival. The system defaults to today’s
date, but if the members arrived on a past date, type in or select that date from the
calendar box. Also ensure to arrive the member to the appropriate geographic location
(GEOLOC) (defaults to Rqmt GEO) if they are located at a GEOLOC serviced by the
PERSCO team. This function may be used on single or multiple records. Step by Step
guidance can be found at AFPC/DP2WR SharePoint® in the Wing Level Users Guide
(WLUG)
https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/10666/Personnel_Readiness_Training/SitePages/Home.aspx
3.4.7.8. Duty Status Change Message. At the end of each day a daily tally of duty status
changes should be accomplished. This function generates a report used to create the daily

Chapter 4
CH4 CONTINGENCY QUARTERS
CONTINGENCY QUARTERS
4.1. Introduction. This chapter provides Prime RIBS members with information to make
independent decisions based on proven TTP for establishing and maintaining contingency
quarters and laundry operations.
4.2. Definition. Contingency quarters are defined as the operations and facilities necessary to
beddown forces deployed to and transiting an operating location in support of an exercise or
contingency location.
4.3. Capabilities. Prime RIBS capabilities include both forces and equipment. These forces and
equipment are packaged into UTCs designed to support specific populations in increments of
either 275 or 550 personnel. Therefore, it is critical to have accurate information on the population
to be supported. If not, operations may be without necessary resources.
4.4. Planning. Prime RIBS members and EFSS leadership are tasked with developing plans to
best use available resources to achieve mission success. To do so, the anticipated size and mission
of the population is needed. Gather deployment information from the Theater Service Planner and
then obtain all available local and applicable planning factors to right-size the plan to the mission.
4.5. Locations. Prime RIBS teams deploy to and support contingency requirements globally. A
contingency location (CL) is a non-enduring location outside of the United States that supports
and sustains operations during contingencies or other operations. See Table 4.1 Location Types
for a description of the wide range of locations.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Table 4.1. Location Types
4.6. Deployment Phases. The deployment phases are aligned to (but not the same as) force
elements and help identify both the status of the base from an operational standpoint and the
expected resources Prime RIBS members should have available. See Table 4.2, Deployment
Phases.
Type of Base
Description
Initial Contingency Location 
(CL)
Missions that are expected to last up to 9 months. A locale 
occupied by a force in immediate response to a contingency 
operation and characterized by austere infrastructure and 
limited services with little or no external support except through 
Service-organic capabilities.
Temporary CL 
Missions that are expected to last up to 24 months. A locale that 
provides near-term support for a contingency operation and 
characterized by expedient infrastructure and support services 
that have been expanded beyond Service-organic capabilities. 
Semipermanent CL
Missions that are expected to last from 24 to 60 months. A 
contingency location that provides support for a prolonged 
contingency operation and characterized by enhanced 
infrastructure and support services consistent with sustained 
operations. 
Main Operating Base (MOB)
A facility outside of the United States and its territories with 
permanently stationed operating forces and robust 
infrastructure.
Enduring Location (EL)
Typically, locations with missions that exceed 60 months. A 
main operating base, forward operating site, or cooperative 
security location designated by the Department of Defense for 
strategic access and use to support United States security 
interests for the foreseeable future.

Table 4.2. Deployment Phases
4.6.1. Beddown Capacity. The plan to manage contingency quarters should evolve as the
base moves from initial operations to a more sustained environment. Beddown capacity is the
number of bedspaces available to house forces. The more structures and assets available
(shelters and cots), the greater the capacity.
4.6.1.1. The number of bedspaces available when compared to the number of bedspaces
required to beddown everyone determines the capacity. Capacity determines whether there
is a need to either increase or decrease square footage per person. Prime RIBS members
want to generate excess beddown capacity to transition to sustainment. Sustainment
affords greater square feet per person and increases QoL.
4.6.1.2. Plan for 50 square feet per person during initial operations (open the base) and
increase square footage per person when conditions and assets allow.
4.6.1.3. Special mission populations (e.g., distinguished visitors [DV], crew rest, senior
officers) require greater square feet person and are not accounted for in equipment UTCs.
Deployment Phase
Description
Open the Base
Provides the capabilities to open an airbase, regardless of the 
follow-on mission. Open the base forces normally arrive first 
and assess the airbase for establishment of minimum airfield 
operating parameters, command and control, and supporting 
host-nation support capabilities.
Prime readiness in base services (RIBS) should plan for an 
initial contingency location with austere conditions. Limited 
manpower and resources. Shelters and cots are the primary 
contingency quarters resources. If available, maximize use of 
existing facilities.
Operate the Base
Operate the base contains mission support forces needed to 
achieve full operating capability. Forces within this element 
make the initial operating capabilities of the airbase more 
robust with supplies and personnel to sustain forces for a 
minimum of 30 days
Prime RIBS has most of the available manpower and 
resources to operate primarily a tent-based contingency 
quarters operation. Begin developing site-specific standards 
and procedures and begin planning for sustainment 
operations if mission duration permits.
Sustain the Base
Provides additional forces to sustain and robust the 
capabilities already in place from the prior phases.
Prime RIBS begins initiatives to increase quality of life 
(QoL). Sustainment focus areas include bunkbeds, linens, 
wall lockers, support contracts, custodial contracts, and 
transition to semipermanent facilities

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Presence of these populations may decrease the beddown capacity. For example, the
standard contingency quarters UTC provides 12 shelters and cots to support 144 personnel.
To house two General officers, it requires a tent planned to house 12 members. Prime
RIBS members should fully understand the planning factors for specific populations to
generate sufficient beddown capacity.
4.6.1.4. Surge requirements may be implemented allowing for only 40 square feet per
person to increase tent capacity. As more contingency quarters space is obtained or built,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) planning factors should be met or exceeded (minimum of 50
square feet per person). See Table 4.3, Beddown Capacity.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
4-5
 
 
Table 4.3. Beddown Capacity
Beddown Capacity
Description
Open
Use baseline planning factors for square feet and number of 
personnel per tent. A small shelter system (SSS) would beddown 
12 person per tent which provides approximately 55 square feet per 
person.
Prime RIBS primary task is to maximize use of existing facilities 
and tent-based structures to beddown initial deployers. Beddown 
can range from ad hoc (sleep where you can) to managed room/bed 
assignments dependent on manpower and resources based on local 
conditions and directives.
Operate
Coordinate establishment of unit housing representatives to better 
manage bedspace assignments. As the bulk of deploying forces 
arrive, transition to adaptively beddown based on local leadership 
direction (unit based, crew rest) using baseline planning factors for 
square feet and number of personnel per tent. Identify transient and 
rotational requirements and coordinate to have sufficient structures 
erected and assets available.
Sustainment
As additional prime readiness in base services (RIBS) manpower 
and assets become available, develop and implement a plan to 
increase square foot per person. Transition from housing 12 
persons per tent to only 6 to 8 which provides approximately 93 
square feet per person. Mission permitting, begin planning for 
actions to increase quality of life (QoL) (e.g., bunkbeds, linens, 
wall partitions).
Prime readiness in base services (RIBS) should still preserve 
rotational and surge beddown capacity.
Rotational
When forces on the ground are replaced by new deployers. This 
causes an increase in the population to house both the current 
forces and the new forces at the same time. Rotational 
requirements can prompt contingency quarters to enter into surge 
to support beddown requirements. Prime RIBS should have a plan 
and resources to support rotational requirements. Bunkbeds 
increase capacity without requiring additional square footage.
Surge
Demand for bed spaces exceeds current beddown capacity or 
standards. Planning factor is 16 person per SSS, or 40 square feet 
per person. Surge can occur in any phase based on mission 
requirements. Surge can be for a limited timeframe (rotational 
requirements) or may be more permanent due to increased 
population until sufficient capacity and assets can be obtained.

4.7. Contingency Quarters Facilities. Below are the primary types of facilities that Prime RIBS
teams can expect during contingencies. The location type and the deployment phase should drive
available facilities and planning actions. See Table 4.4, Facility Types.
Table 4.4. Facility Types
Types of Facilities
Description
War Reserve Material (WRM)
Tent-based shelter systems. Used primarily for initial 
operations and to support population increases beyond 
the capacity of semi-permanent and permanent facilities. 
Small Shelter System (SSS)
Sleeps 12 persons in open/operate operations, 6 to 8 
persons in sustainment, and 16 persons in surge.
Requires six persons to erect.
Measures 32.5 feet long, by 20 feet wide, by 10 feet high 
(650 square feet), and multiple shelters can be 
interconnected. 
It can withstand steady 50-knot winds and gusts up to 60 
knots. 
Requires at least 35 feet by 50 feet.
Medium Shelter System (MSS)
Sleeps up to 30 persons for rotational operations and 40 
persons in surge. 
Requires six persons to erect. 
Used primarily for transient contingency quarters to 
minimize structures required and maximize available 
space. 
Can be used as a warehouse. 
Measures 52 feet long by 30 feet wide and 15 feet high 
(1,560 square feet). 
It can withstand steady 60-knot winds and gusts up to 90 
knots. 
The site should be at least 40 feet by 60 feet. 
Semi-permanent and Permanent 
Facilities
Non-tent based structures that span from modular 
building (trailers, relocatable buildings, pods, etc.) to 
brick and mortar facilities common to main operating 
bases.
Existing Facilities
Preexisting on-site semi-permanent and permanent 
facilities that may be used for contingency quarters (e.g., 
lodging, dorms, housing, hangars).
Contracted Commercial Quarters
Contracted commercial quarters are quarters obtained 
from commercial hotels or motels to house official duty 
personnel at a reduced rate when all on-site quarters are 
fully occupied.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022

4.8. Planning Considerations. Prime RIBS members are tasked to beddown initial forces while
preparing to receive and house incoming forces. This is often the most difficult planning and
execution phase because Prime RIBS members have limited time and resources to stand-up initial
operations. As previously mentioned, Theater Services Planners and local conditions are the first
and most important sources of information. Some actions listed in paragraph 4.9, Open the Base,
may not be completed until later phases. Actions identified in later phases may be completed
earlier. Once Prime RIBS members have gathered information from all relevant sources, a plan
should be developed that includes the following. See Table 4.5, Planning Considerations.
Table 4.5. Planning Considerations
4.8.1. Location Type and Local Conditions. The contingency location type and local
conditions on the ground shape when and how the contingency quarters plan is developed and
implemented. The duration of operations may be unknown or may change as operations
mature. As a baseline, Prime RIBS members should plan to construct a tent-based operation to
house all personnel. Existing facilities that are made available for contingency quarters should
be treated as bonus space.
4.8.1.1. Prime RIBS members should understand the mission. If the location will be a
transit point or staging location, this creates the need for additional beddown capacity to
house large influxes of inbound and outbound personnel for limited durations.
4.8.1.2. Local conditions may further shape the plan. Is it a permissive or hostile
environment? This may dictate whether the layout is semi-dispersed or dispersed. Is the
area prone to flooding? Is the climate hot, arid, humid, or cold?
4.8.1.3. At some point, additional supplies beyond those provided in UTCs may be
required. Are there local sources to purchase items such as linens, bunkbeds, mattresses,
pillows, cleaning supplies, and wall lockers? Are the items available locally of sufficient
commercial quality to support extensive use?
4.8.1.4. Force Protection. When operating in a chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) environment, the placement of personnel in fixed facilities (e.g., brick,
wood, concrete) promotes force survivability far greater than the placement in soft shelters
(e.g., tent).
4.8.1.5. Prime RIBS members should coordinate with local authorities (i.e., CE and
security forces) to determine the threat condition. The threat condition may shape the
minimum stand-off, tent city configuration, barriers, and bunkers of the beddown
cantonment area.
1. Location type and local conditions (paragraph 4.8.1).
2. Reception and beddown of forces (both initial and projected inbound) by expected date 
(paragraph 4.8.2).
3. Types and numbers of resources (manpower, facilities, assets) immediately available and 
projected (paragraph 4.8.3). 
4. Where to site war reserve material (WRM) structures (paragraph 4.8.4).
 
 
4-8
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
4.8.1.6. Environmental Considerations. Contact CE to have a safety inspection conducted
before occupying any fixed facility. Determine if there are any known environmental
hazards that could restrict operations or require theater logistics, contract, or engineering
support before the facilities or sites are usable. There may be host nation restrictions on use
of certain types of facilities due to location, environmental pollution, loss of service to
existing inhabitants, or other support concerns. For example, environmental problems and
digging restrictions may prevent CE from installing latrines and shower/shave units
without first upgrading sewage systems or tying into existing sewer lines.
4.8.2. Reception and Beddown of Forces. The next step in contingency quarters plan
development is to prepare to receive and beddown forces. Prime RIBS members should work
with local agencies and theater planners to determine the anticipated population to be
supported. See Table 4.4, Facility Types for the capacity of different common shelters.
4.8.3. Types and Number of Resources. Prime RIBS members need to know when they can
expect to receive services forces to support contingency quarters operations. The contingency
location builds in population over time, so be prepared to receive and beddown waves of
deployers.
4.8.3.1. Initial Forces. Prime RIBS members may be part of an ADVON team (the first
group to land) at a contingency location. House initial personnel in existing available
facilities (i.e., contracted commercial quarters, dormitories, K-span®, international
organization for standardization [ISO] container, expandable shelter container [ESC], or
warehouses) when possible until follow-on forces arrive to begin tent city construction. If
none are available, either erect shelters brought with the ADVON team or sleep wherever
possible. Personnel are required to deploy with their sleeping bags.
4.8.3.2. Projected Forces. Prime RIBS members should coordinate with local agencies
(namely expeditionary logistics readiness squadron [ELRS]) and theater planners to
determine population increases (both incremental and final planning numbers). This will
help align WRM construction to anticipated force arrival as well as identify additional
Prime RIBS manpower inbound.
4.8.3.3. Available and Projected Resources. One of the primary tasks of Prime RIBS
members is to maximize the use of limited resources to generate contingency quarters
capacity. Contingency quarters managers need to know what resources are immediately
available on site, those projected to arrive, and those available within the local economy.
4.8.3.4. Contingency Quarters Manpower. Prime RIBS manpower should be provided in
accordance with the applicable UTCs based on the number of personnel being supported.
The initial planning factor for contingency quarters manpower is 2 Prime RIBS members
to support the first 275 personnel and then 1 additional Prime RIBS member for each
population increase of 275 personnel.
4.8.3.5. Contingency quarters area 24-hour operation. Ensure to consider mission and
transient requirements when determining the manning required to support the operation.
Contingency quarters may require more manpower than initial planning factors during
open and operate the base as the cantonment area is being constructed. EFSS leadership
determines how to distribute manpower to support Prime RIBS requirements. It is the task
of contingency quarters managers to inform leadership of their manpower requirements.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
4-9
 
 
4.8.3.6. Facilities and Assets. Selecting facilities to use for contingency quarters is based
on a number of factors which include, but are not limited to, force protection
considerations, type of contingency location, number of personnel deploying to the
location, duration of bed down time, and duration of operations.
4.8.3.7. Assets (equipment and furnishings) to support initial operations may be severely
limited. Prime RIBS should plan to only have WRM assets initially while coordinating
with the local contracting office to determine the availability of assets in the local
economy.
4.8.3.8. Existing Facilities. Fixed facilities are the most desirable accommodations, if
available, and should be used to their fullest extent. Even some austere contingency
locations have existing facilities and utilities that can be used initially for expedient
contingency quarters.
4.8.3.9. War Reserve Material. Prime RIBS should know when to expect the arrival of
WRM structures and then sequence construction to have the beddown capacity to support
the waves of inbound forces. WRM is comprised of BEAR assets (facilities and
equipment) and is the most common type of facility at contingency locations. The
tent-based facilities are known as BEAR shelters.
4.8.3.9.1. Shelter systems are designed to provide for extended erection of 10 years
with a shelf life of 20 years. The small shelter system can be set up by a trained crew of
6 personnel in 9-man hours and the medium shelter system can be set up by a trained
crew of 6 in 24-man hours. Each shelter comes with a transportable container that can
be moved with a forklift. See Table 4.6, Shelter Systems.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Table 4.6. Shelter Systems
4.8.3.9.2. BEAR Housekeeping Sets. BEAR structures and equipment are packaged
together with a variety of shelter systems and other key components (e.g., lighting
systems, basic water and electrical systems, latrines, and showers). to support and
maintain a contingency location. Instead of requesting 12 small shelter system (SSS)
shelters and associated cots individually, BEAR packages combine assets to deliver
specific capabilities.
4.8.3.9.3. BEAR 150 Housekeeping Set. The BEAR 150 Housekeeping Set, also
known as Swift BEAR or B150 (UTC XFB1A), is a stand-alone package that supports
a maximum of 150 personnel for approximately 5 days. It provides austere shelter (12
persons per tent, cots, and environmental control), basic hygiene, low voltage electrical
generation and distribution, and forklift support. The set weighs 44 tons and requires
17.5 pallet positions (one C-17) to airlift.

4.8.3.9.4. BEAR 550 Initial Housekeeping Set. The BEAR 550 Initial Housekeeping
Set or B-550I (UTC XFBH1) is a standalone package providing the base camp with
environmentally controlled contingency quarters, feeding, and hygiene to support 550
personnel in small shelters (tents). The set includes 48 SSS for field contingency
quarters (12 people per tent on 576 cots), insect netting, environmental control units,
and two SSS for the self-help laundry. The set weighs 229 tons and requires 78 pallet
positions (six C-17s) to airlift.
4.8.3.9.5. BEAR 550 Follow-On Housekeeping Set. BEAR 550 Follow-On
Housekeeping Set or B-550F (UTC XFBBF) can be deployed after or in conjunction
with the 550I to support an additional 550 personnel. It provides additional field
contingency quarters, latrine, environment control unit (ECU), high and low voltage
electrical generation and distribution, water distribution and camp lighting. The set
weighs 188 tons and requires 61 pallet positions (five C-17s) to airlift. This is a
follow-on housekeeping set to support and establish the base. This is an additive
package to the B-550I set and increases the support to handle up to 1,100 personnel.
4.8.3.10. Contracted Commercial Quarters. If force protection conditions allow personnel
to reside off base, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and security forces
should coordinate prior to establishing contracted commercial quarters, and the site
commander should approve prior to implementation. Obtain contract quarters through the
local contracting office. There are two ways to obtain contract quarters.
4.8.3.10.1. Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). A BPA can establish single or double
occupancy rooms when called for by the contracting officer or designated
representative. The government can pay for all personnel lodged at the establishment
or personnel may be required to pay for the rooms on their own with government
reimbursement.
4.8.3.10.2. Requirements Type Contract. The requirements type contract provides
reservation for a specific number of rooms/beds for a specific period of time. When
utilizing this type of contract, another hotel can only be used when there is no more
room available at the contract hotel. Only the contracting officer or designated
representative can cancel reservations. Normally, the organization (US or foreign
government) pays for these type quarters.
4.8.4. Siting Considerations. The final step in plan development is to site the contingency
quarters operation. This requires deliberate coordination with EFSS leadership and CE to best
site the operation to support both near term mission requirements and allow for expansion as
the location matures. See Table 4.7, Shelter Siting Planning Factors.
 
 
4-12
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Table 4.7. Shelter Siting Planning Factors
4.8.4.1. Site Layout. CE site developers are responsible for site layout. Threat level
generally determines what site layout will look like. For example, one location may use
staggered (semi-dispersed) rows whereas another may employ symmetric rows.
Administrative offices are often located between contingency quarters and the ramp
facilities. Flight line operations facilities and shops, heavy equipment and industrial
support, and aerial port operations are usually along the ramp. To minimize noise and dust,
roadways to flight line and industrial areas are located away from contingency quarters
areas. See Figure 4.1, Layout Comparison to illustrate differences in layout.
Figure 4.1. Layout Comparison
4.8.4.2. Facility Group Layouts. Facility layout depends on the type of structure used. The
deployment plan may require semi-dispersed or dispersed layouts. Figure 4.2,
Semi-Dispersed and Dispersed Field Contingency Quarters Blocks shows the dimensions
necessary each layout for 24-tent/288-person setup.
1. Slope of terrain is < 18 feet over entire floor plan.
2. Area flat, high, dry, good drainage.
3. Away from traffic, noise, offensive smells, and intense security lighting. 
4. Accessible to foot, delivery, and emergency traffic.
5. Meets force protection and threat requirements. 
6. Latrine and shower/shave located nearby (but downwind from quarters and feeding 
facilities). 
7. Close to potable water source. 
8. Adequate for future expansion.
9. Adequate for conversion to semipermanent contingency quarters.

Figure 4.2. Semi-Dispersed and Dispersed Field Contingency Quarters Blocks
4.8.4.3. Semi-dispersed Formation. A semi-dispersed formation, the standard
arrangement for a tent city, is in neatly organized rows. Normally, this layout provides for
the maximum use of available space and is recommended when there is no enemy air
threat. The recommended minimum spacing is 12 feet between shelters and 30 feet
between rows of shelters. To make it easier for occupants to locate their facility, it is
recommended that the rows be named or numbered.
4.8.4.4. Dispersed Formation. If the deployment location is near hostile adversary actions,
the site commander may elect to have shelters arranged in a dispersed layout. This
arrangement would reduce the number of casualties if the site were attacked but requires
more space than semi-dispersed. Disadvantages of the dispersed layout are the need for
increased electrical and plumbing support and functional areas are sometimes separated
resulting in reduced efficiency of operations. CE should provide input regarding the ability
to provide electrical and plumbing support. To make it easier for occupants to locate their
facility, it is recommended that shelters be named or numbered.
4.9. Operate the Base. In this phase, Prime RIBS develop operational processes and procedures
to implement the contingency quarters plan maximizing the use of resources. This phase builds on
and compliments the open the base phase. In this phase, contingency quarters managers determine
how best to beddown forces from a bedspace management perspective while enacting managerial
processes and procedures.
4.9.1. Bedspace Management Considerations. The installation commander owns all
contingency quarters on the installation. There is no such thing as a deployed contingency
standard. The number of personnel to be housed, mission requirements, and the amounts and
types of assets available determines the local standard. EFSS leadership and contingency
quarters managers should develop site specific processes to beddown forces that factor in
diverse demographic occupancy standards for approval by the installation commander.
4.9.1.1. Unit Housing Representatives. As soon as practical, have each unit provide a unit
housing representative (UHR) who is appointed by the respective unit commander. Often,
the First Sergeant fills this role. This is the single person Prime RIBS work with to create

reservations, assign members to rooms/bedspaces, swap beds, perform room inspections,
account for personnel, and all other contingency quarters functions on behalf of the unit.
4.9.1.2. First-come, First-served. Assign people to quarters on a first-come first-served
basis or by unit or squadron. The first-come, first-served method allows for the most
efficient use of bed spaces but is the least used since units want their personnel housed near
each other.
4.9.1.3. During all phases of deployments, most units want their personnel to be housed
close to each other. Prime RIBS should make every effort to assign unit personnel in their
own sections and workers that work the same shift together. See Table 4.8, Potential
Contingency Quarters Breakouts.
NOTE: Some of these assignment considerations below may not be practical or warranted. The
installation commander decides which of these or other policies should apply.
Table 4.8. Potential Contingency Quarters Breakouts
4.9.1.4. Senior Staff. Identify senior officers (O6 and above) and senior enlisted (E9)
quarters as soon as possible. Typically, these are typically used to house group and wing
commanders and superintendents. When possible, general officers should be lodged one
per shelter. If, two very important persons (VIP) are required to share a shelter, erect
partitions to divide the structure into rooms. Coordinate the selection, arrangement, and
assignment of VIP quarters with the installation commander and CE. The protocol office
generally controls assignments to these facilities. Use semi-permanent or permanent
quarters first.
4.9.1.5. Distinguished Visitors. Typically, DVs are general officer or E9 by position and
civilian equivalents who are visiting the location for short durations. Coordinate the
selection, arrangement, and assignment of DV quarters with the installation commander
and protocol. The protocol office generally controls assignments to these facilities. Use
semi-permanent or permanent quarters first.
4.9.1.6. Officers. To the maximum extent possible, try to beddown squadron commanders
with other squadron commanders.
1. Flight crews (by type of aircraft, expected number of aircraft, and crew numbers).
2. Persons with Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) requiring crew rest.
3. Officer and senior non-commissioned officers (SNCO).
4. Men and women.
5. Civilians.

4.9.1.7. Crew Rest. Prime RIBS should ensure crew rest and crew integrity is maintained
for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) that require crew rest. Similar type career fields,
aircrews, and aircrews scheduled on the same flights, should be kept together. Setup crew
rest quarters in an area adequately separated from noise, lighting, traffic, and other
disruptions that would interfere with crew rest. Consider the use of existing permanent
structures instead of tents to reduce noise levels and allow for the maximum amount of
crew rest.
4.9.1.8. Female Officers and Enlisted. During the planning phase, attempt to obtain from
UHRs or PERSCO the number of females that are inbound. The planning factor for
females is approximately 20 percent of the beddown population. When space is limited,
ask the installation commander if it is permissible to lodge officers and enlisted females in
the same shelter. Lodge all females close to female latrines and showers. Be aware that
during emergency conditions, temporary partitions in sleeping shelters and time-sharing of
latrine and shower facilities by males and females may be necessary and should be
approved by the installation commander.
4.9.1.9. Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCO). The planning factor for all SNCOs is
approximately 13 percent. E9s should be beddown together. SNCOs should be beddown
together within the same unit when practical.
4.9.1.10. Civilians. DOD civilian employees should be beddown at the same standard as
their military counterparts. For contractors, beddown is accomplished in accordance with
their contract or based on installation commander guidance. Contract personnel should be
beddown within the same facilities.
4.9.1.11. Operations. Operations is the framework to effectively manage contingency
quarters operations. It codifies how Prime RIBS systematically manage bedspace
assignments and other managerial functions.
4.9.2. Front Desk. Limit the number of front desk operations to the minimum number
necessary. Control all bed space assignments and terminations through the front desk.
4.9.3. Reception Briefings. Contingency quarters personnel should brief arriving passengers
as a group and issue bedspaces (if UHRs haven’t been established yet). The introductory
briefing should also address safety and quarters responsibilities.
4.9.4. Accountability of Personnel. Prime RIBS managers should work closely with
PERSCO. PERSCO can provide a roster of deployed personnel that contingency quarters
managers can compare to their registration/locator system for accountability of bed space
purposes.
4.9.5. Registration/Locator System. There are several methods for registration of deployed
members. Prime RIBS members should operate a locator system to account for personnel in all
contingency quarters to include facility number, room number, and bedspace number.
Tracking of personnel information and assignment to a bed space is handled on an AF Form
245, Employment Locator and Processing Checklist and/or an electronic spreadsheet or other
contingency quarters programs.
4.9.5.1. AF Form 245. The AF Form 245 may also serve as a hand receipt for equipment
issued from the contingency quarters office. AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt can
 
 
4-16
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
also be used for equipment issued from contingency quarters. Assignment tracking is
important not only for personnel accounting, but also for issuing or tracking initial support
assets (i.e., cots, bedding [except unit sleeping bags], furniture or equipment).
4.9.5.2. Electronic Registration/Locator System. If computers are available, the use of
Microsoft Excel® or other contingency quarters programs can be used in lieu of the AF
Form 245 for locator purposes and is the preferred method.
4.9.6. Tent or Room Swapping. Prime RIBS should advise all commanders and First
Sergeants that everyone should stay in their originally assigned quarters. If swapping is
necessary, all requests should be submitted through the UHR to the contingency quarters
operation for approval.
4.9.7. Custodial Duties. The ranking person in each tent or room is responsible for ensuring
quarters are kept clean and trash is removed. The site commander should sign a written policy
concerning housekeeping duties and all incoming personnel should be briefed. Once
contingency quarters transitions to more permanent structures, the cleaning of common areas
should be added to the base custodial contract.
4.9.8. Force Rotations. Even though most unit populations may remain relatively stable,
there are rotational surges when one AFFORGEN rotation is arriving and the other departing
after a short overlap. There are many ways to handle this overlap surge. Sometimes the major
surge population can be accommodated with extra space provided by bunk beds. Sometimes
larger transient shelters (medium shelters) within the community area can be used with cots
and sleeping bags or spare frames and mattresses.
4.9.8.1. Outbound Forces. If force rotations require the use of transient facilities, it is
recommended to move the outgoing forces to the transient facilities when they prepare to
depart. This permits inbound forces to get situated in their permanently assigned bedspace
upon arrival to be able to focus on the mission.
4.9.8.2. Rotational Concerns. A common QoL concern during rotational changeover is to
ensure that the incoming rotation does not inherit dirty living quarters from the outgoing
rotation. Prime RIBS should work closely with UHRs to ensure all quarters are cleaned
and areas around them are maintained. See Figure 4.3, Transient Contingency Quarters
Facility.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
4-17
 
 
Figure 4.3. Transient Contingency Quarters Facility
4.9.8.3. Adjusting Space Allocations. It is wise to review and adjust allocation of space
for the increase/decrease in mission forces for each force rotation. Prime RIBS should
work with UHRs to allocate amenities and space and to prevent both perceived and actual
difference in levels of support and quality. If all units do not rotate at the same time
(common with joint operation), avoid moving large groups of personnel in a mass shuffle
in order to reallocate space and reorganize units. If mass shuffles are required, try to limit
them to once a rotation (for the rotation being moved).
4.9.9. Supplies and Waste. Contingency quarters is responsible for initial issue items such as
cleaning supplies, cots or beds, linens, and pillows (if available at the site) as well as stocking
additional supplies in the event that the base population increases. Remember to coordinate all
supply needs through the deployed supply representatives and contracting for local purchase
needs. Coordinate with CE on the locations of trash collection and adequate pick-up times.
4.9.10. Safety. Coordinate with the fire department for safety protocols to be enacted. Fire
extinguishers must be available for each facility and placed in conspicuous areas easily
accessible in case of an emergency. Extinguishers are available from the fire department.
4.10. Sustain the Base. If a location is designated as a semi-permanent contingency location
(generally 24 months or greater), sustainment efforts usually allow for more semipermanent
structures and utilities. At this point, EFSS and CE work together to obtain equipment and shelters
(such as hard-wall or constructed facilities) to replace WRM assets. Refer to AFI 25-101.
4.10.1. Quality of Life. Shelters and facilities revolve around factors such as individual space
and storage, improved beds, common areas with shared furnishings, and added amenities. QoL
outside of each person’s contingency quarters area can be improved by providing for common
covered rest areas, walkways, and convenient access to support facilities (e.g., latrines,
shower-shave areas, fitness and recreation, laundry, and dining facilities).
4.10.2. Planning for Sustainment. The manager’s primary goals for sustainment operations
are to improve contingency quarters conditions, promote health, safety, and morale, and also
meet mission and force requirements. The location may become a long-term support location
 
 
4-18
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
and allow for upgrading to semi-permanent facilities or may remain a short-term location that
uses WRM. Considerations in both situations are:
4.10.2.1. Increased Minimum Standards. There are increased minimum square footage
standards that should be met during sustainment. In the open and operate the base phases,
deployers were provided a minimum of 40 net square feet per person, or 12 persons per
SSS. In sustainment, the goal is to provide approximately 93 net square feet per person, or
6 to 8 persons per SSS.
4.10.2.2. Permanent Facilities. Facilities should be sized to meet minimum requirements.
Policies regarding standards for contingency quarters are outlined in Air Force Pamphlet
(AFPAM) 10-219, Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning and War Mobilization Plan
(WMP)-1. Components (i.e., Air Forces Central [AFCENT]) and combatant commands
(i.e., United States Central Command [USCENTCOM]) may have AOR specific
contingency quarters standards that drive planning factors while deployed to the applicable
AOR. See Table 4.9, Minimum Contingency Quarters Standards.

4.10.3. Semipermanent Facilities. As the sustainment lengthens and the population
stabilizes, CE should start making the site more permanent. Transitioning to hardened shelters
(modular facilities, trailers, pre-engineered buildings) is one way of improving the QoL for
both the community and facility managers.
4.10.4. Locally Constructed or Portable Modular Buildings. Prime RIBS is responsible
for defining the requirement for more enduring contingency quarters facilities such as trailers,
modular facilities, pre-engineered buildings (PEB), and traditional brick and mortar facilities
based on local mission requirements. This includes the number of bedspaces necessary,
normal and surge capacity required, and desired types of construction materials. The
requirement is provided to CE for further planning and execution.
4.10.5. WRM Management. During sustainment operations, Theater planners provide
direction on what WRM to return and how to return it. In addition to base-directed efforts,
Theaters normally have central contracts to reconstitute and return equipment. EFSS need to
work with component planners and base logistics readiness to determine what WRM needs to
be returned. Document actions in continuity files to provide follow-on rotations with
information on what WRM is leaving and what is budgeted to replace existing WRM
resources. Maintain good records regarding numbers of personnel supported to allow
replacement.
4.10.6. Improved Accessibility of Support Areas. Sustainment is a time to improve the
accessibility of various support areas (e.g., dining facilities, recreation, latrines, shower, and
shave units) for personnel in contingency quarters. If the sustainment mission population is
lower than the initial beddown estimates, this provides an opportunity to expand and alleviate

tightly spaced tent city communities and regroup personnel by mission and function after
mission populations stabilize. Maintain good records regarding numbers of personnel
supported to allow replacement and upgrade planning of latrines, showers, and shave facilities
that support the contingency quarters complex.
4.11. Expansion. Some locations may have areas for future expansion of contingency quarters. If
not, contingency quarters support for new missions may have to be on the other side of a ramp, at
a geographically separated area, or near industrial or storage areas (that are free of excessive noise,
dust, and lighting). While this can create duplication of efforts and facilities, it may be
unavoidable if there is insufficient land to allow for onsite expansion.
4.12. Furnishings. If not already begun, sustainment is the time to increase the QoL of deployers
by transitioning from cots and sleeping bags to bunkbeds with mattresses, pillows, and linens.
Wall lockers, nightstands, and common areas are all ways to improve deployed life. Work with
Theater Service planners and contracting to define purchase requirements.
4.13. Laundry/Linen Operations. Open and operate the base laundry operations are typically
provided by UTC self-help laundry (SHL) systems. As the base enters sustainment, a mix of
contracts and commercially procured laundry components form the backbone of the laundry and
linen operations.
4.13.1. Facilities and equipment. This influences the level of support for laundry services.
There are currently three types of contingency laundry services available, and a combination
of these laundry services are often required.
4.13.1.1. SHL System (UTC XFWLS) provides austere base with self-help laundry
capability for up to 550 personnel. Includes 1x SSS, 10x washers, 20x dryers, and mobility
readiness spares package (MRSP). Provides cables/connectors for interface with power
distribution.
4.13.1.2. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) units are locally procured units for cleaning
personal laundry and certain organizational linen. EFSS works with CE to provide facility
and utilities. If possible, equipment maintenance should be included in the purchase
agreement or through a separate maintenance contract.
4.13.1.3. Contract linen service can be a full contract service or a partial contract service
that just cleans organizational items, including medical laundry. When using a partial
contract, provide SHL facilities to perform personal laundry. Consult with Theater
Services Planners and the contracting officer to determine available methods (i.e., local
contract, central theater contract, contractor augmentation program).
4.13.2. Open the Base Actions. The minimum planning factors for laundry and linen are
outlined in Table 4.10, Laundry Operation Planning Factors. These figures help plan for
laundry services from initial deployment through sustainment. During the open and operate
the base phase of deployment, SHL should be on hand or already ordered as part of WRM
assets.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
4-21
 
 
Table 4.10. Laundry Operation Planning Factors
4.13.2.1. It is highly recommended to double the number of SHL Systems. While the
planning factor is 10 washers and 20 dryers for 550 personnel, recommend 2 UTCs or 20
washers and 40 dryers to support 550 personnel to reduce customer wait times and build
residual capacity as washers and dryers become inoperable. Immediately begin sourcing to
purchase commercial washers and dryers to replace the WRM assets.
4.13.2.2. Additional Considerations. Determine if any short- or long-term geographic,
weather, or medical factors would require adjusting the WMP factors. For arid regions, the
availability of water could affect laundry services during the initial beddown until all
sources are developed. The system is equipped with benches, laundry products with basic
instructions, folding tables, trash receptacles, and temporary hanging racks/lines/hooks. If
self-help laundries become a minor gathering place, consider providing some amenities
when possible, such as a covered porch with additional chairs, small tables, additional
lighting for reading, or card games.
4.13.2.3. Medical Support. Medical laundry support is required when a medical unit is
located on the base. It is highly recommended that a separate WRM or COTS SHL system
be procured specifically for medical laundry support until a contract can be in place. This
reduces the potential for transmission of biological hazards and frees-up SHL assets for the
base populace. See Table 4.11, Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) Planning
Factors.
Table 4.11. Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) Planning Factors
4.13.2.3.1. Medical Laundry Support Issues. Medical laundries have higher
cleanliness needs and present greater hazards (i.e., medical biohazards) than normal
laundry. Some biohazard clothing and linens should be segregated and maintained

separately prior to cleaning. This presents logistics problems for the medical unit,
EFSS, and the transporters. Obtain contract support when possible, but keep in mind
that using off-base contractors may cause security and cleanliness concerns.
4.13.3. Operate and Sustain the Base Actions. This is the time to ensure there is enough
capability to provide laundry support. Even if contract support is obtained, having adequate
SHL centers is still a requirement. Providing deployed personnel with SHLs that offer them
the ability to quickly wash items is more than just a convenience. It can greatly reduce the
number of items included in standard contracts. EFSS should work with CE to overcome any
problems with SHL systems. See Figure 4.4, SHL Using COTS.
4.13.3.1. Transition from WRM to COTS. As Prime RIBS transition from WRM to COTS
SHL, work closely with CE for required utilities and to site them in convenient proximity
to contingency quarters.
4.13.3.1.1. Installed units, both current and planned for purchase, should be wired for
either dual power or to match the existing power supply used on base.
4.13.3.1.2. Equipment, both current and planned for purchase, should have
maintenance contracts and/or spare parts in place.
4.13.3.1.3. Spare washers and dryers should be in stock. Determine how many spares
are needed based on rates of use and any savings from not having to contract for
additional capacity.
4.13.3.1.4. Meet with expeditionary civil engineer squadron (ECES) and determine a
realistic, acceptable standard for repairing machines and having machines out of order.
4.13.3.1.5. Ensure system in place for self-identifying or having someone report
equipment that is out of service.

Figure 4.4. SHL Using COTS
4.13.3.2. Establishing Contract Laundry/Linen. If SHL has been the sole source for
laundry support, Prime RIBS can raise the QoL of laundry and linen support by
implementing contracts. The major emphasis for sustainment laundry and linen support is
to obtain contracts to support linen and laundry service to obtain a three- to four-day
turnaround on clothing if possible. When limited by on-base water and power problems,
seek off-base contracts if force protection permits.
4.13.3.2.1. Based on populations and organizations, calculate total weekly or monthly
laundry requirements based on types of laundry service required (personal, medical,
and organizational), as well as linen/bedding service requirements. If contract services
are provided, site the facilities and develop procedures for picking up and dropping off.
Laundry guidelines should be established and posted where customers can clearly see
them.
4.13.3.2.2. Organizational items include coveralls, flight suits, field jackets, and
aprons.
4.13.3.3. Dry Cleaning. If a contractor is accessible, try to obtain dry cleaning service as a
QoL improvement.

Chapter 5
CH5 CONTINGENCY FEEDING OPERATIONS
CONTINGENCY FEEDING OPERATIONS
5.1. Overview. This chapter provides TTP to support contingency feeding operations. EFSS
facilities and levels of service will be phased over time from minimum essential levels early in the
contingency to full operational levels as outlined in the War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1,
Services Supplement. Food service, contingency quarters, mortuary services, and laundry are
minimum activities provided at all locations during all phases of operations. Theater of operations
employment is accomplished by a mix of in-place services forces, deployed Prime RIBS forces,
local host-nation support, and contractor support.
5.2. Operations. Contingency feeding operations provide meals while operating from a variety
of facilities using commercial grade, field feeding equipment, or a combination of both. Flight
feeding operations are provided at locations with aircraft missions. Hospital feeding is required for
patients as an additional requirement of support provided to the main force population. Regular
and therapeutic flight meals are required for medical air evacuees. Nutritional medical personnel
determine, order, and prepare specialized patient meals.
5.3. Procurement. Obtaining food and food supplies is a services mission. Initially, subsistence
will be provided by a push system by the air component via the Air Force Services Center
(AFSVC) and supporting MAJCOM. Depending upon length of deployment, a pull system is
usually implemented for sustained operations. On-site food service managers requisition
subsistence from the rear echelon (i.e., pulling what is needed forward). Medical diet technicians
determine medical unique ration requirements and provide this requirement to the theater service
planners for consolidation into a theater ration requirement.
5.4. Roles and Missions. Food service procures food items from US Army Public Health Center
(APHC) approved and established government sources through various means (e.g., WRM, US
vendors, or local contractors). Food is received from procurement sources, inspected for
suitability, and then stored appropriately (e.g., refrigerated or dry storage). Food items are
properly sanitized then prepared for consumption and served to Airmen. Feeding operations
develop disposal procedures for generated waste (i.e., uneaten food, paper, grease).
5.5. Capabilities. Initial feeding capabilities for opening an airbase are provided through MREs.
As beddown operations progress, feeding moves to UGRs. The final capability goal is to transition
to hot meals using perishable, semi-perishable, and nonperishable food stocks (A-rations).
5.6. Deployed Planning Assumptions. The primary planning assumption is that food service
support will be phased in consistently with the force element planning guidance. The required
personnel and material UTC packages should be available to grow increased capability at the
designated phase points. This process is applicable to any scenario (e.g., humanitarian assistance
mission, small scale contingency, major theater war).
5.7. Open the Airbase. In the open the airbase package, contingency response forces are
responsible for securing the base and establishing initial airfield and communication operations.
For this short-term effort, personnel are supported by assets that meet minimum standards for
living, comfort, and health requirements. The open the airbase force element plans to be on the
ground for 2 to 3 days and then redeploy to open other contingency locations. There are no
services personnel in the open the airbase force element; therefore, this team deploys with MREs
and bottled water.
 
 
5-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
5.8. Site Considerations. A food service manager arriving at a bare base location has a more
formidable challenge in establishing a sound feeding activity than one who arrives at an already
operating fixed facility. Laying out an initial facility requires an array of considerations that
impact other activities beyond the food service functions. Work closely with CE counterparts to
ensure that current (and future) food service site considerations are taken into account early in the
development of the base. Plan for expansion and the ability to operate from either temporary or
fixed facilities. In addition to the standard requirements to be placed in relatively flat and well
drained locations, food service facilities require good access roads, but not roads that have high
traffic and create dust.
5.8.1. Food Service Layout and Requirements. Food service personnel may be able to set a
majority of the systems without major assistance. Layout of kitchens and dining facilities,
large subsistence storage, and additional flightline or flight kitchens are driven by the base
population, layout, and supply availability. Most dining facilities should be located adjacent to
contingency quarters functions. For larger populations that can justify a second or third
kitchen, one of the dining facilities may be located closer to the flightline or primary work
areas. If it is not feasible to locate a full kitchen closer to the primary work areas, then a field
feeding platform may be an option to absorb the workload for flight meals in the flightline
area. Since a primary objective is to locate the field exchange near the primary dining facility,
position multiple primary dining facilities within close proximity, when possible, to help
centralize food service operations and allow the use of one larger field exchange. The dining
facility block site should also have adequate potable water and electric power with backup
capability (although it may be limited) and access to waste receptacles.
5.8.2. Facility Set-Up. The prime base engineer emergency force (BEEF) team is responsible
for the site infrastructure, water/waste, power production, environmental, testing water for
purification, and entomology programs. Ensure all requirements for field food service is
coordinated with the prime BEEF team for beddown support.
5.8.2.1. For large populations with multiple food service operations, consider using a
centralized subsistence and rations storage facility. Centralized storage provides better
management controls, cuts down on movement of rations from various delivery sources
(e.g., theater and overseas military delivery, local sources, and prime vendor
[https://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/Subsistence/Foodservices.aspx]), and allows for
better facility control (i.e., security from theft and sabotage, entomology support, better
weather protection).
5.8.2.2. When possible, plan to have the area central to several dining facilities. This will
make it easier to transport smaller loads of rations to the storage locations at the dining
facility.
5.8.2.3. Allow space for placement of physical protective measures as appropriate.
5.8.2.4. Storage temperature is crucial. See manufactures manual for shelf-life
information. Refer to public health for further guidance. If supply lines or replacement
times are long and subsistence reorders must rely on large bulk shipments instead of
smaller regular shipments, then plan for a larger centralized location that is covered, has
temperature-controlled areas for perishables, has hard interior storage surfaces, and
heavier load bearing loading areas.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
5-3
 
 
5.8.2.5. Coordinate as necessary with contracting, supply, transportation, CE, security
forces, and aerial port personnel to identify the best location for a large centralized storage
facility (3 square foot per person).
5.8.3. Equipment Systems. Food service activities have been conducted from the most basic
shelters through elaborate fixed facilities. Food operations should consider extreme weather
conditions as many locations experience the effects of weather on their resources. Weather
conditions can affect life expectancy and capabilities of facilities and equipment. Ensure
proper maintenance is being conducted to maximize its operational life. The following
sections provide overviews of current structures and systems the deployed food service
manager may work with.
5.8.3.1. BEAR Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen (SPEK). The SPEK is a lightweight,
quick response kitchen designed to provide hot meals using UGR heat and serve (H&S). It
provides UGRs for approximately 550 people per meal using high-efficiency burner
technology. A team of 6 personnel can ready the platform and start feeding within 4 hours
of arrival of rations and equipment. Designed for initial contingency feeding and for
periods up to 30 days. WRM SPEKs arrive palletized in a dedicated expandable container,
while base owned systems use a three-section tent, extendable, modular, personnel
(TEMPER) tent. It operates with a packaged generator. When the location receives a
BEAR kitchen, the SPEK may be incorporated into the BEAR, moved to another on-site
location to support flightline meals or an isolated portion of the site, or reconstituted and
repackaged for return or deployment elsewhere. See Figure 5.1, Serving and Eating Out of
a SPEK.

5.8.3.2. The BEAR Type I portable electric kitchen (PEK) is all electric and provides an
austere base with the messing capability to feed up to 550 personnel with three UGR-H&S
meals, three UGR-A, or three hot meals per day. The BEAR Type I PEK enables 11 cooks
to prepare a hot meal in a maximum of three hours. All tools, supplies, or equipment,
except electrical and water supplies, that are required to unpack, set up, operate, maintain,
strike, and repack the facility are supplied in six BICON/internal slingable unit (ISU)-90
shipping containers. One complete BEAR Type I PEK consists of five distinct subsystems:
appliance/equipment, electrical, water, shelter, and flooring. It can be completely set up
and operational by a crew of 10 personnel within four, 12-hour duty days and completely
disassembled and repacked within three, 12-hour duty days. Select a site that is
approximately 140 feet by 100 feet that is relatively level, has good drainage, is free of
rocks and underbrush, is sheltered from high winds, and accessible to the rest of the
installation. All tools, components, and equipment, except electrical and water sources,
that are required to unpack, set-up, operate, maintain, strike, and repack the facility are
supplied in the shipping containers. See Figure 5.2, PEK.

5.9. Establish the Airbase. The establish element brings in the assets required to prepare the
base to receive the weapon systems and other support aircraft. The components of this element
bring the beddown to IOC to receive the operate the base force element, typically the weapon

system (e.g., fighters, tankers, or tactical airlift). It provides for fielding of the life-sustaining
functions necessary for force beddown and base operating support (BOS).
5.9.1. Functions. Primary functions include field feeding (to transition from MREs to hot
meals), contingency quarters, mortuary affairs, and laundry support. The core force support
and CE UTCs begin arriving during this phase of intense beddown operations. Theater
contract or contractor augmentation programs can be used in areas that are not high threat. If
the threat increases during this phase and contracts were planned for use, essential services and
contingency plans should be identified and plans developed to prevent loss of support for
essential services functions.
5.9.2. Site Preparation. Prime RIBS personnel, along with engineers (e.g., prime BEEF,
rapid engineer deployable heavy operational repair squadron engineer [RED HORSE], or 49th
Materiel Maintenance Group [MMG] BEAR installation team personnel), prepare the site and
erect and install facilities, equipment, and utilities. When threat conditions allow it, planners
can consider use of a theater established contractor or one of the contractor augmentation
programs (e.g., Air Force Contract Augmentation Program [AFCAP], Army Logistics Civilian
Augmentation Program [LOGCAP], or Navy Construction Capabilities [CONCAP] contract)
to support some early beddown functions.
5.9.3. Special Teams. Food service personnel may not be included early in the deployment of
special teams (e.g., air mobility operations groups [AMOG], contingency response forces, or
special tactics team [STT]). During this period, food service managers should begin to work
closely with deployed counterparts—particularly CE—to prepare for siting and build-up of
facilities.
5.9.4. Feeding Platform Progression. Initial feeding platform provides a combination of
MREs and UGRs with food service transition to three hot meals per day by Day 30. These
meals may initially be in the form of UGRs with health officer approved, locally obtained
supplements. Pre-prepared rations may also be used, consistent with menu guidelines to help
meet the unique needs presented by rapidly increasing populations or unexpected surge
conditions. The end game is to be ready to use newly arriving A-rations with the availability of
more comprehensive kitchen capabilities provided by BEAR sets. As these assets arrive and
are sited and erected, earlier-deployed platforms may assume roles as satellite feeding
activities or may be identified to move to a forward location to support the same phasing
process at another site. Planning for the next phase takes place at this point as contracting and
sustainment options are considered.
5.10. Types of Rations. There are several types of meals offered that should be covered in the
planning stages (e.g., MREs, UGRs, A-rations).
5.10.1. Storage of Rations. General guidance is to check the date of the packaging and also
check the condition of the packaging. Inspect for pests monthly, however during the warmer
months inspect rations more frequently. Conduct inspections on the condition of containers
and on closed packages (e.g., cans, boxes).
5.10.2. MREs. This is the most preferred option for use in the field because it has no unique
requirements. In the initial planning phase, consider the UTC for rations (RFSEM). Plan ahead
before the initial supply of MREs are depleted and plan for requirements to maintain feeding
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
5-7
 
 
operations. Consider possible extensive lead times when placing MRE orders. Work with the
MAJCOM and/or theater service planner to begin planning for this requirement.
5.10.2.1. The contents of the UTC are transported on one 463L aircraft pallet. The 463L
pallet will be loaded with eight wooden pallets each containing 48 cases of MREs. Each
case contains 12 individual meals for a total of 3,456 MREs per UTC or 288 cases. This
UTC will feed a population of 1,100 people two meals per day for one and one-half days.
5.10.2.2. MRE Storage. MREs can quickly lose shelf life when exposed to the high
temperatures. Store in a temperature-controlled container or facility. See Figure 5.3, MRE
Storage.
Figure 5.3. MRE Storage
5.10.3. UGRs. This field feeding option is the transition point from MREs to A-rations.
Operations should ensure they have the appropriate field feeding platform and storage
capabilities to support these rations. To obtain UGRs, the food manager should work with the
MAJCOM and/or theater service planner. Consider lead-time when placing UGR orders.
5.10.4. UGR-As (with supplements). Require the same capabilities to include refrigeration.
The food manager should work with the MAJCOM and/or theater service planner to acquire
the supplements needed for UGR-As. Consider possible extensive lead times for orders.
5.10.5. Supplements. Offer supplements based off the monetary difference (within the
respective meal period) from the current basic daily food allowance (BDFA) and current
calendar year (CY) DOD meal rate prices. BDFA minus CY meal rate meal period equals the
supplement allowance.
 
 
5-8
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
5.11. Operate the Airbase. The operate element brings mission support forces needed to achieve
full operating capability and sustain mission generation beyond 30 days. The resources provide
capabilities to bolster force protection, communications, cargo handling, and quality of life
activities (e.g., additional feeding, contingency quarters) and provides reach-back capability for
supply, US Mail, and military pay.
5.11.1. A-Rations. The food service manager’s goal during operate the base phase should be
to establish a reliable A-rations pipeline. A-rations require the appropriate field feeding
platform to support this ration. The worldwide menu should become the standard for overall
meal planning when A-rations have become your main source of subsistence. Work with the
MAJCOM and/or theater service planner and AFSVC/SVOF plan for this requirement.
Managers should begin the process of establishing a local contract option for mess attendant or
full food service support.
5.11.2. Ground Support Feeding. In some deployed locations, a ground support feeding
requirement may be established. Managers should create an ordering process for providing hot
meals to members that cannot dine due to mission requirements. Ensure all meals are
accounted for on the appropriate forms.
5.11.3. Flightline Feeding. At locations with an established airfield, a flightline feeding
operation could be required. Flightline kitchen may be collocated in the main field kitchen to
maximize manpower. A separate facility may be justified based on geographic separation,
high operations-side population, limited shift break capability (partly time-distance based),
transient aircraft, and need to manage a surge capability. These are all reasons to plan for a
flightline feeding capability and possibly a dining facility (DFAC). Manpower for the flight
kitchen is included in the current capability of the Prime RIBS UTC. There are several types
of meals offered that should be covered in the planning stages.
5.11.3.1. Flight Meals. MREs are the most preferred flight meal option because it has no
unique requirements. In some circumstances, aircrews may have special requirements
based on the nature of the mission. These meals can be labor intensive and will require
refrigeration and unique packaging. Limit the use of the sandwich meal to flights requiring
one meal or as the first meal on a long flight. These meals should be eaten within 4 hours
after issue. The time of issue to consumption can be extended up to 12 hours if stored at 42
degrees Fahrenheit or below.
5.11.3.2. Contracted Flight Meals. For some locations, the option may be available to
contract flight meals (e.g., when near a commercial airport that has in-flight services).
Even when available, this option may be very limited by security concerns. While having
a full operations-side DFAC can limit manpower capabilities to support other serving
options, sometimes it is the best option if it satisfies in-flight, flightline, and aircrew
feeding needs out of one facility.
5.11.4. Dining Facility Manager Roles and Responsibilities. Food managers should utilize
the AFSVC portal for helpful documents/information.
5.11.4.1. Managers verify subsistence orders for quantity accuracy when feeding the base.
This includes all types of rations. Ensure all rations are being stored and secured properly.
5.11.4.2. Managers verify the inventory is conducted twice a month for reporting to
respective MAJCOM or theater service planner and AFSVC.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
5-9
 
 
5.11.4.3. Managers need to have a plan and location to secure controlled forms at all
times. Food managers are required to verify the AF Form 1119-1, Field Feeding Monthly
Monetary Record is filled out in its entirety and with the most accurate data.
5.11.4.4. Managers use a single copy AF Form 1650b, Field Feeding Summary each day
to recap the meals served.
5.11.4.5. Managers post accounting data daily and the last day of each month on the AF
Form 1119-1.
5.11.4.6. Managers will ensure signatures are collected on all the AF Form 79, Headcount
Records that are utilized during each meal period.
5.11.5. Storage and Storeroom Operations. The primary focus is to determine the total
number of meals to be served. Anticipate surge figures during rotation overlaps to include any
holidays. Menu planning and subsistence ordering are based on meal preparations to serve 100
percent of the base population. Figures are obtained from PERSCO.
5.11.5.1. Storage. Storage at a DFAC is a major planning issue. Although square
footage, power, and location specifics are critical, so are less obvious concerns such as
physical security and access control. Do not forget these considerations when improving
capabilities. Contact the respective MAJCOM or Theater Services Planner and AFSVC
representative ahead of item delivery to assist in determining the storage space needed for
operation.
5.11.5.2. Storing Subsistence—Food and Water. Subsistence warehouse management has
been identified by commanders as one of the more crucial areas requiring experienced
personnel. Without developing the abilities to (1) offload and transport to storage, (2) store
within the appropriate storage conditions (e.g., dry, refrigerated, and cold), and (3) reload
and transport to food preparation areas, feeding operation efforts can be wasted. The
facilities for storage should have the capabilities of expansion with square footage and
enough power to support. The quantities, types of food, and the length of storage time
determines the warehousing operations, subsistence handling equipment, and vehicles
required.
5.11.5.3. Locations that cannot obtain large freezer units or warehouse complexes should
take actions to improve food storage operations. Obtain necessary material handling
equipment as previously described. Install or construct hard, impervious floors in
warehouses and food storage and preparation areas subject to heavy traffic and wheel
loads. Install widened doorframes in shelters where pallet jacks and loading are required.
Contact the local CE and contracting units to assist on installation or construction of an
improvised warehouse.
5.11.5.4. A key issue for storing food subsistence is storing and distributing the bottled
water component. Food service operations that lack a water distribution system must
obtain potable water source(s) to maintain DFAC operations. Many food service
equipment items are set up to use piped water. Having to transport bottles of water
throughout the kitchen can present hazards and requires additional personnel or longer
hours to manage the water at a DFAC.
 
 
5-10
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
5.12. Sustainment Planning. Sustainment planning begins almost immediately after operations
commence. Sustainment may cover any period of time from a few days to many years. Unless
briefed otherwise, food service managers should assume that operations will expand, the customer
base will enlarge, menu choices will increase, and more comfortable, convenient facilities will be
desired by site personnel. Sustainment efforts normally address the transition to A-rations.
Planning generally falls into three categories: (1) obtaining subsistence (location, what rations can
be obtained, how long it takes to receive them); (2) storing subsistence (how rations are received,
how are rations offloaded and loaded rations, how long can rations be kept without spoilage?); and
(3) cooking and support preparation times (can the site cook all ration items on a menu, is there
time to cook and clean, can someone else clean, can someone else cook?). These areas and the
related questions should be considered when planning to order, cook, and serve rations.
5.12.1. Functions. Sustainment functions support the long-term operations of the base. It
includes replacement of personnel and upgrade of equipment, facilities, and utilities for longer
term operations. It may include enhanced contract support and transition to more permanent
facilities and equipment. During this phase, food service managers should have a reliable
A-ration pipeline established. Facilities should also be fully established, with plans underway
for expansion concurrent with the arrival of additional BEAR equipment. When feasible, local
contracting options for food attendant and partial or full food service support should be
explored and implemented. Existing feeding platforms may be utilized as flightline or flight
kitchen activities with the arrival of additional food service manpower (subject to base
population targets). Plan a multi-day rotating menu once facilities have been established and
can support such a plan. Work with the MAJCOM and/or theater service planner and
AFSVC/VMFA plan for this requirement.
5.12.2. Cooking and Support Preparation Times. Normal deployment meal preparation is
based on providing three hot meals per day. The minimum day-meal requirements are: one
meat entrée, two vegetables, one starch, one soup, one dessert, and three beverages. These are
the minimum requirements for the initial 30 days. When there is available manpower and
facilities, increase the menu options. During sustainment, food service should determine their
location’s layout, military and support demographics, and work schedules to identify the best
ways to provide meals for personnel.
5.12.2.1. For compact base locations where the DFAC is central to contingency quarters
and support facilities (cantonment area) as well as flightline, operations, and maintenance
facilities (i.e., the operations-side), all DFAC operations can be consolidated and a
midnight meal provided. At these locations, some bases have used their BEAR kitchens in
a dual kitchen-dining configuration.
5.12.2.2. Locations where the main cantonment area and operations-side functions are
separated, many units provide two primary DFACs during sustainment; a main cantonment
DFAC and a smaller operations-side flightline feeding facility based off requirements for a
full-size operations DFAC. Flightline feeding can cover numerous requirements, such as
aircrew flight meals as well as aircraft ground crew and industrial support shop personnel
(ground support meals). Additional operations-side meal requirements should be identified
for flightlines that support passengers and medical unit evacuation facilities. An
operations-side DFAC may be required if a small flightline feeding facility is not able to
handle all the requirements.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
5-11
 
 
5.12.3. Surges. Even if a base is not surging for a new mission, surge conditions may occur
during a rotation overlap. At some locations, redeployment may stretch out for a week or more
while awaiting airlift. Planning for rotational turnover surges is a must; plan for extra water,
meals, and trash requirements. Communications with PERSCO should be maintained to have
visibility over personnel inbound/outbound movements that can impact feeding requirements.
5.12.4. Equipment and Facilities. Sustainment food service actions should be worked in
concert with facility and utility upgrades. Contract-supplied equipment may replace or
augment WRM assets. If turning in WRM shelters and moving to fixed facilities, order all new
food service support equipment to replace WRM equipment that will be returned to storage.
Based on standard meals and the requirements by population, determine the kitchen storage,
preparation area, cooking, and serving area needs. Work with CE to ensure that any equipment
items ordered are compatible with the available and planned electrical systems: include hoods,
exhausts, and water systems. Additionally, contracts should be planned for kitchen equipment
repair and preventive maintenance.
5.12.4.1. The Defense Government Supply Center (DGSC) Customer Valued Contracting
section provides support to identify main support contract vendors that supply equipment
for outside the continental United States (OCONUS) locations (direct shipped to the
location when possible).
5.12.4.2. Ensure CE is providing adequate water support piped to the DFAC complex to
replace bottled water whenever possible. Replacement cooking equipment should provide
for an all-electric capability. The size of the DFAC should be based on DOD and theatre
facility standards.
5.12.5. Fixed Facility Transitions. For locations that will have a long-term presence or will
require the replacement of WRM assets that are wearing out or must be rotated to another
location, services should plan for obtaining more permanent or fixed facilities. This is done
with CE to ensure that all facilities, utilities, and other support requirements are planned,
programmed, and budgeted for in the primary planning documents that are approved by the
theater commander. Even though CE provides the justification and usually has the better
handle on what types of structures can be obtained (i.e., modular, pre-engineered, K-Span),
services still plays a major role in determining what is needed to support food service
operations. The size of the DFAC should be based on DOD and theatre facility standards.
Consider developing a functional diagram layout of how and where support functions will go
and then work with CE to find the structures that meet the needs.
5.12.5.1. Check with supporting Theater Services Planner to determine if standard designs
and factors have been adopted for DFACs and associated storage facilities.
5.12.5.2. Check storage planning factors to determine if the requirements are properly
stated in square feet or cubic feet per person for storage.
5.12.5.3. Food storage that can be stacked on taller shelving requires less square footage,
but more handling equipment and wider aisles.
5.12.5.4. Consider manpower, supplies, equipment, and vehicles. Sustainment planning
should consider requirements for receiving a shell structure, which must be filled with
separately ordered equipment and requires a lot of additional work by services and CE to
 
 
5-12
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
hook up equipment, or a structure with an already integrated equipment package, where
the furnishings and kitchen-serving utensils are the only needs.
5.12.5.5. At a long-term location, plan for both the current level of effort and the expected
long-term mission. In some cases, plan for an initial large mission and a smaller future
mission. When this is the case, plan for a large centralized DFAC (with a warehouse
complex to handle all present and future needs) and plan to use a small, less expensive,
kitchen package to serve the present mission. Whatever the feeding facility choices,
always plan for adequate primary warehousing and on-site storage (dry and refrigerated) at
each feeding facility to improve efficiency and surge capability.
5.12.6. Vehicle Requirements. The ELRS is responsible for providing all vehicle
requirements. Identify, contact, and coordinate with the ELRS for food service vehicle
requirements as early as possible.
5.12.7. Licensing. Of particular note is the fact that many deployed members overlook the
need for country-specific licensing and specialized vehicle training prior to deployment.
Ideally, some of the deploying food service members should be qualified to operate forklifts
and 2.5-ton trucks while possessing an international driver’s license. Ensure to work with
ELRS for any particular licenses that are required to operate special vehicles.
5.12.8. WRM and Specialized Equipment. Some deployed food service members find
themselves short of vehicles and feel they are not high on the priority list for WRM vehicles.
Vehicle and specialized equipment authorizations should be addressed early to support
warehousing subsistence. Vehicle needs include large flatbed or stake-side trucks, 10K
adverse terrain (AT) and 6K forklifts, and trucks with refrigerated boxes or insulated boxes
(depending on travel distances) for longer hauling. Numerous locations require vehicle
operations to go off base to obtain contract vendor support, as well as much larger vehicles to
transport escorts on base (usually requires a small bus or a large van). Evaluate the situation
and see if there are other vehicles that could meet requirements.
5.12.9. Requesting Equipment. Numerous follow-on units received equipment and supplies
without any idea as to why they were ordered or how they would be used. Some bases
downsized and missions transferred to other locations after the initial purchases were
submitted. Actions were not taken to forward the items on order to the new locations, leaving
the units that assumed the new missions without the needed equipment and supplies. Many
purchase documents lacked adequate justification and detailed information on who was to
receive equipment and why.
5.12.10. Supporting Agencies. While initial inventories of expendable supplies may vary in
their availability, local supply representatives, in conjunction with the on-site contracting
activity, are the main points of contact for establishing a reliable source of expendable supply
items. Contact the prime vendor as another source for storeroom operations until supplies are
established. Contact them early on to enable timely delivery of these important assets.
5.12.10.1. CE will be the main contact for planning at the beddown site. Begin working
with them as early as possible to identify on-site CE and services organizations and points
of contact for planning and beddown. Make sure facility power, sanitation, waste, and
water requirements are made known to them. Prime RIBS teams, and in particular, the
food service members, are manned only to support water operations in conjunction with
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
5-13
 
 
the preparation and serving of meals. It is the responsibility of the CE to manage potable
water for base hydration. How the potable water is obtained and disseminated is up to CE.
5.12.10.1.1. CE is responsible for providing enough potable water to sustain
operations in all environments for bases ranging from an austere bare base to a main
operating base. In austere environments, CE provides as a minimum of 18 gallons of
potable water and 12 gallons of nonpotable water a day per person, which equals 30
gallons total. Despite this requirement, DFACs have used bottled water because the
potable water became unpalatable due to heat and developed inadequate residual
chlorine levels.
5.12.10.1.2. Services personnel should work closely with CE to determine the best
method to provide an adequate potable water supply. For extreme arid conditions, CE
may have to install several 500- to 1000-gallon insulated and cover-protected water
storage tanks at the DFACs. Insulated potable water storage tanks usually use small
chillers and control pumps and can keep water fresh for several additional days.
5.12.10.1.3. Refer to AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5 for detailed information on water
sources, uses, treatment, distribution, and environmental factors in arid and non-arid
environments. A large section is devoted to describing proper water supply
requirements in the context of a bare base located in an arid environment where
sustainment efforts may face quantity restrictions.
5.12.10.2. Logistics Readiness. While efforts are underway to streamline the sources of
electrical power for deployed food service activities, food service managers may find it
necessary to coordinate early on with deployed logistics personnel for fuel requirements
needed to operate equipment. Establish requirements to expedite delivery and help
maintain continuity of operations. Contact the unit vehicle control officer (VCO) to
request vehicles (e.g., forklifts, flatbeds, stakeside trucks) in support of operations. The
VCO will coordinate with ELRS to handle the vehicle requests.
5.12.10.3. Public Health. APHC is responsible for the approval of food and bottled water
sources. Every effort should be made to procure food and bottled water from approved
sources as listed in the approved sources list. During operations where approved sources
are not available, contracting will consult with the public health officer for food
procurement and the bioenvironmental engineer for bottled water. Refer to
https://phc.amedd.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx.
5.12.10.4. Military Public Health (MPH). Besides the basic medical care, MPH personnel
are responsible for medical inspections, cleanliness of food service facilities, and
maintenance of health and hygiene standards for food service military, civilian and
contractor personnel. In addition, they ensure APHC-approved food and water sources are
utilized. Work closely with MPH to schedule the required physical exams and training
requirements to meet food safety and sanitation needs.
5.12.10.5. Security Forces. Security forces can provide considerations or restrictions
regarding threats (e.g., need for protection from direct or indirect fire). Identify food
service high-use facilities that could be targets. Work with CE and security forces
personnel on proposed layouts to meet siting criteria for standoff and separation distances
 
 
5-14
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
for expeditionary facilities, especially for primary gathering buildings or structures (i.e.,
facilities routinely occupied by 50 or more personnel).
5.12.10.6. Communications. The expeditionary communications squadron (ECS)
members can provide information on what communication systems will be available at the
location (e.g., telephones, cell phones, satellite phones, radios, fax, and computer
network). Determine if secure communications are required and coordinate installation
with communication personnel if necessary.
5.12.10.6.1. If a food service activity deploys with a shortage of LMRs, members
should work closely with ECS representatives early on to obtain additional LMRs and
cell phones via organic or contract means.
5.12.10.6.2. Adequate LMR Support. Food service operations tend to span significant
distances across the base where they may have flightline feeding, subsistence
offloading, and other operations. If the ECS cannot obtain secure LMRs, determine if
they can substitute with digital cell phones for the primary support areas and the
commander. Determine if non-secure local frequency radios can be purchased to
support non-sensitive major functions.
5.12.10.6.3. Adequate Numbers of Computers and Phones. A high priority is to obtain
additional computers and phone lines to support those functions that require direct
communications with continental United States (CONUS) support organizations. This
includes the subsistence warehousing and DFAC operations, the commander, and the
unit control center. Direct communications include Defense Switched Network (DSN)
phones and af.mil Internet access
5.12.10.7. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). By design, initial stocks of MREs and water
are likely to be followed closely by pre-arranged shipments of UGRs and eventually
A-rations. It is important to understand when the push of rations ends and the
responsibility to pull rations (initiate any follow-on) requests begins. The responsible
Theater Services Planner (e.g., 9 AF [AFCENT]/A1S) is the point of contact for
subsistence support from the prime vendor. All air components work with AFSVC/VMFA,
who work with DLA to determine support for all exercises and deployments. Contact the
theater Services representative to determine what type of feeding will be conducted.
Feeding requirements should be determined based on the availability of facilities,
contracts, and subsistence at deployed locations. Refer to
https://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/Subsistence/Foodservices.aspx.
5.12.10.8. Prime Vendor Involvement. Base requirements are given to the vendor as soon
as possible. Consistent communication with the vendor enables the manager to obtain the
products needed and try new products. Give the prime vendor adequate notification of
known surge requirements in order to meet needs. Designated food service personnel
should request access to Subsistence Total Order and Receipt Electronic System
(STORES) Web for ordering subsistence. Refer to https://www.stores.dla.mil/stores_web/.
5.12.10.9. Air Force Food and Beverage (VMFA). Prior to departing, contact the
MAJCOM or theater service planner to initiate A-rations coordination and availability.
Contact the respective representative for any special circumstances that may be in place or
that will need to be established for the contingency operation.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
5-15
 
 
5.12.10.10. Integrate with Headquarters for Support. One major lesson learned is that
whether operating under the open, establish, or operate phase of deployment, or during
sustainment, always know the command and supporting structure of the theater, the
supporting MAJCOM, Air Force, and DOD support agencies. With the increasing number
of countries being added as deployment locations, it is becoming harder to identify all the
various lines of support across the various combatant theaters and areas of responsibility.
Know what resources are out there to help.
5.12.10.10.1. Upon arrival at a location, contact the various levels of command and
support organizations to determine who does what for whom and the best way to reach
them.
5.12.10.10.2. Each location is different and theater organizations can vary, sometimes
even by various operations. Confirm what the theater’s supporting structure is and if
they are the lead for sustainment issues.
5.12.10.10.3. Some forward units may primarily work beddown and initial operations,
while more rearward units work sustainment issues. Determine if there is a forward
deployed operations center and supporting base services function for the theater (e.g.,
a combined air operations center [CAOC]). If not, contact the next office in the chain
of command with a services staff. Once contacted, establish who will provide
functional direction and identify if AFSVC Operations Directorate offices monitor or
provide direct support for specific functions (i.e., food ordering).
5.12.10.10.4. Some commands and component commands provide briefings on
current theater support methods prior to departure.
5.12.10.10.5. Determine with CE what the shelter replacement policy is and who
initiates what paperwork to upgrade shelters to other types of facilities. Sometimes this
may be solely a CE paperwork effort with services input, or it may be a combined
services, CE, contracting, and logistics readiness effort through a theater support
office.
5.12.11. Host Nation and Support and Ration Supply Guidance. Review any host nation
agreements upon arrival. At some deployed locations, there will be a joint-support plan
specifying which country provides rations for US forces. Seek host nation supply guidance
through the joint task force (JTF) logistics section (J-4), numbered air force, theater command,
or MAJCOM. The APHC must approve this procedure.
5.12.12. Expansion. As the mission increases the amount of personnel to support will
increase. Be sure to remain in contact with base CE and security forces for locations if/when
food operations need to expand. Keep the respective MAJCOM or theater service planner
aware of all communications and changes to the operation.
5.13. Subsistence Ordering (Prime Vendor). Food service personnel should identify the
sources and points of contact for rations support in-theater. Work with them to identify basic
transportation timelines, restocking schedules, possible customs problems, and any other
in-theater support for food and products. Become familiar with the DLA subsistence website
(http://www.dla.mil/) for updates on policy, information, and issues related to subsistence
operations. Determine the flow of rations from purchase to delivery and identify potential
 
 
5-16
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
obstacles. Coordinate expected delivery needs, fund cites, and order codes through the respective
MAJCOM and/or theater service planner.
5.13.1. Availability. Some food items are not available to ship due to lengthy shipment times,
limited shelf life, or not available from the contract vendor. These items generate a
not-in-stock (NIS) designation on the item order. There also may be substitutions that were not
planned or wanted. Expect some problems during initial support from new food-support
contractors. Work any problems and issues through the Theater Services Planners and with
AFSVC/VMFA support as required.
5.13.2. Local Purchase and Other Options. Determine if the theater allows local purchase
(from approved available sources). Contact APHC for approval. Use this method to cover
those items that are not readily available or deliverable through DLA.
5.13.2.1. At some deployed locations, there will be a joint-support plan specifying which
country provides rations for US forces. Every attempt should be made to obtain rations
from the US.
5.13.2.2. When the host nation provides rations, remember some eating habits are
different from American habits. For example, in some countries fish is served for breakfast
and in other countries cold cuts may be the only entrée for dinner. Primary meats may be
lamb, mutton, or goat. In those instances, work closely with the liaison officer to obtain
fresh or frozen, beef and pork for US forces. Regardless of the type of food obtained from
a host nation, it must be approved by APHC.
5.13.3. Protection. Subsistence (including bottled water) protection from terrorist or hostile
forces is now recognized as a crucial area for food service operations. The food and water
(F&W) life cycle is an area of increasing threat to the health of Air Force personnel and will
receive more aggressive force protection consideration by security forces, CE, services,
medical group (public health [bioenvironmental engineers]), and supply point managers (e.g.,
contracting and ELRS). When planning a warehouse complex, always consider the combined
food and bottled water requirements for storage and distribution. F&W storage should be
collocated in the same warehousing complex for better security and oversight, as well as for
managing the total covered area needed for dry storage.
5.13.4. Meal Determinations. During sustainment, one of the primary efforts is to determine
the total number of meals to be served. Determine the anticipated surge figures during force
rotation overlaps, as well as any holidays covered by the ordering period. Both may require
additional rations to be ordered and require a plan for the additional subsistence warehouse
storage requirement. Menu planning and subsistence ordering are now based on meal
preparations to serve 100 percent of the base population. This includes figures obtained from
the PERSCO team as adjusted for head count, locally developed feeding data, and considering
any alternate food service opportunities (e.g., franchised food vendors for pizza, hamburgers,
fried chicken) that are contracted by services or AAFES.
5.13.5. Potable Water. When potable water is not available, DFACs use bottled water for
cooking. There are multiple size containers and container-dispensers. Avoid using the
convenience size (personal use) water bottles and obtain water in at least 5-gallon jugs. If there
are water stands to hold larger containers, obtain 10- to 20-gallon jugs that have spigots for

filling smaller items. These can be much heavier (about 85 and 165 pounds respectively) and
can be more costly to purchase.
5.14. Accounting. Accounting is completed on a daily basis. In addition, a monthly and
end-of-deployment report is required. Before departing home station, food managers should order
an initial set of AF Form 79 accompanied by the AF Form 1254, Register of Cash Collection
Sheets.
5.14.1. Procedures. All accounting is done on a daily basis. This means all signatures,
purchase invoices, transfer and inventory forms are compiled for end of month reports.
5.14.1.1. Control the issue of AF Forms 79 on AF Form 1254.
5.14.1.2. Account for and record all meals provided by utilizing the AF Form 79
(headcount of essential station messing [ESM] personnel and signatures of cash
collections).
5.14.1.3. At the end of each day, the food manager will tally the head count total by
category and annotate it within the AF Form 1119-1 on the AF Form 1650b daily tab. At
locations without computer capabilities, managers will use the manual AF Form 1650b.
The head counts and earned income figures from the manual AF Form 1650b are
transferred to electronic AF Form 1119-1.
5.14.1.4. Ensure to use the current months AF Form 1119-1 provided by the MAJCOM or
theater service planner when conducting field accounting.
5.14.1.5. Inventory of all rations should be conducted and documented weekly and
end-of-month on the AF Form 1650b.
5.14.1.6. Enter the value of purchases, transfers, inventory value on the AF Form 1119-1.
5.14.1.7. Remember net issues are the value of the food that is missing (take the starting
inventory value, add what is purchased, add or subtract what is transferred, and subtract
the ending inventory value, this will provide snapshot of gain/loss for the operation).
Efforts to control waste with meal planning and storeroom controls should be taken to
avoid excessive losses. The electronic AF Form 1119-1 will be distributed monthly from
AFSVC to the respective MAJCOM or theater service planners. This form can also be
found on the AFSVC portal page (https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/10042).
5.14.2. Authorized Customers, Foreign Nationals, and Contractors. Under 
field
conditions, several different customers who normally are not authorized to utilize the dining
facility may be fed. All US enlisted, officers, and civilians assigned to the contingency
operation (regardless of branch of service) are authorized to eat in the field dining facility. The
site commander will determine if foreign military personnel are authorized to eat in the
facility. If foreign military are authorized to eat in the facility, ensure to account for them on a
separate AF Form 79. Contractors that are assigned to the contingency operation will have a
contract that states how members pay for their meals. Regardless of what their contract states,
account for the contractors separately (via AF Form 79) and submit reports to the contract
POC for meals to be paid. In preparing for Joint Asset Movement Management System
(JAMMS)/Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) install, work with
the local finance, contracting, and security forces units to improve on meal accountability

processes. Contact local CPTS or Theater service planners to determine cash handling
capabilities.
5.14.3. Meal Allowances. AFSVC/SVOF publishes the meal allowances for all rations for
the calendar year on the DOD Meal Rate Policy Letter. This letter is published on the Air
Force food and beverage page. If MREs are offered, they are sold at the rate based upon the
meal period served. If UGRs and/or A-rations are provided, utilize the field meal allowance
identified on the AF Form 1119-1. Contact the MAJCOM or theater service planner and
AFSVC/SVOF for the current months AF Form 1119-1.
5.15. Lessons Learned. Actions are taken to address many issues and problems at a deployed
location. Some lessons cannot be corrected by a headquarters or operating agency. They can only
be addressed by making EFSS commanders and services personnel aware that a situation may
occur and let them plan to address it as necessary. Lessons learned assist AFSVC, supporting
major commands, and deployed personnel in planning for possible scenarios with appropriate
tools and actions.
5.15.1. Continuity and Planning. EFSS commanders should ensure that continuity is
maintained between rotations by ensuring continuity folders are developed and maintained.
Plan operations for continuous support and to setup follow-on forces for success. Simply put,
there cannot be a seamless rotation turnover if there are not operational plans ready to turn
over.
5.15.2. Continuity of Operations. It is important to document almost every budget and
planning effort, including recommendations and lessons learned for all the major services
support areas. AARs submitted from recent operations indicate that there continues to be
serious disconnects between the various rotations. Provide well-documented summaries of
plans, budgets, and personnel requirements. Pass on information of equipment and supplies
that have already been ordered, but not yet received, to include expected delivery dates.
Include pertinent information on why items were purchased and where they will be utilized.
Be prepared to provide food service inputs to important reports on the frequency determined
by the senior services representative.
5.15.3. WRM. When an operating location will be populated for longer than six months,
services managers should look at replacing and turning in WRM shelters and equipment.
Replace WRM equipment as necessary for age or condition, when needed to support other
deployment efforts, when no longer economically fit for use, when more efficient commercial
systems become available, and when QoL enhancements are desired by leadership. Theater
managers should provide direction on what to return and how to return it during the
sustainment phase. In addition to base directed efforts, theaters will normally have central
contracts to reconstitute and return equipment. Work with theater planners as well as base
logistics readiness to determine what WRM needs to be returned. Plan with CE to obtain more
permanent shelters or facilities and obtain equipment either separately or as a part of an
installed package. Document all actions in continuity files to provide follow-on rotations with
information on what WRM equipment will be turned-in and what budget programs will be
used to replace the WRM resources.

Chapter 6
CH6 CASUALTY REPORTING
CASUALTY REPORTING
6.1. Overview. In a deployed environment, the PERSCO team is responsible for casualty
reporting of personnel assigned to their location and GSU personnel. Casualties affect the total
accountability of personnel available for service. Casualty is reported as hostile or non-hostile
based on the situation and can be broken down into six casualty statuses that will be discussed
later in the chapter. PERSCO should report casualties in a timely manner to ensure notification is
completed within 24 hours of reported status. Defense Casualty Information Processing System
(DCIPS) is used to report all casualty information and produce casualty reports for Air Force
Personnel Casualty Services Branch.
6.2. Roles and Responsibilities. PERSCO has a key role with mandatory requirements in
ensuring the casualty reporting process is accomplished in a timely manner. It is essential that
PERSCO establish and maintain close communication on reportable casualties with deployed
medical treatment facility (MTF) and mortuary affairs offices.
6.2.1. PERSCO Team Chief. The PERSCO Team chief will identify team members who
perform casualty processing actions. Team members may also be identified via ULN line
remark. The PERSCO Team chief or NCOIC should ensure on-site commanders, PERSCO
Team personnel, and base/employment site support offices fully understand their
responsibilities to the casualty program. According to DAFI 36-3002, Casualty Services,
PERSCO Teams must develop instructions to promptly report casualties and submit casualty
reports through the DCIPS Forward.
NOTE: All casualty reports must be submitted through DCIPS Forward and all reports are
exempt from MINIMIZE.
6.2.2. PERSCO DCIPS Representative. DCIPS representatives should apply for DCIPS
access via the Air Force Personnel Center, Casualty Services Branch (AFPC/DPFCS)
SharePoint® site no earlier than 30 days prior to deployment. Immediately upon learning of a
casualty or an incident that may or may not have casualties but is newsworthy, the PERSCO
Team chief or NCOIC should contact Air Force Personnel Center Casualty Services Branch
for assistance and guidance. The DCIPS representative should complete a casualty report
within four hours. Upon notification of transfer, the losing DCIPS representative should
relinquish casualty processing once member has been transferred and ensure necessary
DCAPES actions are completed. The gaining DCIPS representative should receive incoming
personnel transferred to the medical treatment facility (MTF) and ensure DCAPES is updated
accordingly.
6.2.3. Deployed MTF/Civilian MTF. The MTF should designate a liaison with the PERSCO
DCIPS representative to provide information on casualty status in a timely manner. Deployed
MTF liaison should ensure all personnel receiving casualty information complete Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) release documentation and maintain
signed documentation at MTF.
6.2.4. Mortuary Affairs. Mortuary affairs should work with PERSCO casualty
representative on all cases involving deceased personnel. Coordination with PERSCO,
commanders, First Sergeants, component A1, and home station will be handled by mortuary
affairs representative.
 
 
6-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
6.2.5. Home Station IPR. IPR tracks casualties in DCAPES to ensure member duty status is
reported accordingly. Coordinate with casualty assistance representative (CAR) to ensure
DCAPES is updated upon completion of casualty status.
6.2.6. Home Station CAR. The CAR will notify commander and unit of personnel reported
as casualties and continue to monitor each case until the member is returned to home station.
The CAR is responsible for the final casualty message.
6.2.7. PERSCO. Upon notification of a casualty, the PERSCO casualty representative should
determine required actions based on type of casualty. Not all casualties will be transferred to
another MTF but still require action by DCAPES operator and DCIPS representative. A
template of required information should be created upon arrival at deployed location.
6.2.7.1. Upon notification from MTF of a casualty, the PERSCO casualty representative
collects required information to include in casualty report. PERSCO and the MTF liaison
should establish procedures to distribute this information.
6.2.7.2. PERSCO casualty representative logs into AFPC Secure, Deployed Virtual
Military Personnel Flight (dVMPF) and retrieve a copy of members DD Form 93,
Emergency Data Card for inclusion with the casualty report. The casualty representative
retrieves a single unit retrieval file (SURF) from dVMPF with the member’s personnel
data.
6.2.7.2.1. DCAPES operator provides deployed unit of assignment information as
required.
6.2.7.2.2. DCAPES operator updates appropriate duty status and forward deploy
member DCAPES record to applicable MTF as required.
6.2.7.2.3. Reporting Process. See Table 6.1, Casualty Reporting Process for the
casualty reporting steps required by the PERSCO Team.

seriously ill or injured (VSI), seriously ill or injured (SI), 
or not seriously ill or injured (NSI).
Deceased
A casualty status applicable to a person who is either 
known to have died, determined to have died based on 
conclusive evidence, or declared to be dead on the basis 
of a presumptive finding of death. The recovery of 
remains is not a prerequisite to determining or declaring 
a person deceased
Duty Status—Whereabouts Unknown

suspects the member may be a casualty whose absence is 
involuntary but does not feel sufficient evidence 
currently exists to make a definite determination of 
missing or deceased.
Missing
A casualty status for which Title 37, USC, Pay and 
Allowances of the Uniformed Services, Chapter 10, 
Payments to Missing Persons provides statutory 
guidance concerning missing members of the Military 
Services, and Title 5, USC, Government Organization 
and Employees, Chapter 7 provides statutory guidance 
concerning missing civilians. Excluded are personnel 
who are in an absent without leave, deserter, or 
dropped-from-rolls status. 
Beleaguered
The casualty is a member of an organized element that 
has been surrounded by a hostile force to prevent escape 
of its members.
Besieged
The casualty is a member of an organized element that 
has been surrounded by a hostile force for compelling it 
to surrender.
Captured
The casualty has been seized as the result of action of an 
unfriendly military or paramilitary force in a foreign 
country.

6.3.2. Casualty Type. Used to identify a casualty for reporting purposes as either a hostile
casualty or a non-hostile casualty.
6.3.2.1. Hostile Casualty. A person who is the victim of a terrorist activity or who
becomes a casualty in action. In action characterizes the casualty as having been the direct
result of hostile action, sustained in combat or relating thereto, or sustained going to or
returning from a combat mission provided that the occurrence was directly related to
hostile action.
6.3.2.1.1. Included are persons killed or wounded mistakenly or accidentally by
friendly fire directed at a hostile force or what is thought to be a hostile force.
However, not to be considered as sustained in action and not to be interpreted as hostile
casualties are injuries or death due to the elements, self-inflicted wounds, combat
fatigue, and except in unusual cases, wounds or death inflicted by a friendly force
while the individual is in an absent without leave (AWOL), deserter, or
dropped-from-rolls status or is voluntarily absent without authority from a place of
duty.
6.3.2.1.2. Killed in Action (KIA). A casualty category applicable to a hostile casualty,
other than the victim of a terrorist activity, who is killed outright or who dies as a result
of wounds or other injuries before reaching a medical treatment facility
6.3.2.1.3. Wounded in Action. A casualty category applicable to a hostile casualty,
other than the victim of a terrorist activity, who has incurred an injury due to an
external agent or cause. The term encompasses all kinds of wounds and other injuries
Interned
The casualty is definitely known to have been taken into 
custody of a nonbelligerent foreign power as the result of 
and for reasons arising out of any armed conflict in 
which the Armed Forces of the United States are 
engaged.
Missing in Action (MIA)
The casualty is a hostile casualty, other than the victim of 
a terrorist activity, who is not present at his or her duty 
location due to apparent involuntary reasons and whose 
location is unknown.
Not Seriously Ill or Injured (NSI)
The casualty status of a person whose illness or injury 
requires medical attention, may or may not require 
hospitalization, and medical authority classifies as less 
severe than SI.
Seriously Ill or Injured (SI)
The casualty status of a person whose illness or injury 
requires medical attention, and medical authority 
declares that death is possible, but not likely within 72 
hours, and/or the severity is such that it is permanent and 
life-altering.
Very Seriously Ill or Injured (VSI)
The casualty status of a person whose illness or injury is 
such that medical authority declares it more likely than 
not that death will occur within 72 hours.

incurred in action, whether there is a piercing of the body, as in a penetration or
perforated wound, or none, as in the contused wound. These include fractures, burns,
blast concussions, all effects of biological and chemical warfare agents, and the effects
of an exposure to ionizing radiation or any other destructive weapon or agent. The
hostile casualty’s status may be very seriously ill or injured, seriously ill or injured, or
not seriously ill or injured.
6.3.3. DCIPS. All casualty reports are submitted using the DCIPS case reporting (CR) also
known as DCIPS-CR is used to submit initial, supplemental, medical progress, and final
reports.
NOTE: PERSCO team members should immediately contact the Air Force Personnel Center
Casualty Services upon learning of a casualty. Casualty guidance can be found in DAFI 36-3002
and DCIPS training guide.
6.3.3.1. DCIPS Access and Training. Potential PERSCO Team members request
DCIPS-CR access by uploading DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request
(SAAR) to the DCIPS site. Form should include the unit address the member will be
deployed to. Request DCIPS access no earlier than 30 days prior to deployment. PERSCO
team member can request casualty assistance training from the local CAR. Refer to the
DCIPS site for training and account creation: https://dcse.hrc.army.mil/.
6.3.3.2. DCIPS has four sites for access listed below for reporting:
• DCIPS A—https://dcsa.hrc.army.mil/
• DCIPS B—https://dcsb.hrc.army.mil/
• DCIPS C—https://dcsc.hrc.army.mil/
• DCIPS D—https://dcsd.hrc.army.mil/
6.3.3.3. DCIPS and Missions Partners. Before completing a DCIPS report, the PERSCO
team member should coordinate closely with the medical community. The attending
physician is the one who places a Service member in a casualty status (e.g., very seriously
ill or injured [VSI], seriously ill or injured [SI], not seriously ill or injured [NSI]).
NOTE: Unit commanders must have conclusive evidence before declaring a member deceased.
The commander also has the responsibility to declare the member missing or DUSTWUN.
6.3.4. Timeline. PERSCO should transmits the appropriate casualty message, as determined
by AFPC/DPFCS, within four hours of learning of a casualty. If circumstances delay or
prevent the transmission within four hours, immediately contact AFPC/DPFCS for guidance.
NOTE: Always contact AFPC/DPFCS immediately upon learning of a casualty.
6.3.4.1. Medical Progress Reports (MPR). CARs and PERSCO teams are required to
provide a medical progress report (using DCIPS-CR) within 24 hours of the initial event
report and every 14 days thereafter if SI or VSI until upgraded to NSI or member is
removed from a casualty status, retires, or separates. If the member is on NSI status and
their illness/injury originated in an imminent danger pay (IDP)/hazardous duty pay (HDP)
area and were hospitalized, a report is still required to be provided every 30 days until the
member is removed from a casualty status, retires, or separates.
 
 
6-8
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
6.3.4.2. Completing MPR. Using DCIPS-CR, enter a complete description to include:
date; treatment; medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) information; casualty status (remains
the same or changed to NSI/SI/VSI)/ if being moved to another treatment facility the name
and location of it; transfer of reporting to another CAR (contact via phone to confirm
transfer prior to providing progress report); emergency family member travel (EFMT)
updates (i.e., after-the-fact EFMT requested, next of kin [NOK] remain at bedside under
EFMT, EFMT terminated); NOK notification; and if further reports will follow or if this is
a final report.
6.3.4.3. Casualty Transfer or MEDEVAC. Submit a progress report using DCIPS-CR
upon learning of a change information (e.g., MEDEVAC, transferred to another location,
new information requiring immediate reporting). A final report is required upon separation
or retirement.
6.3.5. Case Management (CM) Bound Journal. Within DCIPS-CM, there is a place to
document all and or any relevant activity (e.g., EFMT, casualty status activity for Service
members who are missing status or DUSTWUN). This type of activity and relevant
information provides continuity with case management when documented in the bound
journal within DCIPS-CM.

CH7 CONTINGENCY MORTUARY AFFAIRS
CONTINGENCY MORTUARY AFFAIRS
7.1. Overview. The goal of the mortuary affairs program during contingency operations is to
ensure remains return to CONUS as quickly as possible, to preserve remains for identification,
and preservation of evidence of death. Remains returned to the Air Force Mortuary Affairs
Operations/Port Mortuary (AFMAO/PM) (located at Dover AFB) undergo identification
processing, personal effects inventory, preparation, casketing, and final disposition. Refer to
Department of the Air Force Handbook (DAFH) 3-102, Guide to Services Contingency Planning:
Mortuary Affairs Search and Recovery, DAFI 34-160, Mortuary Affairs Program, and Air Force
tactics, techniques, and procedures (AFTTP) 3-2.51, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Theaters of Operations.
7.2. Responsibilities. The mortuary affairs program in a contingency environment provides
support across the full spectrum of military operations to include:
• Search and recovery.
• Tentative believed to be (BTB) identification.
• Evacuation of remains.
• Temporary refrigerated storage, interment, or disinterment (when required).
• Return deceased military, civilian and allied personnel, interned enemy aliens and enemy
dead.
• Establishment and operation of mortuary affairs collection points (MACP), theater mortuary
evacuation points (TMEP), military mortuaries, and interment sites.
• Collection, inventory, storage, and processing of personal effects (PE) of all deceased and
missing US and adversary personnel.
• Operation of the port mortuary.
• Preparation and coordination of the shipment of remains for final disposition.
• Response to mass fatality incidents.
7.3. Mortuary Support for Other Categories of Personnel.
7.3.1. Dependents and US Civilians. Dependents and US civilians accompanying or
employed by US forces will be processed in a manner similar to US military personnel. All
records and procedures are the same as required for military members.
7.3.2. Allied, Interned Enemy Aliens, and Enemy Deceased. Use existing standardization
agreements whenever possible. If agreements do not exist and the US is the lead nation, US
policy should have precedence. If agreements do not exist and another nation is the lead, US
policy would apply only to US forces and citizens, unless otherwise adopted by the
multinational force. Under these circumstances, use the same records and reports as for US
military. Interment, if required, will be separate for allied and enemy dead. PE of allied
personnel will be processed in accordance with standing agreements or according to current
mortuary affairs procedures if no agreements exist.
7.3.3. Prisoners of War (POW). Process POWs in accordance with the Geneva
Conventions. Contact the Theater Mortuary Affairs Office (TMAO) for more guidance.
 
 
7-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
7.3.4. Transfer of Remains to Host Country. When arrangements are made for transferring
remains and personal effects to the host country or to an allied nation, mortuary officers will
document the transfer in the mortuary officer log of events. The mortuary officer should also
provide information for all enemy, detainees, or allied deceased transferred from temporary
interment sites for which they have responsibility to the TMAO or joint mortuary affairs office
(JMAO).
7.4. Contingency Mortuary Flow of Remains Concept. Areas covered in this section are the
casualty collection point (CCP), MACP, TMEP, aerial port, and port mortuary. See Figure 7.1,
Contingency Flow of Human Remains.
Figure 7.1. Contingency Flow of Human Remains
7.4.1. Casualty Collection Point (CCP). The CCP will normally be located near a medical
facility and managed by medical personnel. An EFSS representative should coordinate with
the CCP to begin actions to receive remains. Mortuary personnel are responsible for
transporting remains from the CCPs only. The obviously dead may also be transported directly
to the MACP. However, it is the responsibility of the decedent’s unit, through the buddy care
process to transport remains to either the MACP or CCP. See Figure 7.2, CCP Example.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-3
 
 
Figure 7.2. CCP Example
7.4.1.1. At the CCP, a competent medical authority is required to declare death. Record
declaration of death on appropriate medical form or tag. Write the word draft on the death
certificate, DD Form 2064, Certificate of Death (Overseas).
7.4.1.2. Search and report remains suspected to have unexploded explosive ordnance
(UXO) to the civil engineer representative in the EOC via the UCC.
7.4.1.3. While waiting for air transportation, mortuary personnel should ensure remains
are stored in a respectful manner, laid shoulder to shoulder in an environmentally
controlled facility or container at a temperature between 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit
(when possible) and screened to prevent them from public view. Mortuary personnel
should coordinate with security forces, if needed, to assist in preventing the theft of PE and
equipment and to keep unauthorized personnel away from the area.
7.4.1.4. Vehicle operations should provide EFSS mortuary personnel with a covered
vehicle to transport remains from the CCP to the MACP.
7.4.1.5. During instances where remains arrive directly at the MACP, call a competent
medical authority to pronounce death. Physicians in the field should provide information
on cause of death, if known (e.g., gunshot, blunt trauma). Final determination as to
positive identification of remains and the cause and manner of death rests with the Armed
Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES).
7.4.2. Mortuary Affairs Collection Points (MACP). The main purpose of the MACP is to
move remains, along with accompanying PE, to the AFMAO/PM as quickly as possible for
processing and identification (i.e., bag, tag, encase and ship). See Figure 7.3, MACP
Example.
 
 
7-4
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Figure 7.3. MACP Example (Niamey)
7.4.2.1. Site Selection. Physically separate the MACP from the main living and work
areas on high, dry ground with good drainage. It should be upwind of, and as far away
from, the dining facility as possible. Consider the site’s proximity to the runway or airport,
medical and personnel services, and tactical communications support. There should also
be access to an existing helipad or the availability to build a helipad. The MACP should
have natural or artificial cover (e.g., trees, hills, unused ISO containers) and screened from
view. There should be an access road for vehicles. Sufficient space should be made for
processing and holding areas. Establish a perimeter to prevent unauthorized personnel and
news media from entering the area. If there’s a possibility that remains may contain UXOs,
provide sandbag revetments for emergency areas of protection and for general blast
protection.
7.4.2.2. MACP Requirements. The MACP requires at least six total personnel to operate:
1 x MACP NCOIC, 1 x team lead, and 4 x mortuary affairs team members. All personnel
require a pre-exposure briefing conducted by mental health before handling remains as
well as a post-exposure briefing upon completion of their tour. MACP personnel will
require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as advised by Operational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.
7.4.2.2.1. Members handling remains require immediate access to shower and laundry
facilities.
7.4.2.2.2. Most field mortuary operations use a Small Shelter System to support
MACP operations.
7.4.2.2.3. The site will also require a 275 cubic foot refrigerator large enough to store
remains.
7.4.2.2.4. The site may require a power generator if normal site power is not available
during processing.
7.4.2.2.5. The MACP will also require adequate lighting, a water supply, access for
truck and forklift operations, good drainage and runoff protection, and ventilation.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-5
 
 
7.4.2.2.6. Depending upon the location and temperatures, an ECU may be required
during processing.
7.4.2.2.7. A bio-hazard waste collection point may also be required.
7.4.2.2.8. Initial supplies are contained in the RFSER UTC package. These supplies
are for initial operations and additional materials may need to be acquire through
contracting or WRM.
7.4.2.3. MACP Layout. If possible, establish separate areas for receiving, processing, and
evacuation to avoid confusion. See Figure 7.4, Mortuary Affairs Collection Point
Operational Layout for a sample layout of a MACP. Refer to  AFTTP 3-2.51, for additional
detailed information on facility layout.
Figure 7.4. Mortuary Affairs Collection Point Operational Layout
7.4.2.4. MACP Planning for Bio-Defense. Because of the increased terrorist threat of
biological warfare, planning for the operation of a MACP in a biological environment
must be considered as part of the base bio-defense plan. Use of mission oriented protective
posture (MOPP) equipment meets personnel safety requirements until specific bio-defense
protective equipment and gear has been developed and fielded.
7.4.2.5. MACP Personnel Responsibilities. Mortuary personnel collect and preserve
identification information, operate the MACP, and prepare the remains for shipment.
Recovery of remains to either CCP or MACP will be accomplished through the medical
evacuation system or the buddy care system. If remains are delivered to the CCP instead of
the MACP, it is the responsibility of the MACP or the mortuary CCP augmentees to collect
 
 
7-6
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
remains from the CCP and transport them to the MACP. If the Mortuary Affairs Remains
Tracking System (MARTS) is available, Air Force personnel operating or supporting a
MACP should be trained to use the system. MACP personnel should upload all known
information of each deceased into MARTS. MARTS is web based automated program that
will assist in the elimination of common errors and redundancy that could result from the
preparation of paper forms.
7.4.2.6. MACP Human Remains Processing. For MACP processing procedures, please
refer to  AFTTP 3-2.51.
7.4.2.7. Shipment/Icing. When remains are ready to ship and a transfer case is available,
place the human remains pouch in the transfer case and begin icing procedures.
7.4.2.7.1. Follow AFMES icing procedures listed in Figure 7.5, Re-Icing Diagram.
Generally, place ice in plastic bags to collect water as ice melts, double or triple bag the
ice when possible. If ice machines are not available, other plastic-type waterproof
container/material (frozen water bottles) may be used to freeze water. The correct
placement of ice in the human remains transfer case (HRTC) should include the use of
six to nine bags of ice (8 to 10 pounds each), 60 to 90 pounds of crushed wet ice bags,
and place ice bags in the following locations:
• Head: Two bags, one on each side of the head (do not place over face).
• Chest: Three bags; one on each side of the torso (oblique) and one over chest.
• Lower Extremities: Three bags, one on each side of lower extremities, one over
groin area.
• Feet: One bag under the feet. See Figure 7.5 for ice placement.

Figure 7.5. Re-Icing Diagram
NOTES:
1. When icing single portions of fragmented remains; place ice on each side 
of the fragment (outside the HRP) and secure to prevent movement during 
shipment.
2. Amount of ice varies upon location. Desert locations will require more ice 
due to high temperatures.
3. Mortuary Affairs Collection Point (MACP) personnel will ensure transfer 
cases are draped with a flag from the area of responsibility to the Port 
Mortuary, if the deceased are United States (US) personnel.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
7.4.2.7.2. Record the shipment information (date, shipped to) on the DD Form 1077,
Collection Point Register of Deceased. Record the shipment on DD Form 1075,
Convoy List of Remains of Deceased Personnel. The aircraft commander or vehicle
driver must sign for the remains on the DD Form 1075. Multiple copies of DD Form
1075 are required, at least 2.
7.4.2.7.3. Contact EFSS UCC to coordinate transportation and shipment to the TMEP
or port mortuary.
7.4.2.7.4. Contact the nearest Personnel Support for PERSCO team to aid in casualty
reporting. Provide the BTB name, grade, social security number (SSN), and
organization of each of the deceased individuals.
7.4.2.7.5. Notify AFMAO by immediate precedence message. Upon evacuation,
provide AFMAO with the shipment date, destination, and a list of remains by name,
grade, SSN, and organization.
7.4.2.7.6. Transport the remains. Carry remains feet first at all times. While loading
remains, maintain an attitude of reverence and respect. Remains will be loaded feet
first into vehicles. When loading remains on an aircraft, they will be loaded feet first
then turned once inside. The head will always be stowed toward the nose of the
aircraft. This assures aircraft acceleration forces are borne by the feet, thereby avoiding
damage to the head. Secure remains to prevent shifting during movement. Transfer
cases containing remains will be stowed on the aircraft/pallet in a level position. The
feet will never be higher than the head while in the stowed position. Avoid stacking
transfer cases.
7.4.2.7.7. SITREP. At the end of each day, the EFSS UCC should provide higher
headquarters a SITREP of the day’s mortuary affairs activity. Record the evacuation
numbers received and shipped on the report. Continue to report on future SITREPs
until notification that the remains have arrived at the AFMAO/PM. Remember, the
information reported is part of the main SITREP, submitted by the commander.
NOTE: If the aircraft is departing within two hours or before remains can be processed, MACP
personnel will ship remains without processing. The minimum procedures that must be
accomplished are: complete DD Form 1077, prepare two evacuation tags, and remove any
weapons, ammunition, or classified material.
7.4.3. TMEP. TMEPs are established to evacuate all remains and accompanying PE to a
government mortuary (e.g., Kuwait City International Airport). TMEP personnel:
7.4.3.1. Receive remains from the theater location (and accompanying PE, clothing, and
gear) and record remains on DD Form 1077. Remains will be offloaded feet first.
7.4.3.2. Perform quality assurance checks on existing documentation or initiate, complete,
and obtain required processing documentation.
7.4.3.3. Prepare remains for evacuation and perform re-icing procedures as necessary.
7.4.3.4. If a deceased US personnel’s transfer case has not been flag draped, a TMEP
member will ensure the flag is draped appropriately. Do not secure flags to transfer cases
that must be stacked.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-9
 
 
7.4.3.5. Arrange airlift and initiate all required shipping and special handling documents
7.4.3.6. Record shipment on DD Form 1075.
7.4.3.7. Transport transfer cases to the Air Mobility Command (AMC) special handling
area for palletizing.
7.4.3.8. When transfer cases contain human remains, no cargo should be loaded on top of
them. Ensure transfer cases are tied down with no more than three transfer cases per pallet.
Avoid stacking of transfer cases.
7.4.3.9. Empty transfer cases are permitted to be stacked three per row and a max of four
high.
7.4.3.10. SITREP (Evacuation Numbers Shipped).
7.4.3.11. If remains arrive at the TMEP and have not been loaded into MARTS, TMEP
personnel will ensure this is accomplished before the remains are transferred from the
TMEP.
7.4.4. Aerial Staging Facility (Force Support Augmentation). (e.g., Ramstein AB). Aerial
ports:
7.4.4.1. Receive remains from the TMEP, record them on a DD Form 1077 and re-ice
remains for shipment, if practical.
7.4.4.2. Remains will be shipped to Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE.
7.4.4.3. Shipment will be recorded on DD Form 1075 and evacuation numbers will be
documented in the SITREP.
NOTE: Not all flights flow through the aerial staging facility. Remains may be shipped directly to
AFMAO Port Mortuary.
7.4.5. AFMES Responsibilities. AFMES is managed by the Defense Health Agency and is
colocated directly beside AFMAO at Dover AFB. Immediately upon arrival to Dover AFB,
AFMES immediately takes possession of and accountability for the fallen Service members
killed-in-action. They are responsible for the positive identification of remains and to perform
autopsy to determine cause of death. Once complete, they transfer custody of remains to
AFMAO for embalming, preparation, casketing, and transportation.
7.4.6. AFMAO Responsibilities. AFMAO is the designated port-of-entry mortuary facility.
It handles most human remains from OCONUS to include wartime fatalities. It is responsible
to prepare and casket human remains. AFMAO complies with disposition instructions and
transports the fallen member to their final resting place designated from the Person Authorized
Direct Disposition (PADD). AFMAO has UTCs specifically postured to support operations at
the port mortuary. Force Support Contingency Training-Mortuary (FSCT-M), which is
specific training for the tasks performed at the port mortuary is mandatory for Reserve
members and highly recommended for Active Duty members assigned to an AFMAO UTC.
7.4.7. Joint Personal Effects Depot (JPED). The JPED is managed by the Army but resides
at Dover AFB adjacent to AFMAO to increase unity of effort. The JPED is responsible for
receiving, safeguarding, inventorying, storing, and determining the final disposition of
 
 
7-10
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
personal effects of not only those killed-in-action, but also those who are wounded or missing
from all branches of military service.
7.5. Search and Recovery (S&R) Operations. S&R capabilities are primarily built when
sustainment operations begin, but EFSS personnel should train to provide at least an initial
capability of 11 core force support personnel for S&R during the Establish the Airbase phase of
beddown. Initial supplies are contained in the RFSER UTC package. These supplies are for initial
operations and additional materials may need to be acquired through contracting or WRM.
Historically, preparations were based on responses to mishaps that involved military personnel
and military aircraft. However, deaths caused by other fatal occurrences such as ground
transportation mishaps, fires, enemy/terrorist attacks (Khobar Towers and Pentagon), or natural
disasters could require S&R. EFSS leaders and planners should ensure deployment teams train
and prepare for a wide range of S&R situations, not just steady state aircraft mishaps. Handle
response to these events with procedures similar to those involving aircraft. Planners develop base
and unit plans that define the roles of responding members. Be aware that wing plans for disaster
responses cover many aspects of S&R operation employment.
7.5.1. Contingency Location S&R. While the Army is the lead agent for S&R in the theater
of operations, beddown locations with Air Force BOS responsibility will be required to
conduct S&R in support of incidents on or near their installation for minor incidents with five
or less fatalities. Prior to any S&R operations, the mortuary officer should contact the
component headquarters services staff. The component headquarters staff will coordinate with
the US Army mortuary affairs executive agent to determine who will conduct the S&R. When
it is determined that Air Force personnel will conduct S&R operations, the following policy
applies:
7.5.1.1. S&R will only be conducted under conditions that do not endanger the S&R team.
Under hostile conditions, the installation or incident commander will determine when it is
safe to begin S&R operations. Under non-hostile conditions, explosive ordnance disposal
(EOD), CBRN (USA and United States Marine Corps [USMC]), fire emergency services,
emergency management (EM), and security force personnel determine if and when the
area is safe to conduct S&R operations.
7.5.1.2. In a contaminated environment, limit S&R operations to the minimum processes
required to remove remains from the field. Personnel must wear the appropriate protective
gear required for the operation. Treat all remains as contaminated. Consult CE readiness
personnel and follow appropriate personal decontamination procedures at the conclusion
of S&R operations.
7.5.1.3. Force support personnel should manage S&R operations and work through
installation leadership to task members of other organizations as augmentees.
7.5.2. Search Method. Use the search method that applies best to the location, time available,
and conditions for searching. The type of terrain, scatter of wreckage and remains, and
possibility of hostilities will determine the best possible and feasible method for S&R. The
success of an S&R mission depends on a well-organized search pattern that fits the particular
situation. The S&R team should move in the direction of the recovery site in a slow and steady
pattern, searching side-to-side for items pertaining to the operation. Team members should
ensure their search technique adapts with surrounding vegetation and terrain. If bushes and
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-11
 
 
shrubs are present, do a thorough search inside and around the bush for remains and PE. If
there are trees in the search area, members need to ensure the branches are checked due to the
possibility of remains/PE becoming entangled above the ground. The team leader should
ensure that the team maintains proper intervals, moves in the direction of the recovery site, and
always stays online. See Figure 7.6, Example of a Straight-Line Box Search.
Figure 7.6. Example of a Straight-Line Box Search
7.5.3. Normal Recovery. Recovery is time sensitive and is the most important and
demanding phase of the field operation. Valuable investigative information, identification of
remains, and mishap clues can easily be destroyed by hasty or incomplete recovery actions.
The mortuary officer should work closely with the director of base medical services or the
interim safety board (ISB)/safety investigation board (SIB) medical officer to ensure remains
are properly examined, staked, tagged, photographed, and plotted using Global Positioning
System (GPS) before removal. When GPS is not available, hand-drawn maps or sketches
should be used.
7.5.3.1. Preserving Evidence. Units conducting recovery operations in the AOR should
take special precautions to preserve all items that might be useful in establishing a
tentative identification of remains. When performing recovery operations, use any means
available to recover all remains and portions of remains. PE should not be removed from
remains at the mishap site. This will include official cards (line badge) and papers, name
tags, and accoutrements. These items will be left on or with the remains to preserve
identification evidence. Only weapons, ordnance, and classified material will be removed
from the remains. Coordinate with security force and EOD personnel for removal.
 
 
7-12
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
7.5.3.2. The mortuary officer should coordinate with bioenvironmental engineering (BE)
and CE to determine PPE for S&R.
7.5.3.3. The mortuary officer should coordinate with CE to determine if a GPS capability
exists to plot remains and personal effects locations.
7.5.3.4. If normal recovery is possible, use the tagging and bagging process. Use
permanent markers to mark flags; use R-# designation for intact remains (constitutes more
than 50 percent of a human body, the torso for example), P-# designation for portions of
remains, and E-# designation for PE. Each letter will be followed by sequential numbering
(e.g., R-1, P-1, P-2) using consecutive recovery numbers for each stake.
7.5.3.5. When possible, mark all PE with consecutive E-numbers. If survey-grade GPS is
available, plot the location of remains and PE. Annotate GPS coordinates and R, P, and E
#s on both remains and PE tags. If GPS is not available, use hand drawn maps or sketches
to plot the location of remains and PE.
7.5.3.6. Three tags will be used for each remains (or portion thereof) and PE found. GPS
coordinate must be written on all tags (if no GPS capability—the R, P or E-number will be
written on both tags). One tag will be attached to the remains or PE. The second tag will be
attached to the human remains/PE bag. The third tag will be attached to the stake.
7.5.3.7. If a public affairs or a combat camera photographer is not available to take photos
and there is no investigating officer or other on scene commander to take photos, bring a
digital camera to take photos of the primary mishap site, perspective shots of the site and
primary remains (intact or primarily intact), and as many portions of remains and PE as
possible that are tagged.
7.5.3.8. Portions of remains should be placed in plastic bags and then into a human
remains pouch (HRP). Minimize handling to prevent damage. Examine the ground
beneath the remains and immediate area to assure recovery of all visible remains.
7.5.3.9. Place PE found near the remains in a plastic bag and place in the same human
remains pouch. Place all other PE into a separate HRP.
7.5.3.10. Do not attempt to re-associate personal property or accouterments found loose at
the mishap site until the remains are processed and identified. Annotate them on the site
map and place in plastic bags secured with wire tie shipping tags.
7.5.3.11. Follow standard refrigeration or icing procedures for transport and storage (34 to
40 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.1 to 4.4 degrees Celsius). Transfer cases are used OCONUS
and can be packed with ice for transport, but do not place ice directly on remains. Follow
icing procedures as outlined in Figure 7.5, Re-Icing Diagram.
7.5.3.12. EFSS commander or officer in charge (OIC) should keep the Air Force
Component forward staff informed of the status of recovery.
7.5.3.13. The EOC director directs termination of the S&R.
7.5.3.14. Evacuate remains and PE to the nearest TMEP for onward movement to a
government mortuary as soon as possible.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-13
 
 
7.5.4. Expedient S&R Situations. If the recovery must be completed expeditiously, due to
possible hostilities or unsafe conditions (e.g., weather, enemy fire), R, P, and E numbers will
not be used. These situations may require a grab and bag process.
7.5.4.1. Small teams of force support, security forces, EOD, investigating officer(s), and a
medical person (if possible) are normally required for this type of operation.
7.5.4.2. Teams will enter into the site in armored vehicles or helicopters.
7.5.4.3. Teams would have a predetermined kit of PPE that is suitable for their geographic
area. Primary wear could be standard chemical suits or a protective coverall worn if
chemical (splash or contact) or dust protection is required.
7.5.4.4. Based on the number of fatalities involved, the response kit would contain enough
HRPs (double the number of fatalities when possible) and plastic bags to recover all
primarily visible remains that can be safely obtained within the mission on-ground.
7.5.4.5. If hazardous substances exist in the search area or the remains are suspected to be
contaminated, at least two HRPs should be used to contain the set of remains during
transport back from the mishap location.
7.5.4.6. If there are limitations in transport, a single HRP may have to contain a larger
number of bagged fragmented remains.
7.5.4.7. Do not remove PE found on the remains. If PE is BTB associated with the
remains, place PE in plastic bags and then place in the same HRP as the remains.
7.5.4.8. When possible, wrap intact or primary remains in a sheet and place in the HRP
before placing the plastic bags used for smaller remains or PE.
7.5.4.9. Place all other PE into plastic bags and then place into a separate HRP.
7.5.4.10. If a photographer cannot accompany the team, bring a camera and have someone
photograph the location. Take a GPS reading for the site.
7.5.4.11. Have the pilot or vehicle operator note any reference points that may help when
returning to the location for follow-on S&R.
7.5.4.12. Photograph the major mishap items and the remains (intact and primarily intact)
in perspective to the major mishap items. If flying into the location, try and take an aerial
shot of the location during approach.
7.5.4.13. Evacuate remains and PE to the nearest MACP for processing, refrigeration, and
further evacuation to the TMEP as soon as possible.
7.5.5. Unaccounted-for Remains. In situations where other remains are still unaccounted
for, the following may be required if time and equipment are available—expand the search or
check for buried portions of remains in a crater (such as with a sifting box), scattered in the
area, or under wreckage (normal S&R operations).
7.5.5.1. Later S&R efforts may be required to recover any other un-recovered remains.
The problem with not completing all S&R efforts in a contingency environment is the
potential for animal scavenging, human pilfering, or adversary intelligence gathering
(normal and expedient S&R operations).
 
 
7-14
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
7.5.6. Log of Events. A recorder at the location for all mishaps maintains a running log of
events. Each entry on the running log should include the date, time, actions that occur, actions
or support that is requested, and the person who requested the action.
7.5.6.1. For OCONUS deployments, the format for the log of events can be similar or the
same as the EFSS UCC log of events, but should be kept as a separate portion of that log if
maintained by the EFSS UCC.
7.5.6.2. Provide other information such as weather conditions, time personnel and teams
arrive or leave the site, daily team status, requests for other support or when support
arrives, all disaster mental health (DMH) and safety briefings, and all actions taken to
handle shortfalls or limiting factors.
7.5.7. Support for Non-Force Support Units Conducting S&R. Operations in a high threat
area, mission security or necessity may require units to recover the remains of their own
members (e.g., special forces, security forces, other Services). These units may request
guidance, assistance, and supplies for these operations from the nearest force support unit.
7.5.7.1. If GPS readings/coordinates and maps with identifying features of the site are
available, include them in the documentation that is shipped with remains, the case file,
and in the daily mortuary report.
7.5.7.2. Remains will receive medical confirmation, mortuary processing, and return to
the AFMAO/PM.
7.5.7.3. Ensure that remains being returned from hostile actions (to the MACP for
processing and return stateside) have been or are checked for contamination and possible
UXO before processing and placing in transfer cases.
7.5.8. Follow-up Actions and Reporting S&R. It is vitally important to use each S&R effort
as an opportunity to improve efforts. There are always lessons learned, even if there is no
formal requirement to submit a lengthy lessons learned report outside of the after action report.
7.5.8.1. The mortuary officer should submit an after action report to AFMAO through
their MAJCOM. The report will include the location, the operation start and end dates,
number of fatalities, lessons learned, and limiting factors. Submit this report no later than
30 days after recovery operations have terminated.
7.5.8.2. Additional information can be extremely useful for analysis and determining
future resources and training. When possible, also forward a copy of the log of events with
the AAR. The log of events should identify the PPE and other special equipment, vehicles,
and assistance that were used.
7.5.8.3. Findings should be discussed and updated in base and organization plans,
emergency response plans, and operating instructions (OI) to correct any shortcomings in:
• Response procedures.
• Notification efforts.
• S&R tactics, techniques, and procedures.
• Training.
• Personnel.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-15
 
 
• Transportation.
• Supplies.
• Equipment.
7.5.8.4. Updating plans and availability of resources and documenting this information is
especially important when deployed and since AFFORGEN rotations can create a lack of
continuity. Always include important efforts in a continuity folder and up-to-date OIs.
7.6. Interment, Disinterment, and Contaminated Remains Processing.
7.6.1. Emergency Interment. Emergency interment is an interment, usually on the
battlefield, when conditions do not permit either evacuation to a MACP or TMEP. It may
occur when intense hostilities prevent evacuation of remains and burial is an emergency means
of preserving remains or preventing them from falling into enemy hands. It may amount to
little more than hiding and recording the location of remains so that recovery can occur at a
safer time. It is the only situation in which interment can occur without theater commander
direction. In such case, the decision to temporarily inter can be made by the senior military
member (officer or enlisted) on scene. If so, immediately meet with civil engineers to finalize
layout and begin excavating an interment site. It is imperative to record the location of the
emergency burial so that the remains are found and disinterred as soon as possible.
7.6.2. Temporary Interment. Temporary interment is only permitted as a last resort. Every
effort should be made to evacuate remains as soon as possible. Situations that may require
temporary interment include weapons of mass destruction, hostilities, transportation
shortages, large number of remains that could overwhelm manpower capabilities, insufficient
capability to decontaminate remains, or insufficient refrigerator space. Unit commanders must
obtain permission from the geographic combatant commander (CCDR) to conduct temporary
interment operations.
7.6.3. Setup. When interment is required, establish separate interment rows for burial of
allied and enemy deceased to aid in later disinterment operations. After arrangements are
made to transfer remains to the host country or to a friendly nation, commanders will maintain
records of the transfer and provide information for all allied or enemy deceased transferred
from temporary interment sites for which they have responsibility.
7.6.4. Selection of Interment Site. The site should be level, free of large obstacles, away
from main roads and populated areas. The site should not be in a flood zone and have adequate
soil depth to the water table. Civil engineers should determine what equipment is available that
will be adequate, given types of soil and local conditions. Ensure layout is site specific and do
not try using strictly book values for spacing and depth. Civil engineers should provide enough
space between rows to prevent equipment from caving in or sliding into the trenches when
excavating and while covering the remains. They may also have to assist services personnel
for placement of row markers. At established or mature contingency beddown locations, the
temporary burial sites should be determined in advance. The primary and alternate sites for
temporary burial locations should be clearly identified using grid coordinates. The site
selection should be coordinated between CE and EFSS.
7.6.5. Interment Site Dimensions. Temporary burial sites do not contain individual graves,
but will consist of straight rows (trenches). The number of remains you have will determine
 
 
7-16
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
how many sites you will need. No more than 10 remains, head to foot lengthwise, will be
placed in each trench. The rows will be 70 feet long, 3- and one-half feet deep, and 3 feet wide.
For contaminated remains, the depth should be 6- and one-half feet and trenches should be 80
feet long. A distance of at least 3 feet between trench rows will be maintained. Ideally, rows
should be side by side, but may not be if terrain conditions prohibit.
7.6.6. Ground Preparation. The base civil engineer should provide mechanical trenching or
other earth moving equipment, with operators
Separate rows should be used for US, allied, and enemy dead.
7.6.7. Graves Registry for Temporary Interment Process. MACP personnel should meet
the personnel transporting the remains and obtain all available documentation and information
on the remains maintained in the case file. MACP complete the following procedures during
the interment process:
7.6.7.1. If a list of remains is present, verify the remains as they are offloaded. Upon
verification, mortuary personnel will sign for remains.
7.6.7.2. Initiate a DD Form 1079, Interment/Disinterment Register.
7.6.7.3. Report remains suspected to have UXO to the CE representative in the EOC via
the UCC.
7.6.7.4. Leave clothing, gear (including helmets, vests, safety equipment or organizational
equipment), and personal effects on remains to aid in identification and investigation at the
port mortuary to include the chemical warfare defense (CWD). Enter all items on the
remains, except weapons, munitions, classified documents, and hazardous material.
7.6.7.5. Assign each remain an interment processing number by using the next sequential
number from the DD Form 1079, Block 5. Use one page of DD Form 1079 for each row of
10 remains. The number consists of an accumulative number and the current calendar year
(e.g., 03-0024-2007 row 3, remains number 24, calendar year 2007).
7.6.7.6. Record information (interment processing number, date received and BTB-Name
and SSN if available) and branch of services on the DD Form 1079. Use documentation
generated at the MACP as part of the interment case file.
7.6.7.7. Place remains in a HRP. When HRPs are not available, wrap in a poncho or
plastic. Two tags will be completed (use metal tags if available), each with the interment
processing number. Attach tags as follows: one to the remains and one to the HRP.
NOTE: If remains are fragmented, attach a tag to each portion of the remains recovered. Use the
evacuation number to identify each portion of commingled remains believed to be the same
(single person death). R or P numbers, as those used in search and recovery, are not needed for
identification, they are only used in charting an accident site.
7.6.7.8. If time allows:
7.6.7.8.1. Establish tentative (BTB) identification (ID) or use unidentified.
7.6.7.8.2. Place the plastic pouch with a draft DD Form 2064 and other information in
the remains pouch. Close the remains pouch.
7.6.7.8.3. Place remains head to foot.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-17
 
 
7.6.7.8.4. Bury all personal effects with remains of US personnel.
7.6.7.8.5. Provide DD Form 1079 to the Theater Joint Mortuary Affairs Office
(JMAO). The mortuary officer will retain a copy of the DD Form 1079 in the mortuary
case file and forward a copy to AFMAO.
7.6.7.8.6. Upon burial completion in a row, the row is filled. A bucket loader-type
vehicle should be used to refill the trenches. Care should be taken not to drive over the
rows, even after they have been refilled.
7.6.8. Marking the Interment Site. Place stakes as grave markers at the beginning (head)
and end of each row. The marker should extend at least 3 feet above the ground. Attach a
weather resistant sign to the stake bearing the following information:
• Row number.
• Number of remains.
• Date of burials.
7.6.8.1. CE should provide interment site coordinates using GPS, if available. Use
coordinates to determine location of each row and record in block 4 of the DD Form 1079.
7.6.8.2. If remains are contaminated, attach a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC)
contaminated tag. Also, ensure CE emergency management clearly marks the area.
7.6.9. Disinterment. Disinter temporarily interred remains at the earliest possible time. Upon
disinterment, ship remains to AFMAO/PM. The on-scene commander is responsible for
planning the opening of trench graves to ensure accountability of remains using DD Form
1079. Use of host-nation support, local national support, or third country national support are
limited to general labor, administration, transportation, or facility support. Only US military,
United States government (USG) civilians, or DOD contracted civilians may be used to
accomplish search, recovery, and processing of US remains or inventory of personal effects.
7.6.9.1. Personnel conducting disinterment operations should wear PPE, such as N95 high
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) respirators (surgical mask may be used when respirators
are not available), gloves, and aprons.
7.6.9.2. If remains are contaminated, ensure proper MOPP gear is available to MACP
personnel during disinterment. MACP members should only assist with contaminated
remains disinterment if they have been extensively trained by the Mortuary Affairs
Contaminated Remains Mitigation Site (MACRMS) personnel. This training is more in
depth than the standard deployment CBRN requirement.
7.6.9.3. Locate the grave markers placed at the beginning of each row. Use GPS
coordinates in conjunction with maps to determine the exact location of the site.
7.6.9.4. Rows may be opened from either end. Using a backhoe and digging with care, dig
down approximately one- and one-half feet. Dig the remaining depth with hand tools to
avoid mutilating the remains. Carefully remove dirt from all sides of the remains.
7.6.9.5. Match the number on the tag to the DD Form 1079 processing number previously
recorded during interment.
7.6.9.6. If required, place the remains and HRP in a new HRP.
 
 
7-18
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
7.6.9.7. If the HRP or shroud was not intact, sift the soil in the immediate area for skeletal
anatomy and PE.
7.6.9.8. Complete the DD Form 1079 and prepare a processing tag in the same manner as
in interment operations. Attach the tag to the HRP.
7.6.9.9. Place remains and HRP on a litter and remove them from the row or interment
site.
7.6.9.10. Evacuate remains to MACP for processing and evacuation to TMEP or
AFMAO/PM.
7.6.9.11. After disinterment operations are complete, restore the land to its original
condition.
7.6.9.12. Report completed recovery efforts through command channels to the Theater
JMAO.
7.7. Contaminated Remains. This section outlines the procedures for contaminated human
remains and precautions to protect personnel involved in recovering and processing those remains.
Because no major CBRN event is the same, exact procedures for each event cannot be addressed.
7.7.1. Expertise. The involvement of CBRN experts in the decontamination process to
include MACRMS personnel and CE emergency management personnel are integral to the
success of contingency mortuary affairs programs. They serve as a guide tailored for each
event. subject matter expert (SME) involvement is needed during these processes. In-cases of
a CBRN event, consult with both military and civilian experts from the medical,
chemical/biological/nuclear science community.
7.7.2. Responsibilities. The primary joint mortuary affairs mission in a CBRN environment
is the establishment and operation of a MACRMS to complete identification tasks and
contamination mitigation. Unit personnel, wearing appropriate MOPP gear, are responsible for
the recovery of deceased unit members while evacuating the area.
7.7.2.1. If remains are contaminated with CBRN agents, all efforts will be made to
decontaminate them and return through routine channels.
7.7.2.2. The US Army, as the Executive Agent for Mortuary Affairs, has dedicated
decontamination teams and is responsible to respond to all contamination events. They are
responsible for decontamination and certification of remains as decontaminated prior to
transport out of the AOR or OCONUS.
7.7.2.3. For remains that cannot be decontaminated, protecting the health of service
members and the public must take precedence over the rapid repatriation of remains.
Safety, not speed, is paramount. Until safe handling procedures and materials can be
identified for decontamination, temporary refrigerated storage, or interment of those
contaminated remains still posing a threat to public health is the recommended method of
disposition. The temperature of the refrigeration container must be maintained between
34- and 40-degrees Fahrenheit (1.1- to 4.4-degrees Celsius). Ensure the temperature is
checked at periodic intervals. Do not freeze human remains under any circumstances.
7.7.2.4. Presently, cremation is the only 100 percent effective means to completely
decontaminate human remains. In accordance with Department of Defense Instruction
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
7-19
 
 
(DODI) 1300.29, Mortuary Affairs Program, biologically or chemically contaminated
identified remains of all DOD employees, to include contractors, may be cremated in a
DOD operated or DOD contracted facility at the request of the PADD if deemed as an
appropriate option by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. This does not
apply to radiologically contaminated remains.
7.7.3. Handling Contaminated Remains. Currently, Air Force’s role in this process is to
perform temporary refrigerated storage or interment of remains, if it has been determined
remains cannot be decontaminated. The geographic CCDR is the only authority to authorize or
direct temporary interment
7.7.3.1. Force support representatives in the EOC will request Army mortuary affairs
decontamination support and/or approval for temporary storage or interment through
JMAO to the geographic CCDR.
7.7.3.2. Processing Contaminated Remains. In the event the Army cannot decontaminate
remains or they cannot respond in a timely manner, EFSS personnel dressed in appropriate
PPE or MOPP 4 should perform the following steps to process contaminated remains:
7.7.3.2.1. Search for UXOs, weapons, and ammunition.
7.7.3.2.2. Check remains for possible BTB information and follow standard tagging
procedures. If transporting remains to MACRMS mortuary affairs decontamination
collection point (MADCP), add evacuation number.
7.7.3.2.3. Obtain DD Form 2064 from medical personnel. Place all documentation in
a sealed plastic bag and place in the HRP. Add copies of all documentation to the
individual case file.
7.7.3.2.4. Properly mark remains with appropriate CBRN marking kit signs inside and
outside of HRP if available. If kits are not available, place the letter “C” on the BTB
information tags to identify contamination. Attach one tag to the remains, one to the
HRP, and complete DD Form 1077.
7.7.3.3. Double pouch remains. Leave all clothing, gear (including helmets, vests, safety
equipment or organization equipment) and PE on remains to aid in identification at
AFMAO/PM. Place HRPs in sealed refrigeration units or temporarily inter.
7.7.3.3.1. If temporary interment is necessary, the dimensions are 80 feet long and 6
and one-half feet deep.
7.7.3.3.2. Temporary interment sites with contaminated remains will be marked and
provided with 24-hour security.
7.7.3.3.3. Accurately address the number and status of contaminated remains on daily
SITREPs.
7.8. Health, Hygiene and Safety. Safety is a major concern in all operations. Leaders should be
aware of safety-related factors involving remains handling. Constantly monitor sanitation of the
MACP and personnel.
7.8.1. Sanitation. Disinfect the MACP daily or as needed by mopping the floor and wiping
down tables with hot water and cleaning solutions.
 
 
7-20
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
7.8.2. Heat Stress and Work/Rest Cycles. Heat stress is a vital aspect when working in the
MACP. Supervisors must watch for signs of heat injury, such as headache, nausea, vertigo,
weakness, thirst, and delirium and confusion.
7.8.2.1. Base work and rest cycles upon location and environment. Once personnel reach
their maximum workload for heat stress, they cannot recover quickly enough to
accomplish the mortuary mission.
7.8.3. Lifting Requirements. Personnel must follow proper lifting techniques when moving
remains. In accordance with Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards,
they should be instructed on how to lift with their legs, not their back and should not lift more
than 75 pounds individually.
7.8.4. Blood-Borne Pathogens. During the handling of remains, take care to avoid exposure
to body fluids. Rubber gloves, aprons, surgical masks, and eye protection must be worn when
working with remains. If contact is made, wash the area immediately with a disinfectant or
soap solution.
7.8.5. DMH Team. All personnel involved in contingency mortuary operations will receive a
DMH Team debrief prior to returning to their regular duties.

Chapter 8
CH8 KEEPING AIRMEN FIT TO FIGHT
KEEPING AIRMEN FIT TO FIGHT
8.1. Overview. This chapter provides proven TTP for establishing and maintaining fitness
operations. Fitness adds to the QoL at a base and helps ensure that all members of the Air Force
are physically fit to support the Air Force mission per Department of the Air Force manual
(DAFMAN) 36-2905, Fitness Program. Fitness operations accommodate both outdoor and indoor
amenities to provide exercise opportunities that keep Airmen fit to fight.
8.2. Fitness Programs. Initially, limited fitness functions may not be supported because the
delivery of higher priority mission items prevents the delivery of fitness equipment. Fitness
programs should progress in scope as managers procure the equipment and the facilities improve.
In accordance with AFI 34-266, Fitness, Sports, and World Class Athlete Program, fitness
personnel acquire and maintain equipment, design exercise programs, and provide physical and
mental health support from combat activities through self-directed and directed exercise
programs.
8.3. Open the Base Considerations.
8.3.1. Funding. Fitness centers are Category A, mission essential programs and are
authorized 100 percent appropriated fund (APF) support. APFs should be used to support
contingency site operations, to fund items (furnishings, equipment, supplies), and to establish
amenities commensurate with contingency requirements.
8.3.1.1. Do not use APFs to recreate or duplicate support amenities available at
established Air Force installations. Refer to DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1, Budget
Guidance and Technical Procedures, AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale,
Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and other Nonappropriated Instrumentalities (NAFIS),
and AFI 65-610, Guidance for Expenditures at Deployed Locations, for guidance on
appropriated funding support.
8.3.1.2. When APFs are not available for capital or operational needs for which
appropriated funds are authorized, include them as unfunded requirements in the
appropriated fund budget.
8.3.1.3. When military fitness and sports facilities are not available, APFs are sometimes
authorized to contract with specified local facilities. Refer to AFI 65-106, Chapter 9,
Contracting for Physical Fitness Services, for details on who is authorized to contract for
commercial fitness services and approval processes.
8.3.1.4. EFSS commanders and Prime RIBS personnel are responsible for ensuring all
purchases are necessary, prudent, and controlled to those necessary to support deployed
mission operations.
8.3.1.5. The support element containing Air Force services activities is the only
organization authorized to purchase recreation and physical fitness equipment.
Non-services activity units are prohibited from procuring recreation and physical fitness
equipment. This provision also applies to televisions, digital versatile discs, and compact
disc players procured with appropriated funds for recreational or fitness purposes.
 
 
8-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
8.3.2. Planning. Prime RIBS should plan for future phases and operations. Consider the
environment, location, and become familiar with the other units that might assist with set up.
8.3.2.1. Fitness and sports programs should contribute to readiness and improve
productivity by promoting total fitness, esprit de corps, and QoL for deployed personnel.
Activities should have different levels of involvement and support. The degree of planning
and effort involved in providing programs depends on the nature of the activity, mission
requirements, customer demand, and available resources.
8.3.3. Fitness Assets. The only fitness assets contained in the WRM program are shelters.
Any fitness equipment required will have to be purchased by Prime RIBS. Check local sources
for availability and commercial quality of items such as fitness equipment, cleaning supplies,
or lockers. If local sources are available, coordinate with Theater Service Planner for theater
sources for purchase. Deliberate planning can make the job easier.
8.3.4. Safety and Environmental Considerations. Consult with CE and occupational safety
to have a safety inspection conducted to correct possible occupational hazards before opening
the fitness facility. Determine if there are any known environmental hazards that could restrict
operations or require theater logistics, contract, or engineering support before the facilities or
sites are usable. There may be host nation restrictions on use of certain types of facilities due
to location, environmental pollution, or other support concerns.
8.3.5. Self-Directed Activities. Most of the programming during this phase should be
self-directed. Self-directed activities permit customers to use facilities and equipment without
the assistance of fitness staff. In self-directed programs, participants abide by rules they
establish and monitor themselves (e.g., half-court basketball games, running, calisthenics).
See Figure 8.1, Contingency Self-Directed Fitness Example.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
8-3
 
 
Figure 8.1. Contingency Self-Directed Fitness Example
8.3.6. Facilities. If possible, obtain hard wall shelters or other more permanent facilities since
quality shelters are a high priority for housing cardiovascular and selectorized equipment and
often provide force protection features.
8.3.6.1. Evaluate existing facilities for use as a fitness facility. If there are not any
buildings sufficient for a fitness facility, then erect either small or medium (preferred)
shelter system structures.
8.3.6.2. Facilities that are open 24/7 should have sufficient environmental control units
(heating and air conditioning) for comfort. Seal facilities to prevent blowing dust and sand
to keep machines functioning better.
8.3.6.3. Provide for adequate entry foyers, walk-off mats, and outside wind baffles (if
needed) to prevent sand, dirt, and dust from blowing in when doors are closed if hardened
facilities are unavailable.
8.3.6.4. Whether building up operations on a more permanent basis or operating within
the constraints of WRM assets, there are many possible QoL enhancements to make with
APFs. The mission and environment at some locations may make it impractical to support
fully equipped fitness facilities. Prime RIBS personnel should conduct an assessment to
determine the best type of facility to support either self-directed or directed fitness
programs.
8.3.6.5. To store electric equipment like treadmills, trailers or modular buildings make an
excellent option. A low-cost alternative is to utilize coalition or host nation assets.
 
 
8-4
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Establish a fix memorandum of work (MOW) in writing to determine is responsible for
what and file it in the life of the deployment (LOD) file for future rotation use.
8.3.7. Siting Considerations. The final step in plan development is to site the fitness
facilities. This will require deliberate coordination with EFSS leadership and ECES to best site
the operation to support both near term mission requirements and allow for expansion as the
location matures. See Table 8.1, Fitness Siting Planning Factors 
Table 8.1. Fitness Siting Planning Factors
8.3.8. Site Layout. CE site developers are responsible for site layout. Threat level generally
determines what site layout will look like. Ideally, plan for fitness facilities to be central to
other MWR and services operations within walking distance of contingency quarters. Prime
RIBS should advocate for space for expansion as well as space for outdoor activities such as
running tracks and sports fields.
8.4. Operate the Base. In this phase, incorporate self-directed and directed programs, leagues,
and tournaments. Prime RIBS should understand the demographics of deployed personnel and
develop programs to fit their needs. Programs that work during one rotation may require
adjustments during the next rotation based on demographics, weather, and resources. Complete
after-action reports for future events.
8.4.1. Operations. Operations codifies how Prime RIBS will systematically program and
implement fitness and sports programs as well as other managerial functions.
8.4.2. Directed Activities. Prime RIBS provides direct oversight of services facilities and
equipment. Directed activities involve either military staff and/or contract services actively
offering programs that support the fitness and recreational needs of deployed forces. A popular
example of a directed activity is a combat aerobics class led by a fitness specialist or trained
instructor. Other examples of organized fitness activities include 5-kilometer fun runs,
basketball or volleyball tournaments, aerobics classes, and martial arts.
8.4.3. Fitness Incentive Program. In addition to directed activity programs, plan fitness
incentive programs that set the stage for accomplishing milestones for levels of fitness
efforts-present awards for achievement and regular level effort awards.
8.4.3.1. Fitness incentive awards are purchased with APF funds. According to DAFMAN
65-605, Volume 1, the unit cost of any incentive item will not exceed $10.
8.4.3.2. Due to high costs, coins or medallions should not be used as incentive items.
1. Slope of terrain is < 18 inches over entire floor plan.
2. Area flat, high, dry, good drainage.
3. Meets force protection and threat requirements.
4. Latrine and shower/shave located nearby (but downwind from quarters and feeding 
facilities).
5. Close to potable water source.
6. Adequate for future expansion.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
8-5
 
 
8.4.3.3. Only one fitness incentive award can be given to a participant per program type.
Participants can receive multiple awards if they are earned in multiple program types.
EXAMPLE: If there is a running fitness incentive program that leads to an award at the 50-, 100-,
150-, and 200-mile distances, the participant can only receive an award for the running program
once. If they receive an award for completing 50 miles, they cannot receive another one at the
100-mile distance. It is strongly encouraged that participants wait until they are about to redeploy
home to receive the award for the greatest achievement earned.
8.4.3.4. Sports Competitions. Coordinate with financial management (FM) prior to
purchasing awards to ensure the prize is consistent with FM requirements and does not
exceed monetary thresholds.
8.4.3.4.1. Use APF to purchase T-shirts, trophies, plaques, or similar items for
presentation to winners of intramural sports and athletic competitions.
8.4.3.4.2. Such competitions should be of a continuing nature.
8.4.3.4.3. T-shirts can be used in lieu of other awards and cannot be used in
conjunction with any plaque, medal/medallion, trophy, or similar device. No other type
of shirt is authorized.
8.4.3.4.4. Awards, including T-shirts, may be given to winners only and not
participants in general.
8.4.3.4.5. The trophies, plaques, or similar devices should be for display purposes
only, and not redeemable for cash, merchandise, or services.
8.4.3.4.6. The term winner is defined as the top three finishing persons/teams in
recognized categories of intramural sports and athletic competitions.
8.4.3.4.7. For team awards, one award per team for first through third place is
authorized as well as an individual award for each member of the first-place team.
8.4.3.5. Authorized Personnel. Prime RIBS personnel who control a specific program
(e.g., planning scheduling, prize determination) as well as EFSS Leadership, (i.e.,
commander, deputy commander, superintendent); can participate in programs but are
encouraged not to accept any prizes due to the appearance of impropriety.
8.4.3.5.1. The EFSS commander should establish a policy regarding Prime RIBS
personnel eligible to participate and accept prizes. Contractors may participate in
events as long as it does not detract from the ability to support regeneration of the
Airmen.
8.4.3.5.2. The EFSS commander can make a recommendation for AEW commander
approval to restrict contractors from participating if it is determined their participation
is impeding the recreation programming. Refer to DAFI 34-101, Air Force Morale,
Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Programs and Use Eligibility, Table A2.1 for further
guidance on program participation eligibility.
8.4.4. Fitness Equipment. When Airmen are forced indoors due to weather, cardiovascular
training equipment (upright recumbent stationary bicycles, stair steppers, treadmills, and
elliptical machines) is a valuable tool for keeping fit. While free weights are relatively
 
 
8-6
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
trouble-free if kept clean, equipment with moving parts (cardiovascular equipment and
selectorized resistance training equipment) is susceptible to blowing dust and sand at many
deployed locations. It requires constant service and shielding from the elements.
8.4.4.1. Choosing Equipment. Depending on the outside temperature and weather
conditions at the location, expect to have robust cardiovascular training equipment such as
stationary bicycles, treadmills, elliptical total body machines, stair steppers, and stationary
recumbent bikes.
8.4.4.2. Specifications. Equipment specifications should be considered when determining
what equipment to purchase. Some brands are more durable than others and are more
suited to harsh environments. See Table 8.2, Elliptical/Total Body Machine Specifications
for sample equipment specifications.

8.4.4.3. Obtaining Equipment. All equipment purchases should be coordinated and
approved by the contracting office. When evaluating equipment to purchase, remember
that repair and service contracts are difficult to obtain, so it may be beneficial to order
equipment for which local sources can provide repair and service contracts. Companies
that offer a training program on equipment repair are also worthy of consideration.
8.4.4.3.1. Coordinate with the Theater Services Planner for examples of existing
support contracts and consider recommendations and experience from nearby bases.
Ask the Theater Services Planner about the redistribution of used equipment, as this is
a faster way to obtain quality items and parts.
8.4.4.3.2. Some short-term locations may have an opportunity to pick up used
equipment from closing units; however, this type of used equipment may not meet
long-term expectations. If AF Form 9s, Request for Purchase are used, be as detailed

8.4.5. Sustain the Base Actions. In this phase, maintain facilities and equipment. Consider
expansion if needed.
8.4.5.1. Fitness Center Equipment Standards. For fitness, the standards equate to
obtaining the numbers needed for the various equipment to support the location. It also
includes providing for fitness activities, including group fitness, with instructors.
Experience shows that many more people work out when deployed, which can increase the
amount of equipment needed.
8.4.5.1.1. Tailor the overall fitness equipment selections to meet the needs of the
location. Use a planning factor of 1:35 for cardiovascular equipment (one piece of
equipment per 35 personnel). See Table 8.3, Small Population Equipment Package,
Table 8.4, Medium Population Equipment Package, and Table 8.5, Large Population
Equipment Package for details and minimum standards.
Formula: 35/number of people = number of machines.
8.4.5.1.2. For planning purposes, there should be at least two feet of space between
each piece of equipment to ensure safety and access to the machine. Refer to shelters
for dimensions for accurate calculations.
8.4.5.1.3. There may be additional facilities and shelters across the base for classes,
unit physical fitness (PT), and self-PT. Ensure to adhere to all safety procedures and
check facilities routinely.

8.4.6. Unit Physical Training Facilities. A unit physical training facility is authorized by the
installation commander when the installation fitness facilities cannot meet the requesting
unit’s requirements. Unit owned, funded, and maintained fitness areas not operated by force
support. Unit physical training facilities are to be kept to a minimum.
8.4.6.1. Unit physical training facilities should have local operating instruction
established that includes, at a minimum:
• A wingman system that will be used at all times.
• An available automatic external defibrillator.
• Emergency phone numbers posted within the fitness room.
• An available phone within the room for emergency use.
• Equipment should meet Air Force fitness and sports standards.
8.4.6.2. Units approved to operate a unit physical training facility should coordinate with
the fitness and sports manager prior to the unit purchasing equipment and maintenance
contracts using Allowance Standard 410, Allowance ID: 410COOB, and in accordance
with manufacturer’s recommendations.
8.4.6.3. Funding for equipment purchase and maintenance is the responsibility of the
owning unit.
8.4.7. Fitness Access (24/7 Facilities). Access outside of normal operating hours can be
implemented at main, additional, or satellite force support fitness facilities. Installation
commanders or designated authority should conduct an operational risk management
assessment and determine if access will be restricted to specific activity areas. Facilities
should have:
• A wingman policy posted in the facility.
• Written standards for facility use should be established for the installation and posted in
the facility.

• Automatic external defibrillator.
• Phone with list of emergency phone numbers.
• First aid kit.
• Readily assessable emergency response procedures posted in the facility.
8.4.8. Amenities. Plan to provide lockers and changing areas with shower room and latrine
facilities attached to the fitness area. Add music and televisions to fitness facilities,
particularly weight rooms and facilities that offer cardiovascular and selectorized equipment.
8.4.9. Resale Operations. At locations where a NAFI or unit fund is established, sites have
the capability to generate NAFs revenue from resale operations to provide for enhanced MWR
programming. A combined resale option within a fitness facility or fitness-recreation complex
is often well-received by deployed personnel. Ensure that these resale operations are available
to customers.
8.4.9.1. Resale items should not be dated or single out a specific rotation/event/special
day because it limits the customer base and restricts sales to a particular date and time (i.e.,
Valentine’s Day t-shirts or EFSS coins).
8.4.9.2. Resale items should not be purchased for sale to a restricted group. Agencies may
request the EFSS to purchase items for them as long as they pre-pay in advance of the
items being ordered for them.
8.4.9.3. Restocking of inventory will be done with sufficient lead time to ensure
continuance of a viable resale operation, to include crossing over AFFORGEN rotations. It
is the responsibility of the outgoing AFFORGEN team to ensure orders are placed so there
is no gap in receiving stock for the incoming team.
8.4.9.4. If possible, include juice and sports drinks, power snacks, other health food
products, sports and specialty apparel, and equipment items.
8.4.10. Outdoor Exercise Areas. During sustainment (and depending on land availability),
establish outside activities where possible. Construct playing fields, courts, and baseball
diamonds to support activities such as baseball, softball, basketball, soccer, football,
volleyball, badminton, and horseshoes.
8.4.10.1. If the location has space and is hospitable enough to support outside activities,
set up jogging and running trails. Establish exercise station setups on running trails for
variety, fitness, and stretching. See Figure 8.3, Outdoor Fitness Space Example.

Figure 8.3. Outdoor Fitness Space Example
8.4.11. Maintaining Equipment. Specific manufacturer guidelines for preventive
maintenance and repair of equipment should be followed.
8.4.11.1. Record Keeping. Keep good records on equipment use hours to aid in scheduling
maintenance and forecasting replacement needs. Program a replacement schedule and
budget. Account for time delays when ordering equipment.
8.4.11.2. A detailed equipment repair log is required to document and track vendor
reliability and equipment performance. Log should include type of equipment, model
number, reason for operational malfunction, dates of report, and repair).
8.4.11.3. Fitness equipment used 24/7 in harsh environmental conditions at contingency
and joint service locations may need more frequent repair and replacement than equipment
at a CONUS base. Repair and replacement may be hard to get in remote locations. Even
with high-quality equipment housed in moderately well-protected structures, equipment
may only last half the standard four- to five-year lifespan.
8.4.11.4. To prevent rapid loss of equipment and reduce downtime, Prime RIBS should
provide more frequent and aggressive care and maintenance by developing preventive
maintenance plans.
8.4.11.5. Prime RIBS should become familiar with equipment maintenance manuals and
minor repairs. Determine which types of repairs are manageable by staff members and
ensure that those staff members receive training.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
8-15
 
 
8.4.11.6. Obtain equipment maintenance contracts as soon as possible. Contract examples
are available from Theater Services Planners.
8.4.12. Routine Maintenance. Prime RIBS should ensure that equipment is kept clean and
well maintained to prevent accidents and lessen the chances of transmitting infectious diseases
and illnesses. Develop a schedule and have users, volunteers, and contract civilian workers
routinely check the equipment for maintenance, health, and safety issues. Be diligent about
getting users to clean the equipment after each use. To do this effectively, provide convenient
access to towels, trash receptacles, quality vacuums, and other materials that users will need to
assist with keeping equipment clean. Contract support may be available for towels, trash
pickup, and other cleaning tasks.
8.4.13. Preventive Maintenance Schedules. When developing preventive maintenance
plans, tailor the checklist shown to each piece of equipment based on environmental
conditions, amount of use each piece of equipment receives, and the manufacturer’s
recommended maintenance schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually).
See Table 8.6, Recommended Preventative Maintenance Schedule Common Guidelines.

8.4.14. Maintenance and Repairs Purchase Considerations. When 
obtaining 
new
equipment through the contracting office, ensure that maintenance and repair are included as
part of the purchase. To minimize equipment downtime, keep spare parts and backups on hand
for the most used equipment. Be sure to include the shipping/handling cost into the
budget/expense.
8.4.14.1. Documentation. Document equipment historical maintenance reports in the
LOD file to identify problems with types and brands of equipment. Documenting provides
an effective way to track recurring issues, equipment misuse, or faulty equipment. This
information will be valuable for follow-on teams when considering replacement or
planning maintenance and repair support.
8.4.15. Managing Fitness Resources. The fitness center director maintains control of
resources. EFSS designated officers and SNCOs are accountable for assets and should
carefully monitor them. Refer to AFMAN 34-204, Property Management.
8.4.15.1. Accountability includes taking appropriate steps to obtain new equipment and
return old equipment. Identify requirements for theater contracts or some contract
augmentation for support to maintain, repair, and replace failing equipment. Refer to
AFMAN 34-202, Procedures for Protecting Nonappropriated Funds Assets and AFMAN
34-204.
8.4.15.2. While all Prime RIBS members are responsible for safeguarding equipment,
supervisors should appoint responsible and knowledgeable people to oversee resources.
8.4.16. Unit Personnel. If a unit has trained instructors and certified fitness personnel, they
can conduct customer-requested activities. If not, ask the base for certified or trained
professionals. EFSS commanders can also elect to fill some positions for more extended
periods with trained or certified government civilians.
8.4.17. Continuity. Maintaining continuity between rotations during deployments is a
challenge, but it is vital to long-term success. Since there is such a divergence of continuity
folders (LOD file) between locations and rotations, a recommended standard format has been
developed. The goal is to smooth-out the transitions for future rotations, create a conduit for
the transfer of information between rotations, and ease the burden created by 100 percent
turnover of personnel every 179 days.
8.4.17.1. All items in the continuity binder have a minimum 24-month disposition. Each
function/activity should have a continuity binder that is applicable to their operation. It is
imperative that each rotation keep these continuity books updated, with the understanding
that certain tabs may not require much attention. Other tabs may change frequently (e.g.,
why I did what I did [WIDWID], AF Form 9s).
8.4.17.2. The goal is to document and learn from both the successes and disappointments.
Over time, there should develop good continuity during and between rotations. For
example, this would allow one Christmas rotation to look back in time and learn from the
successes and failures of the previous functions held during Christmas over multiple years.
8.4.17.3. The commander, flight chief, and superintendent books should be tailored to
their position. For example, rather than have a copy of every AF Form 9, the book should
state where the central location of AF Form 9s can be found. Below are the tabs that, at a
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022

minimum, should be included in the continuity binder. See Table 8.7, Example Continuity
Binder Tabs.
Table 8.7. Example Continuity Binder Tabs
Tab
Description
Tab1: Nuggets
Include disposition instructions for the contents of the continuity folder. 
This tab should also contain a letter from the outgoing 
commander/facility manager to the incoming commander/facility 
manager that explains the WIDWID (why I did what I did). All 
contents will remain in the folder for a period of one Air Force Force 
Generation (AFFORGEN) cycle, which is currently 20 months, unless 
other guidance demands a longer life span.
Tab 2: Contracts
Include copies of all contracts, amendments, and contracting officer’s 
representative (COR) actions.
Tab 3: AF Form 9s
Include copies of all AF Form 9s. It should also include local 
procedures for filling AF Form 9s. Draft AF Form-9s (turned in to 
contracting but without a control number) as well as routed AF Form 9s 
should be maintained. Receiving documents and other documentation 
should also be included.
Tab 4: Miscellaneous 
Purchases
Include tracking of all Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF) and 
government purchase card (GPC) purchases as applicable.
Tab 5: Equipment
Include equipment/parts inventories for each section, as well as 
replacement plans.
Tab 6: Supplies
Include par stock and usage rates for all expendable supplies utilized 
within the operation.     
Tab 7: Maintenance
Include a maintenance history of all equipment, as well as sub-tabs for 
AF Form 332s, Base Civil Engineer Work Request and a work order 
log.
Tab 8: Construction/
Facilities
Include documentation of all site-specific construction. This tab may 
have greater life expectancy than the 20 months for the other tabs as 
construction, from design to operation, can take many years. 
Tab 9: Policy
Include all applicable locally generated guidance and policy directed 
from higher headquarters that is applicable to the operation.
Tab 10: Checklists/
Procedures
Include all checklists necessary to the operation of the individual 
programs (e.g., equipment preventative maintenance and safety 
checklists).

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Tab 11: After Action 
Reports
Include all after-action reports that are generated at the close of the 
deployment. Written to follow-on forces, this tab should include far 
more details than are included in the after-action report that is sent to 
higher headquarters.
Tab 12: Operations
Include items specific to the operation of the specific function. For 
instance, for recreation it should include event calendars, as well as 
specific descriptions of how each event.
Tab 13: Life of the 
Fund File
The NAF custodian and each cost center should maintain a life of the 
fund (LOF) file, and it should be safeguarded (lockable filing cabinet 
recommended). All required documentation from the inception of the 
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI)/cost center until it is 
dissolved should be maintained in the LOF file. At a minimum, the 
following should be maintained: budgets, accountable items, policy 
letters/memorandums for record (MFR), inventory records, prize logs, 
and delegation/authorization letters.

Chapter 9
CH9 AIRMEN REGENERATION
AIRMAN REGENERATION
9.1. Introduction. This chapter provides proven TTP for establishing and maintaining recreation
operations as part of an Airman regeneration program.
9.2. Regeneration Operations. Recreation, resale, and theater facilities/services help regenerate
Airmen at a contingency location by creating diversions from work stress and family separation
anxiety. Recreation activities are directed or self-directed mediums—some indoors and some
outdoors—that can begin in earnest once the base is open for operations. Examples include audio
or video compact disks (CD)/digital video discs (DVD), televisions for watching movies, live
satellite events or news, board or electronic games, and tables for foosball, pool, and ping-pong.
The overall goal for a deployed recreation and regeneration program should be to develop
capabilities that support a variety of activities and obtain permanent facilities for recreational
programming.
9.2.1. Meeting QoL Needs. Before UTC equipment sets arrive, Prime RIBS should
determine recreation priorities for the contingency location based on the unique environment,
the ability to obtain equipment, and available support by local purchase or contract. Work with
ECES to improve facilities when operations have reached full operating capability.
9.2.1.1. Prime RIBS should start planning for the buildup of morale, welfare, and
recreation (MWR) services as soon as possible. Deliberate planning early in the
deployment will lead to greater success in recreation programs.
9.2.1.2. The deployed population dictates the personnel and UTC support for recreation
and regeneration functions. Prime RIBS members and EFSS leadership are tasked with
developing plans to best use available resources to achieve mission success. Expected
levels of service for MWR can vary based on environment. See Table 9.1, MWR Services
Based on Environment.
Table 9.1. MWR Services Based on Environment
9.2.1.3. Deployment Phases. The deployment phases are aligned to (but not the same as)
force elements and help identify both the status of the base from an operational standpoint
and the expected resources Prime RIBS members should have available. See Table 9.2,
Deployment Phase Regeneration Actions.

9-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Table 9.2. Deployment Phase Regeneration Actions
9.3. Open the Base. MWR programs are Category A, to include recreational programming,
which means they are mission essential programs and are authorized 100 percent appropriated
fund support. Refer to DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1, AFI 65-106, and AFI 65-610, for guidance
on appropriated funding support.
9.3.1. Purchases. Force Support Commanders and Prime RIBS are responsible for ensuring
all purchases are necessary, prudent, and controlled to those necessary to support deployed
mission operations.
9.3.2. Authority. The support element containing Air Force Services activities is the only
organization authorized to purchase recreation and physical fitness equipment. Non-services
activity units are prohibited from procuring recreation and physical fitness equipment. This
provision also applies to televisions, digital versatile discs, and compact disc players procured
with APFs for recreational or fitness purposes.
9.3.3. Planning. Members should plan for future phases and operations at this time. Consider
the environment and location and become familiar with the other units that might assist with
set up. Recreation programs should also contribute to readiness and improve productivity by
promoting Comprehensive Airmen Fitness, esprit de corps, and QoL for deployed personnel.
Activities should have different levels of involvement and support. The degree of planning and
effort involved in providing programs depends on the nature of the activity, mission
requirements, warfighter demand, and available resources.
9.3.4. Location Type and Local Conditions. The only recreation assets contained in the
WRM program are shelters, limited cards, and board games. Any recreation equipment or
assets required will have to be purchased by Prime RIBS. Are there local sources to purchase
items such as televisions, tables, chairs, pool tables, gaming consoles and games, couches,
DVD players, audio systems, and cleaning supplies? Are the items available locally of
sufficient commercial quality to support extensive use? Coordinate with Theater Services
Planners for sources for purchase. Planning ahead can make the job easier.
9.3.5. Recreational Support. Upon arrival at the deployed location, begin reviewing and
modifying predeployment plans as necessary to meet site conditions. Many predeployment
plans can be implemented with minor modification, but changes or an interrupted flow of
resources may occur that require modified plans. If deployed to a joint task force, immediately

determine who is currently in charge of the location. This will help establish POCs with other
units to ensure mutual support.
9.3.6. Facilities and Shelters. The mission and environment at some locations may make it
impractical to support fully equipped recreation facilities. An assessment should be conducted
to determine the best type of facility to support either self-directed or directed recreational
programs. Recreation facilities are usually erected from either small or medium (preferred)
shelter systems. Initially, establish a recreation and movie tent. Modular buildings prevent
intrusion from dust and water and make great facilities for housing electronic equipment (e.g.,
computers, video game platforms, CD/DVD players in recreation facilities, cash registers in
resale facilities).
9.3.6.1. When possible, establish a large services resale operation or an AAFES tactical
exchange in highly secure facilities with hard-walls (e.g., an expandable shelter container,
modular facility, or mobile trailer unit). If hard-walled facilities are not available, tents
(one for resale and one for storage) may be used but must be secure. A low-cost alternative
is to utilize coalition or host nation assets. When coalition or host nation facilities are used,
establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in writing to determine who will be
responsible for what and file it for future rotations to use. Obtain a larger multi-use shelter
or facility that can be used during sustainment for entertainment events, bazaar, and
concessionaire fairs (outside of AAFES normal efforts), large meetings, dances, sporting
events, and larger screen movies.
9.3.7. Location. Recreation and resale facilities should be laid out in a centralized area near
main paths of travel to dining facilities and should be accessible for delivery of supplies and
equipment. If serving a joint operation, determine with other service counterparts what assets
are being shipped in and where they should be positioned to better serve overall resale, fitness,
and recreational needs. When applicable, plan to locate satellite resale functions near the
flightline and primary work areas.
9.3.8. Duration. Temporary contingency locations primarily use WRM or a limited number
of deployable type containerized shelters for support of activities. Long-term locations can
obtain more permanent structures to house these functions. If possible, obtain hard wall
shelters or other more permanent facilities, as quality shelters are a high priority for housing
electronic equipment and often provide force protection features. Facilities should have
sufficient environmental control units (heating and air conditioning) for comfort and should be
sealed against blowing dust and sand. Whether building up operations on a more permanent
basis or operating within the constraints of WRM assets, there are many possible QoL
enhancements to make with contingency APFs.
9.3.9. Initial Programming. The majority of programs offered in this phase will be
self-directed based on the limited assets available. Begin planning for directed activities and
initiate funding requests to purchase furnishings, equipment, and assets to fully develop
program offerings.
9.3.9.1. While assets may be limited, programming is only limited by imagination. There
are opportunities to use on-site assets to deliver morale-sustaining programs until more
robust programs can be enacted. Programs such as scavenger hunts, Texas Hold’em
tournaments, and bingo nights require minimal assets and are wildly popular.
 
 
9-4
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
9.4. Operate the Base. During the operate the base phase, Prime RIBS efforts should be focused
on receiving any remaining Prime RIBS forces, bringing facilities to operational status with
purchased assets to offer diverse recreational programs, developing programs and programming
calendars, and developing budgets for necessary equipment and supplies. If a NAFI has been
established, begin resale operations if not already started.
9.4.1. Collocating Facilities. Prudently collocate functions that fit together based on
compatibility. For example, it is not a good idea to have personnel watching movies on
television or talking on morale phones next to personnel who are studying-even when users
have headphones. Work with CE to ensure adequate power, heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC), and lighting in separate facilities. Cluster similar activities together
(e.g., active recreational efforts such as board and video games, games of chance, ping-pong,
pinball).
9.4.1.1. While larger WRM shelters afford space for sound-deadening partitions and
separation distances, most quiet library functions should be collocated with educational
functions and not with music and video libraries or morale center computers and phones. It
may be easier to monitor and manage supplies if smaller games (e.g., pocket-sized video
games and software) are kept in one area rather than stocking those items where large
amusement games are located.
9.4.2. Programming. Prime RIBS should plan programs a minimum of 90 days in advance to
deconflict programming with other organizations, garner appropriate approvals, and procure
necessary supplies. Previous rotations should have the first three months of programs planned
and order most of what is needed to execute. Programming for the next 90 days should occur
monthly as monthly calendar meetings help to deconflict MWR efforts and identify
opportunities to partner with other services sections.
9.4.3. Self-Directed, Directed and Special Events. Recreation and regeneration programs
should provide a combination of directed and self-directed activities consisting of a good mix
of individual, self-paced, small group, team sports, and larger, organized competitive
activities. Prime RIBS should understand the demographics of the deployed service personnel
and develop programs to fit their needs. Efforts that work during one rotation may require
adjustments during the next rotation based on demographics, weather, and resources.
9.4.3.1. Self-Directed Activities. Self-directed recreation activities allow warfighters to
use facilities or equipment without the assistance of Prime RIBS staff. In self-directed
programs, players participate in solitary activities or abide by rules they establish and
monitor themselves (e.g., casual card, board games, horseshoes, video games, basketball).
Plan a wide variety of activities that are entertaining and meet the needs and interests of the
population mix during that rotation.
9.4.3.2. Directed Activities. Directed activities involve oversight (by either Prime RIBS
or contract support) of services facilities and equipment. A popular example of a directed
activity is combat bingo-sometimes for prizes (gift cards or actual prizes) and other times
for fun as a healthy diversion. Other examples of organized recreation activities include
trivia night, Super Bowl parties, takeoffs of popular games shows, and organized video
game tournaments upon FOC.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-5
 
 
9.4.3.3. Special Events. Many events build morale among deployed personnel. Examples
include open microphone comedy routines, talent shows, and installation rotational
parties/picnics. As resources become available, recreation staff can coordinate movie
nights or Armed Forces Network Broadcasts. Depending on available equipment,
tournaments can be organized for horseshoes, foosball, darts, card games, chess games,
dominoes, and other activities appropriate for the location.
9.4.3.4. Recreation Equipment. The recreation equipment should be based on the
population size and potential for outdoor recreation (based on weather). The types of
activities and events warfighters want should guide decision-making and be creative when
meeting their desires. Prime RIBS needs to purchase with a purpose. If combat bingo is
popular, accommodate them by having plenty of bingo cards. If purchasing for a movie
room, comfortable chairs are ideal along with DVD players and movies. If purchasing for
a recreation center, think tables and chairs, televisions (TV), audio systems, pool tables,
billiard supplies, ping pong tables and supplies, dominos, and Texas Hold’em supplies.
Game rooms may require video game consoles, headphones, video games, and
comfortable chairs. Identify how to use the space, and then deliberately research and
purchase furnishings, equipment, and assets to maximize programming potential.
9.4.3.5. Obtaining Equipment. The RFSER (Initial Mortuary/Recreation Kit) is the
minimal amount of equipment and supplies authorized for purchase before
deployment—only enough to get the operation going (cards and board games). To move
beyond initial capability, more items need to be budgeted, approved, and ordered.
9.4.3.5.1. Card Games. In a hostile environment, board games and cards remain a
popular choice—and neither requires batteries or electricity. Obtain other commercial
games besides those in the RFSER UTC equipment kit for participatory and
self-directed games and board games.
9.4.3.5.2. Electronic Games. Electronic games (e.g., pocket-sized units, console type
systems, computer games) are popular at deployment locations. Some locations have a
dedicated gaming room for use by warfighters. Popular options include covered
windows, black walls, and gaming chairs configured in front of televisions that are
linked so that 3 to 4 people can play the same game.
9.4.3.5.3. Table Sports. Maintain a good mixture of popular table sports (e.g., pool,
ping-pong, foosball), making sure to stock a large supply of replacement balls,
paddles, cues, and chalk.
9.4.3.5.4. Movies. Movies are a popular way to relax during any phase of a
deployment. Based on weather and threat, the theater used may be a large screen and
film projectors or small shelters or areas with large screen televisions.
9.4.3.5.5. As operations mature into sustainment, add at least one large-venue indoor
or outdoor theater with a projector and large screen, additional speakers, and more
comfortable portable chairs. This can be accomplished using an existing facility (a
multiuse shelter/facility or outdoor pavilion that has a white backdrop to serve as a
screen) and a film projector or multimedia presentation projector. Provide popcorn and
refreshments or locate snack and drink vending machines nearby if no resale operation
 
 
9-6
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
is readily available. Movies can be obtained from AAFES, commercial sources,
donations, sponsors, or libraries.
9.5. Sustainment Actions. During this phase, efforts are focused on improving the quality and
types of programs and services offered as well as strengthening management controls of
operations and enacting contracts for long-term support.
9.5.1. Entertainment. Command support, budgeting, planning, requests, and approvals all
play a big part in acquiring appropriate entertainment work. Managers should know
contracting rules and the length of time needed for entertainment contract turn around.
9.5.1.1. Onsite Entertainment. One of the easiest ways to put on a show with a tight
budget is to use deployed personnel. Many troops are talented singers, dancers, and
comedians. It is not too difficult to stage a talent show with an enthusiastic crowd.
9.5.1.2. Professional Entertainment. Prime RIBS should work with their Theater Services
Planner as well as the theatre/country Armed Forces Entertainment (AFE) coordinator for
all entertainment requests and support. Please note that AFE performs an annual call for
entertainment; therefore, it is important to understand that requirements should flow to
AFE as soon as possible. EFSS does not coordinate with the United Service Organizations
(USO). AFE and the USO coordinate entertainment and work logistical support. Careful
planning and coordination are key to a successful entertainment event.
9.5.1.2.1. To request professional entertainment, route the request through the AFE
country coordinator. The EFSS commander may be the AFE country coordinator if
there is only one base in the country. The EFSS commander forwards all requests to the
regional coordinator. This process is important for routing all issues to include
complaints on current acts or requests for future acts. While top-name performers are
in demand, not all locations receive these kinds of acts each rotation. Many talented
up-and-coming performers are anxious to help boost the morale of deployed personnel
and waive the pay for their performance. Entertainment planning is based on delivering
entertainment to the most needed locations.
9.5.1.3. NAF Funded Entertainment. If the contingency location has a NAFI established
and sufficient funds available, NAFs may be used to purchase entertainment. NAFs should
only be considered to procure entertainment if local leadership determines AFE—provide
entertainment is insufficient. Comedians or smaller groups are far more affordable than
bands and the use of local entertainment reduces transportation costs. All requests for
entertainment should be identified on the NAF requirements budget and approved by the
installation commander. Coordinate with Theater Services Planners if there is a desire to
procure NAF funded entertainment.
9.5.1.4. Logistics and Accommodations. The complexity of logistics support for putting
on a show varies depending on the amount of people, supplies, and equipment needed. For
example, a comedian is easier than a professional wrestling show with multiple
participants and lots of equipment.
9.5.1.4.1. Deployed EFSS planners are tasked with where the entertainer(s) will set up
and stage the show. Work with the different sections at the deployed location to ensure
a successful event.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-7
 
 
9.5.1.4.2. Once entertainers and their entourage arrive, they will likely need a place to
get ready, eat, and sleep. If your location has satellite locations on the schedule for the
entertainer(s) to visit, EFSS planners should coordinate appropriate logistics and travel
as necessary.
9.5.2. Outdoor Facilities. During sustainment, establish outdoor recreation areas based on
land availability (e.g., multipurpose pavilion with a stage). Some locations can obtain
inexpensive, above-ground swimming pool packages. Plans for a pool facility need to be
closely coordinated with CE and Theater Services Planners.
9.5.2.1. Multipurpose Pavilion. If possible, obtain an outdoor multipurpose pavilion.
While desert locations can be too hot during the day to handle special activities using
outdoor pavilions, the pavilion can be used at night with proper lighting. A pavilion with a
stage fitted with sound, lighting, electrical power, and water allows for hosting outdoor
events and holiday parties coordinated with the dining facility. Sun shades are an excellent
idea to shade outdoor pavilions and warfighters for daytime use.
9.5.2.2. Outdoor Stage. Situate a large outdoor stage near an outdoor pavilion and indoor
shelter. If a permanent or portable metal stage is not possible, work with CE to construct a
stage that can be moved or easily broken into component parts and reassembled. Having a
large stage with integrated sound systems, lighting, power connections, and a backdrop for
movies can help capture opportunities when entertainment becomes available (especially
on short notice). The stage can also be used for formal presentations and ceremonies. To
prevent weather damage to equipment, ensure equipment is stored in a secured
climate-controlled storage unit.
9.5.3. Maintaining Facilities. Ensure recreation facilities are included in the base janitorial
contract for maintenance, cleanup, and trash pickup. Order quality vacuum cleaners and have
contractors help use them as needed to keep sand and dirt away from equipment.
9.5.3.1. Develop a monitoring system that allows users, military volunteers, and contract
helpers to keep track of and report maintenance or cleanliness problems with indoor and
outdoor recreation facilities.
9.5.3.2. Consider contract maintenance as an option. It allows Prime RIBS to concentrate
on meeting other warfighter demands and allows Prime RIBS to better oversee activities
and meet security concerns (e.g., large social or special events that involve DVs or
professional entertainment).
9.5.4. Connecting Airmen to the Outside World. These MWR programs allow deployers to
maintain contact with family and friends back home. This includes morale Wi-Fi as well as
morale phones and computers.
9.5.4.1. Morale Wi-Fi. Morale Wi-Fi is procured via a service contract and funded with
APFs. Coordination will be required with the ECS to help define the requirement
(bandwidth and access points) and contracting for the contract. The minimum bandwidth
standard should permit video messaging for the supported population. In some theaters, it
is referred to as Comprehensive Airman Fitness Wi-Fi as it supports the four pillars of
resilience. Before attempting to establish morale Wi-Fi, Prime RIBS should coordinate
with the Theater Services Planner for theater-specific guidance.
 
 
9-8
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
9.5.4.2. In addition to permitting deployers to remain connected with family and friends,
this critical program also permits deployers to continue their professional and personal
educational pursuits, access social media and news sources, and aids in successful
reintegration post-deployment.
9.5.4.3. Morale Phones and Computers. There should be an appropriate number of
computers and phones for the population. Obtain comfortable chairs and tables as well as
privacy curtains and/or insulated side partitions for noise control. Inexpensive rugs or mats
at each communication station can diminish noise that hinders hearing when there are
numerous personnel using the phones. Some locations may be able to provide all DSN
lines, but you may have to use a mix of DSN and commercial lines.
9.5.4.3.1. AAFES contracts have provided phone banks and special hookups for some
locations. If AAFES has not already made arrangements with American Telephone
and Telegraph Company (AT&T®), other providers can also be contacted. To lessen
the likelihood of having to limit user time on phones and computers, situate some
phones and computers at a 24-hour lodging operation where it can be overseen by
lodging personnel if approved locally.
9.5.4.3.2. When there is a large center for morale computers and phones, establish a
cyber café type (APF funded) operation as a QoL initiative. The cyber café can provide
a comfortable atmosphere and include a resale operation for specialty coffee, pastries,
and snacks. Such a resale operation might also sell calling cards.
9.6. Maintaining Equipment. To prevent rapid loss of equipment and reduce downtime, provide
more frequent service (e.g., computers, electronic gaming machines, sound systems, DVD
players) and develop preventive maintenance plans. Determine which types of repairs are
manageable by staff members and ensure that those staff members receive training. Proper
training on the equipment is important not only to provide service but also to prevent damaging
the equipment. From purchase through rotation of forces, orientation of some sort is needed.
Recreation equipment that is used frequently may need more frequent repair and replacement than
equipment at a CONUS base. This repair and replacement may be hard to get in remote locations.
9.6.1. Routine Maintenance. See paragraph 8.4.12 Routine Maintenance.
9.6.1.1. Preventive Maintenance Schedules. See paragraph 8.4.13 Preventative
Maintenance.
9.6.1.2. Repairs. See paragraph 8.4.14 Repairs.
9.6.1.3. Documentation. See paragraph 8.4.15 Managing Fitness Resources.
9.7. Managing Recreation Resources. Prime RIBS must maintain control of resources, as EFSS
designated officers and SNCOs are accountable for assets. This includes taking appropriate steps
to obtain new equipment, returning old equipment, and determining whether the organization
must obtain a theater contract or some type of contract augmentation support to maintain, repair,
and replace failing equipment. While every Airman is responsible for safeguarding equipment,
supervisors should appoint responsible and knowledgeable people to oversee resources. Refer to
AFMAN 34-202 and AFMAN 34-204.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-9
 
 
9.7.1. Support Contracts. The overall level of contract support should be considered by
Wing, mission support group, and EFSS commanders as coordinated with theater planners and
should be included in planning and budget documents.
9.7.2. Recordkeeping. Customer surveys, customer comment forms, and number of
participants are great ways to track the success of programs. After action reports are required
to be completed for all events and filed as directed by the location. Often, Prime RIBS only
want to document what was done well, but there are valuable lessons in identifying what did
not go well for future planning to improve programs. Be honest and critical in the event after
action reports to set future rotations up for success.
9.8. Resale Operations. Resale operations can be a great morale booster, especially if the resale
items fulfill the wants or needs of warfighters. Resale operation should be enacted as soon as
possible. Although identified in the sustain the base phase, this important program should be
offered at the first available opportunity.
9.8.1. Exchanges. High on the priority list for warfighters is obtaining even a limited AAFES
field exchange or NAF resale operation. AAFES is the primary supplier of retail merchandise.
Primary resale efforts should begin with basic hygiene and convenience essentials such as
soap, shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrush, towels, shower shoes, batteries, snacks, and drinks.
Offerings should expand to include tee shirts, coffee mugs/portable cups, and souvenir coins
with the base name. Base-related items can have long delivery times during busy holiday
seasons. Prime RIBS should keep open standing orders to ensure those items are readily
available as gifts and souvenirs.
9.8.2. Local Culture Products. Other popular items are culturally unique products produced
or hand made in the area that can be obtained through contracts with local vendors and
suppliers (e.g., blankets, jewelry, local money, games, and snacks). Besides reselling
convenience items such as snacks, cigarettes, and toiletries purchased from AAFES stocks,
recreation resale can be a combined operation with a fitness center to sell sportswear and
sports drinks when not in conflict with AAFES efforts. Other potential resale items include
cards, darts, electronic games, board games, headphones, earbuds, and snacks (in vending
machines) near movie shelters. A cyber café with snacks and drinks near morale phones and
computers has been a successful practice.
9.8.3. NAF Resale Operations. Specific NAF resale strategies and operating considerations
can be found later in this Chapter.
9.8.4. AAFES Resale Operations. Specific AAFES resale operation types and
considerations can be found in Chapter 10, Resource Management.
9.9. Learning Resource Center. LRCs are established at contingency locations to provide
deployed members the opportunity to access informational and educational resources to continue
their professional and personal development as well as access recreational reading and viewing
material. The most valued resources at a deployed location are those that provide Airmen a sense
of normalcy despite their distance from home.
9.9.1. Location. LRCs are often located within the same facility as an education center, but
serve a different function. The LRC centralizes access to various media that promotes
professional and academic development through continued military education. The LRC gives
Airmen a diversion from the daily realities of combat by providing a variety of recreational

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
reading material ranging from best sellers to graphic novels and by providing movies and
video games. See Figure 9.1, Example LRC.

9.9.3. Deployment Phases. The deployment phases are aligned to (but not the same as) force
elements and help identify both the status of the base from an operational standpoint and the
expected resources Prime RIBS members should have available.
9.9.3.1. Prime RIBS should start planning for the buildup of LRC services as soon as
possible. Deliberate planning early in the deployment will lead to greater success in
recreation programs.
9.9.3.2. The deployed population dictates the personnel and UTC support for these
functions. Prime RIBS members and EFSS leadership are tasked with developing plans to
best use available resources to achieve mission success.
9.9.3.3. The Prime RIBS member selected to manage LRC operations typically attends
specific training at Air Force Services Center prior to deployment due to the lack of
military capability. See Table 9.4, LRC Services Based on Environment.

Table 9.4. LRC Services Based on Environment
9.9.4. Planning Considerations. Prime RIBS should expect that the major components of
the services capability for supporting the LRC will begin in sustain the base phase. While
secondary to more immediate functions such as food service and lodging, buildup for LRC
services should be provided as soon as feasible.
9.9.5. Location Type and Local Conditions. The most important feature of an LRC should
be a quiet environment conducive for studying and recreation. While collocating the LRC with
other functions may deter from a quiet environment because it creates noise and other
distractions, it is important to be close to other morale and recreational facilities. Site selection
per unified facilities criteria (refer to Unified Facilities Criteria [UFC] 4-740-20, Libraries)
suggests the following criteria when possible: locate within walking distance of base
operations, housing, shopping, and recreational facilities; facility should be easily identifiable;
and avoid noisy locations.
9.9.6. Environmental Considerations. Contact CE to conduct a safety inspection prior to
opening the LRC. Determine if there are any known environmental hazards that could restrict
operations or require theater logistics, contract, or engineering support before the facilities or
sites are usable. There may be host nation restrictions on use of certain types of facilities due
to location, environmental pollution, or other support concerns.
9.9.7. Self-Directed Activities. Prior to the establishment of an LRC, circumstances may
only allow for distribution of non-accountable items from kits (e.g., playaways, paperback
books, and magazines).
9.9.8. Available and Projected Facilities and Resources. See paragraph 9.3.8.
9.9.8.1. Modular Buildings. See paragraph 9.3.6.
9.9.8.2. As resources allow, continue to improve the atmosphere for education, learning,
recreation, and study by providing adequate quiet space. LRC facilities for sustainment
operations include but are not limited to public service areas (circulation area, collection,
reading area, quiet study areas, small group study areas); information service area
(computers); staff office area (administrative offices, supply storage, workroom staging
area for resources. See Figure 9.2, LRC Areas.

9.9.8.3. Provide for adequate entry foyers, walk-off mats, and outside wind baffles (if
needed) to prevent sand, dirt, and dust from blowing in when doors are closed if hardened
facilities are unavailable.
9.9.9. LRC Services. Services depend on the mission requirements, warfighter demand, and
available resources. An established LRC should provide core library services (e.g., reference
titles, Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) collection, test and study guides, online mission,
and academic research tools), and morale support (bestselling hard back books, paperback
books, graphic novels, DVDs, video games, access to online ebooks, audiobooks, videos).
9.9.9.1. Guidance. Libraries should be established and operated according to DAFI
34-101. Trained staffing is vital to successful operation of LRCs. All training should be
coordinated with AFSVC SVPL-LRC.
9.9.9.2. Directed Activities. LRC may provide the following services, dependent on
staffing and needs of deployed service personnel:
9.9.9.2.1. Mission support services would include library orientations or briefings to
units or organizations.
9.9.9.2.2. Education support services would provide academic support to include
library and research skills training.
9.9.9.2.3. Digital services would include CAC enabled computers, video equipment,
and other media devices.
 
 
9-14
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
9.9.9.2.4. Online access services are the provision of professional databases and other
web-based resources. Training may be provided on specific resources upon request.
9.9.9.2.5. Recreational services may encompass book clubs, language or music
lessons, and financial literacy sessions.
9.9.10. LRC Equipment. Depending on location and resources, an LRC can provide a
variety of services, ranging from a place to read to using online resources to complete
coursework or study for a Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support
(DANTES) or college-level examination program (CLEP) test. LRC support requires
telephone lines, staff, internet access, printers, large television with DVD player, and
numerous desks and workstations. LRC library services require a library workstation
dedicated to inventory control, computer lab with Internet connectivity, shelving, document
scanner, bar code scanner, copier, and library specific supplies.
9.9.10.1. Choosing Equipment. LRC resources vary based on population. Selection of
appropriate and diversified reading materials is essential and should be coordinated with
professional library staff. As resources allow, provide an assortment of desks with chairs,
lounge chairs, larger tables and chairs, and equipment for videos. When feasible, obtain
equipment from closing locations. As functions are phased in, the LRC will require
separate racks and stacks for separating the various formats of library materials.
9.9.10.2. Obtaining Equipment. Some of the equipment needed in the LRC should be
provided by AFSVC SVPL-LRC (e.g., barcode scanners, portable DVD players, and iPads
for inventory). Other equipment should be acquired by the unit (e.g., television and media
equipment).
9.9.10.3. EFSS designated officers and SNCOs are accountable for assets and should
carefully monitor them. They should take appropriate steps to obtain new equipment and
return old equipment by determining whether the organization must obtain a theater
contract or some type of contract augmentation support to maintain, repair, and replace
failing equipment. Refer to AFMAN 34-204.
9.9.11. Media Requirements. Work with the ECS to determine if prewiring can be done for
media and computer equipment. If possible, provide morale Wi-Fi access.
9.9.12. Sustain the Base Actions. Assuming a library was established early on, the bulk of
the sustainment effort is primarily centered on supporting the LRC and creating an atmosphere
for education, learning, study, and relaxation. It is imperative to provide adequate quiet spaces
for intensive reading, research, study, as well as recreational reading and DVD viewing. Work
closely with the theater or AFSVC SVPL-LRC to develop support that will be commensurate
with the location and level of service. Qualified Prime RIBS personnel at an LRC can provide
library resources, services, and access. Library resources, services, and programs provide
members the ability to obtain information through focused on-site collections, online library
connections, databases, and the Internet to satisfy recreational as well as educational research
needs.
9.9.13. Manpower requirements. LRC manpower requirements are based on the serviced
population. If the number of members served is 500 or more, one trained library specialist
(3F1) should be deployed. Prime RIBS members acting as library specialists should receive
specific training from AFSVC SVPL-LRC on library inventory control prior to deployment.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-15
 
 
Prime RIBS members trained in library operations should be of sufficient rank to equal the
high level of responsibility and should not be pulled for duty elsewhere.
9.9.14. Support Contracts. Expanding to offer full LRC services requires adequately trained
Prime RIBS personnel who can manage formal computerized library inventory management
systems, develop and manage capabilities for an online integrated library, and manage library
access, research, and professional library resource systems. Consult with Theater Services
Planners and AFSVC SVPL-LRC to determine if it is possible to transition these rotating UTC
positions into civil servants who will volunteer for long-term or annual tours to provide much
needed continuity of operations. If civilians are not available, seek an AFCAP contract for
long-term sustainment support. If seeking civilian contract support at joint service bases,
explore opportunities with sister services.
9.9.15. Maintaining Equipment. During early stages of deployment, there should not be
equipment to replace in a library unless it is substituting older paperback books with new or
different ones. As equipment (e.g., computers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, copiers,
people counters) is added and heavily used during deployment, it may need more frequent
repair and replacement than equipment at a CONUS base. This repair and replacement may be
hard to get in remote locations. To prevent rapid loss of equipment and reduce downtime,
provide more frequent service (e.g., computers, DVD players, televisions) and develop
preventive maintenance plans. Determine which types of repairs are manageable by staff
members and ensure that those staff members receive training.
9.9.16. Routine Maintenance. Prime RIBS LRC and library managers should ensure
equipment is kept clean and well maintained so that there is no interruption in service,
particularly to personnel involved in a continuing education or long-distance learning
program. Develop a schedule and have users, volunteers, or contract civilian workers routinely
check for maintenance and safety issues. Provide convenient access to trash receptacles,
quality vacuums, and other materials that users may need to assist with maintaining clean
areas and supplies. Contract support may be available for trash pickup, and other cleaning
tasks. Continuity books should identify staff training required to maintain resources and
maintenance contracts required for LRCs.
9.9.17. Repairs. When obtaining new equipment, ensure that maintenance and repair are
included as part of the purchase and keep spare parts and backups on hand for the most used
equipment. Maintain a repair log in the continuity binder. Determine whether it will be more
cost efficient to replace a piece of equipment rather than repair it and make the request to
AFSVC SVPL-LRC or unit leadership.
9.9.18. Establish an LRC. Use the following checklist as a guide for establishing and
maintaining a LRC. See Table 9.5, LRC Checklist.

9.9.19. Managing LRC Facilities and Resources. EFSS is responsible for assets under their
direct control and controlled items should be accounted for prior to transferring to gaining
units. The LRC is responsible for maintaining accountability of library assets from AFSVC
SVPL LRC. AFSVC SVPL LRC should begin shipments of library resources when a
dedicated computer is set up to register warfighters and check resources in and out of the LRC
for accurate inventory control. Keeping the LRC clean can be a concern, so if the commander
will be using contract civilian labor on site for cleaning, add the LRC.
9.9.20. LRC Funding. LRCs are funded with APFs in accordance with AFI 65-106. Activity
managers should contact Theater Services Planners and/or refer to Air Force instructions on
appropriate funding processes to implement the LRC program.
9.9.21. LRC Budgeting Forecasts. LRC support is a two-part effort that is addressed during
sustainment. While the earliest efforts to provide library support are to provide magazines and
periodicals, paperbacks and an assortment of DVDs, this function transitions from the basic
recreation side to a broader effort to support the Air Force’s educational and mission
requirements. Budget items should include computers, desks, chairs, filing systems, and
general supplies.
9.10. Nonappropriated Fund Standards and Resale Operations. Deployed MWR programs
are primarily funded with APFs. The purpose of NAFs in contingency locations is to enhance APF
funded MWR programs to increase the morale of assigned personnel through entertainment,

promotions, and resale operations. NAFs are generated from Airmen, for Airmen, and should be
used wisely and in accordance with established policy.
9.10.1. Fiscal Responsibility. Contingency locations should maintain prudent stewardship of
NAF funds and continue to operate on a breakeven or better basis. NAFs may only be spent
where needed for authorized, legitimate requirements that are not authorized from APFs, that
are not considered excessive, and that will pass audit scrutiny. All involved with approval,
budgeting, and expenditure of NAFs are charged with oversight, protection, and control to
ensure sufficient NAFs are generated to provide for authorized uses to support the Airmen,
and limit the potential for criticism of the Air Force.
9.10.2. NAF Standards. Enforcement of standards helps to prevent the misuse of funds or the
perception of misuse. NAFs are closely scrutinized and inappropriate expenditures can result
in the authority to use NAFs being rescinded. Before budgeting, approving, or expending
NAFs, ensure that: 1) funds are available; 2) funds are used to improve morale; 3) are
authorized in regulatory guidance; and 4) the expenditure passes scrutiny. The Air Force Audit
Agency and other levels of review also keep NAF operations under high visibility. This serves
as a reminder that Prime RIBS needs to ensure all plans, budgets, and operations are above
reproach.
9.10.2.1. At deployed locations, NAFs are an enhancement to an otherwise APF-funded
recreation program and should not be used as an alternate fund source in lieu of APFs.
Comptroller review (and sometimes ECES, expeditionary contracting squadron [ECONS],
and ELRS commander coordination) is required prior to consideration by approval
authority of any NAF expenditures for non-resale requirements.
9.10.3. Use of APFs. APFs are the primary funds source for Airmen regeneration. MWR is
mission critical, but it is ultimately up to the installation commander to determine how MWR
is prioritized. When using APFs to support Airmen regeneration, the items purchased should
be available to everyone and support the EFSS MWR program.
9.10.3.1. MWR operations are Category A, mission essential programs and are authorized
100 percent APF support. APFs are used to support contingency site operations
commensurate with contingency requirements. Do not use APFs to recreate or duplicate
support amenities available at established Air Force installations. When APFs are not
available for capital or operational needs for which APFs are authorized, include them as
unfunded requirements in the appropriated fund budget.
9.10.3.2. The support element containing Air Force services activities is the only
organization authorized to purchase recreation and physical fitness equipment. This
enables the EFSS to make sure only the minimum necessary MWR capability is provided
at contingency locations without any duplication of effort. It also allows economy of scale
on any purchases of equipment or services needed for operation of these activities.
9.10.3.3. APFs should be used to purchase only what is needed, prudent, and authorized.
No gold-plating (buying an overly expensive version of an item when a lesser-valued item
meets the requirement) or recreating home station amenities in accordance with AFI
65-610.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-19
 
 
9.10.3.4. If an individual item or piece of equipment is not used solely and exclusively to
generate NAF income, then it must be purchased with APFs. Some items are considered
dual use which often creates confusion regarding which fund source should be used.
EXAMPLE: A refrigerator used to store only NAF resale would be purchased with NAFs. A
refrigerator used to store only bottled water for hydration would be purchased with APFs. A
refrigerator that stores both NAF resale and bottled water for hydration is dual use and would be
purchased with APFs. The reason APFs would be used is because the refrigerator is not solely and
exclusively used to generate NAF income since it also contains free bottled water.
9.10.4. Use of NAFs. NAFs enhance MWR programming. If an item is authorized APF
support, then NAFs cannot be used. The lack of APF availability does not make NAF use
permissible.
9.10.4.1. The function supported with NAFs should be available to everyone and support
the EFSS MWR program. NAFs may not be used to support non-EFSS activities unless
specifically authorized by regulation or instruction (e.g., chaplain support).
9.10.4.2. Any item that is used solely and exclusively to generate NAF income must be
purchased with NAFs.
9.10.5. Sources of NAFs. Regardless the source of NAFs, care should be taken to ensure
proper accountability and stewardship. There are five primary sources of NAFs at contingency
locations:
9.10.5.1. Resale Operations. Where feasible, each location should operate a resale activity
to meet warfighter demand. The resale operation must comply with appropriate
procedures/guidelines as outlined in AFMAN 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial
Management and Accounting.
9.10.5.2. Unit Allocations. These are also known as per capita allocations or AAFES
dividends, and they are based on the US military assigned strength. AF/A1S provides
isolated unit allocations to Air Force contingency locations to offset QoL morale programs
that are not authorized from APF resources. Air Force personnel deployed to non-Air
Force locations should seek support from their host location.
9.10.5.3. Donations and Commercial Sponsorship. The installation commander approves
donated items and commercial sponsorship valued at $25,000 or less, and may delegate in
writing up to $5,000 in acceptance to the EFSS commander. All donated items should be
approved in advance, properly accounted for, and controlled. Donated items should be
formally accepted via a donation acceptance letter in accordance with AFMAN 34-201,
Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS) and AFI 34-108, Commercial Sponsorship and
Sale of Advertising. Commercially sponsored items obtained should be used based on the
terms of the sponsorship contract. Contact Theater Services Planners for more
information, guidance, and assistance.
9.10.5.4. Concession Income. Income from NAF concessionaire contracts where a
percentage of the revenue generated by the concessionaire is returned to the NAFI. This
also includes vendor fees and EFSS-hosted bazaars.
 
 
9-20
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
9.10.5.5. Resource, Recovery, and Recycling Program (RRRP). This program is
administered by CE, but any profits generated from the program after expenses are
deposited as NAF income for the sites that implement this program.
9.10.6. Authorized NAF Expenditures. NAFs may be used to support authorized MWR
entertainment and promotion programs. Event and tournament prizes (e.g., card games,
bingo), talent shows, and game show programming are examples of authorized NAF
expenditures.
9.10.6.1. Participation Awards. Participation awards not to exceed $15 per person
participating. Gift cards may not be used as participation awards. T-shirts for fun run,
prizes for sports competitions, or any other non-intramural fitness events are also
authorized NAFs. Rules of engagement should be sent to Theater Services Planners for
review to ensure NAFs are used appropriately and to share with other contingency
locations.
9.10.6.2. Complimentary Consumables. Complimentary consumables provided at no
charge (e.g., coffee, pizza, snacks) can be purchased with NAFs to entice warfighters to
participate in MWR activities. Items such as napkins, paper plates, and coffee cups are also
purchased with NAFs. Free popcorn can also be offered. The popcorn, oil, flavorings, and
bags should be purchased with NAFs. The popcorn popper would be procured with APFs.
9.10.6.3. Resale and Income Generation Activities. Authorized examples of resale and
income generation activities include (but not necessarily limited to):
• Slushy machines and supplies.
• Specialty coffee bars.
• Resale items (e.g., coins, t-shirts, sundries).
9.10.6.4. Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies used to support resale
operations (e.g., refrigerators, cash registers, cups, and straws).
9.10.6.5. Parties/Picnics. Parties and picnics open to all assigned personnel to include
beginning, mid-point, and end-of-tour parties, major holiday events/special events, and
host country armed forces commemoration parties.
9.10.6.6. Base-wide activities (e.g., sport’s day, fun runs) that are not held on a recurring
basis
NOTE: NAFs may not be used to support activities that are not hosted/conducted by EFSS.
9.10.6.7. Prizes. Door prizes with a value not to exceed $15 per person. Gift cards cannot
be used for door prizes.
9.10.6.8. Decorations. Decorations for US federal holidays and equivalent level holidays
of the host country, decorations should be purchased with APFs in accordance with
DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1. For all other events, decorations may be purchased with
NAFs. Costumes worn by participants, (e.g., Halloween best dressed, costume parties,
talent contests) are not considered decorations and are not an authorized NAF expense.
They should be paid for by the participants. This does not include items such as Santa or
elf suits.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-21
 
 
9.10.6.9. Entertainment Support (Drinks and Mementos). Non-alcoholic beverages (e.g.,
soft drinks, juice, Gatorade®) may be provided to entertainers during the setup,
performance, and tear-down. NAFs may also be used to provide a memento to the group in
recognition of their performance. This memento should be conservative in cost. Coins or
T-shirts are recommended.
9.10.6.10. Entertainment and Recreational Events. Includes entertainment and
recreational events conducted at contingency locations which may seem fitness related,
but should be funded with NAFs. Some examples include Biggest Loser contests, sports
days, and special event fun runs that are not held on a recurring basis (i.e., a special event
held in conjunction with a holiday like a Turkey Trot or Jingle Bell Run).
9.10.6.11. Special Purpose Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Funds. SM&W expenditures
are NAF expenditures from the installation’s NAFI that are considered necessary to
contribute to the overall morale and welfare of the military community. Be mindful not to
confuse SM&W with official representation funds (ORF) which are used to extend official
courtesies to certain officials and dignitaries of the United States and foreign countries.
Protocol is primarily responsible for the use of ORFs.
9.10.6.11.1. SM&W requests require installation commander approval in writing prior
to expenditure. The installation commander may delegate, in writing, the authority to
approve recurring functions (e.g., change of command, recognition programs,
welcoming and orientation). There are no regulatory requirements regarding to whom
the authority may be delegated, but it is most often the EFSS commander.
9.10.6.11.2. If the installation commander delegates approval authority for recurring
functions, the delegation letter should specify not only the individual delegated to but
also the monetary limits to which those functions can be supported.
9.10.6.11.3. The installation commander must approve all non-recurring functions in
writing. This authority cannot be delegated.
9.10.6.11.4. The NAF custodian should have a prepared brief that identifies what
functions and items are authorized SM&W support. Any requests for SM&W should
be presented to the NAF custodian before the formal request process begins. This
permits the NAF Custodian to provide assistance to the requestor and verify the
request is authorized SM&W support. Reimbursement of approved expenditures is
recommended as the requestor can provide receipts. With high volume turnovers at
contingency locations this limits the NAFI having outstanding funds where change and
receipts should be provided or returned. The local finance office should review all
requests prior to approval to determine if APFs are authorized.
9.10.6.11.5. A sample request for SM&W can be found in AFI 34-201, Attachment 7.
Whether the request is in letter format, email, or staff summary sheet is a local
decision. The request should contain all the information needed for inclusion in the
SM&W quarterly report.
9.10.6.11.6. Quarterly SM&W Reports are prepared by the NAF accounting office,
signed by the installation commander, and forwarded to the servicing NAF accountant
office no later than 45 days after the end of the quarter. Desired expenditures not
 
 
9-22
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
explicitly covered here or by other Air Force directives should be coordinated with and
approved by Theater Services Planners.
9.10.7. Operating Instructions. OIs should be developed and enforced for the various MWR
programs. A copy of each OI should be provided to the Theater Service Planner for review.
9.10.8. Programming. Theater services planners have access to numerous programming
tools to assist in developing site-specific Airmen regeneration programs. Rules and marketing
are provided with each event. It should be noted that these off the shelf programs may be
designed for CONUS bases. It is imperative to adapt the suggestions to the restrictions of the
contingency location.
9.10.9. Games of Chance. For events where awards will be given for participation,
participants should be required to sign up in advance, and they should participate in the event
prior to receiving the participation award. There will be no poker games or activities in
accordance with AFI 34-101, but Texas Hold’em tournaments are authorized. Texas Hold’em
tournaments at contingency locations offered free of charge are not gambling. The participants
are never asked to put any of their own funds at risk or pay to play.
9.10.10. Volunteers. Other organizations and personnel may volunteer to assist the EFSS in
hosting events. This volunteer assistance should be without any benefits to the organization or
the individual.
9.10.11. Non-unit Organizations. NAFs may not be used to support non-unit organization
events (e.g., Top III, fire department, sexual assault response coordinator [SARC], and
security forces). These functions may use EFSS facilities, but this support does not authorize
the use of NAFs.
9.10.12. Authorized Participants. See paragraph 8.4.3.5 Authorized Personnel.
9.10.13. Life of the Deployment File (Continuity Binders). See paragraph 8.4.17
Continuity and Table 8.7, Example Continuity Binder Tabs.
9.10.14. Life of the Fund File. See Table 8.7, Example Continuity Binder Tabs.
9.10.15. Commercial Sponsorship. According to AFI 34-108, commercial sponsorship
refers to the act of a civilian enterprise providing support to help finance or provide
enhancements for MWR elements of services activities, events, and programs in exchange for
promotional consideration and access to the Air Force market for a limited period of time.
Support may take the form of goods, cash, or services.”
9.10.15.1. Commercial sponsorship support has two primary benefits:
• It provides funding support to supplement programming.
• It enables industry to show their support for deployed forces.
9.10.15.2. To maximize the benefit of commercial sponsorship, Prime RIBS activity
managers should periodically review their programming calendars and identify programs
that lend themselves to commercial sponsorship. Events that traditionally receive the most
support are programs that bring a large number of base personnel together (e.g., fun runs,
sports days) to maximize sponsor exposure. Typically, t-shirts or water bottles are
requested from the sponsor to support the MWR event. If t-shirts or other clothing items
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-23
 
 
are requested, the EFSS should obtain the approval of the site commander to wear the
t-shirts or other clothing if civilian clothing wear is not already permitted.
9.10.16. Spend Plans. A NAF requirements budget known as a spend plan is completed
annually. The spend plan is completed by each deployed NAFI or unit fund and submitted to
the Theater Services Planner and/or servicing NAF accountant office for an entire fiscal year.
The intent of NAF programming is to offer recreational activities that encourage Airmen to
participate in fun and relaxing activities that improve their QoL while deployed. The spend
plan is the budgeting tool used to identify the requirements necessary to support NAF
programming. It is requirements-based in that it is used to forecast recreational and
entertainment events (requirements) and the associated expenditures for each requirement for
each month of the fiscal year.
9.10.16.1. Each fiscal quarter on the spend plan is stand-alone meaning the NAFs
forecasted in a given quarter do not roll-over to the next quarter. Projected income on the
spend plan is developed based on historical NAFI revenue. Once the unit has completed
the spend plan, it should be approved by the AEW commander (air expeditionary group
[AEG] commander if applicable) prior to final submission to Theater Services Planners.
9.10.16.2. Each requirement listed on the spend plan should describe the frequency of the
event, anticipated number of participants, and number/cost of prizes to be awarded.
EXAMPLE: A description from a spend plan for X number games for the month is: “Name of
Event: 16 games a month, approximately 25 participants at each game, 16 x total prizes per game
$75 (1st place $50; 2nd $25, 3rd $0) = $1,200.”
9.10.17. NAF Unprogrammed Expenditures. There may be instances where the spend plan
for a specific quarter needs to be adjusted due to unforeseen circumstances. Any NAF
unprogrammed expenditures for non-resale requirements (i.e., out-of-cycle NAF requirements
that were not included on the approved spend plan) requires written approval. The written
out-of-cycle approval must be submitted to the Theater Services Planner. To streamline this
process, Theater Services Planners can delegate in writing the authority to approve
unprogrammed expenditures of NAFs under $49,999 as follows:
• The local EFSS commander is authorized to approve unprogrammed requirements up to
$4,999.
• The local EMSG commander is authorized to approve unprogrammed requirements
from $5,000 to $9,999.
• The local AEW commander (AEG commander as applicable) is authorized to approve
unprogrammed requirements from $10,000 to $49,999.
• Theater services planners must approve all unprogrammed requirements $50,000 and
greater. Theater services planner coordination is required prior to spending local NAFs for
capital requirements costing $50,000 or more.
9.10.17.1. Once any unprogrammed NAF expenditure is completed, the spend plan
should be updated to reflect the expenditure and submitted to the Theater Services Planner.
A copy of all approvals made in accordance with delegations should be provided to the
Theater services planner. Copies of any such delegations are filed in the life of the fund
(LOF) file and sent to the Theater Services Planner.
 
 
9-24
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
9.10.18. Daily Program Activity Reports (DPAR). Each NAFI should maintain DPARs for
24 months either in the NAF custodian office or in the facility which the game is hosted. This
is a local decision. All activity managers that award any type of NAF prizes are responsible for
compiling the required information in the DPAR and sending a copy to the NAF custodian and
other leadership as required. The person awarding NAF prizes to participants should ask the
winning member for their CAC to gather the information to complete the DPAR. Information
entered on the DPAR should be transcribed exactly as the data is shown on the CAC. Once all
information has been entered on the DPAR, the winning member signs for the NAF prize.
9.10.18.1. The NAF custodian verifies the DPAR is legible and accurate. Monthly review
of DPARs should be accomplished by the unit to validate the success of programming
efforts and, if indicated, to modify the programming such that it meets warfighter demand.
9.10.19. NAF Prize Policies. When publicizing recreational events or activities, do not
advertise prize amounts and instead indicate prizes will be awarded. Consider limiting the
number of times winners may win in succession.
9.10.19.1. Gift cards for prizes should be limited to reduce the possibility of individuals
accumulating a sizeable number of gift cards. This accumulation can border on supporting
personal purchases or expenses, which are not authorized. A good practice is to provide
prizes that tie to the event (e.g., collapsible pool cues for pool tournaments). Gift cards
should be maintained in the NAF custodian’s safe and issued out using a locally developed
form (e.g., Gift Card Request Form).
9.10.19.2. Winners of team prizes split the prize among team members. The below prize
limits are the recommended maximum prize values based on the health of the NAFI. Not
all programs have to award the maximum prize. With good programming, offering
differing prize values based on the acceptance of the program can generate additional
enthusiasm. This practice also enables the activity to offer the same programs as a special
event with a higher prize to generate excitement.
9.10.19.3. Prizes are distributed based on local preference (individuals or teams). The
prize can be offered to the 1st place winner, 1st to 3rd place winners, or any other
combination. The specified dollar value for prizes based on the number of participants
cannot be exceeded. Activity managers should cancel any event with less than four people
or teams signed up to participate.
9.10.19.4. Prime RIBS activity managers should make a reasonable effort to offer creative
prizes that are program related, not available at the site, or are unique to the location.
9.10.19.5. The prized may be a combination of program-related items along with a gift
card with the total value not to exceed the prize limit.
EXAMPLE: The prize for the winner of a billiards tournament with 18 participants is a $75 pool
stick plus a $25 gift card.
9.10.19.6. Recommended Limits Based on Headcount for Non-Progressive Events. See
Table 9.6, Non-Progressive Prize Allocation (Excluding Bingo) for prize limits based on
headcounts for all non-progressive events excluding Bingo. Event examples include pool
tournaments, card games, board games, ping pong, foosball, trivia contests, TV game
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022

shows, scavenger hunts, darts, horseshoes, video games, dominoes, chess, checkers, air
hockey, and sumo wrestling.
Table 9.6. Non-Progressive Prize Allocation (Excluding Bingo)
9.10.19.7. Recommended Limits Based on Headcount for Progressive Events. A
progressive event is described as an event where there are elimination rounds over a period
of time and all prizes are awarded at the culmination (end) of the event. The number of
elimination rounds and the period of time between eliminations is a local decision.
AFCENT/A1S must approve new progressive elimination competition events in advance.
See Table 9.7, Progressive Prize Allocation (Excluding Bingo)
NOTE: No prizes should be awarded that exceeds $575 regardless of number of participants.
Table 9.7. Progressive Prize Allocation (Excluding Bingo)
9.10.19.8. Recommended Prize Limits for Non-Progressive Bingo. Regardless of the
number of participants (eight minimum to play), all regular bingo prizes should be
distributed in an ascending manner with the final game prize not to exceed $50.00. Prime
RIBS activity managers adjust actual prizes to event participation. To make each regular
bingo game more interesting, mix up straight bingo with other types of bingo (e.g.,
4-corners, postage stamp-any corner, block of nine, 6-pack, blackout). All bingo game
winning cards should be validated by the winner, another bingo participant, and a member
of the recreation center staff. See Table 9.8, Example Non-Progressive Bingo Sessions.

prize for progressive Bingo should be $300.00. Progressive Bingo starts with 52 called
numbers and increases by one number each time played until a blackout bingo occurs. If a
blackout bingo does not occur on or before the predetermined sequential progressive
number, a consolation prize not to exceed $100 may be awarded to the first person to
black-out bingo. All bingo game winning cards should be validated by the winner, another
bingo participant, and a member of the recreation center staff. See Table 9.9, Progressive

Table 9.9. Progressive Bingo Example
9.10.20. Contracts. Since there are no deployed NAF contracting officers, the local ECONS
provides all of the contracting support.
9.10.20.1. Tickets and Tours. There is a difference in a tour and a recreation trip.
Recreation trips are considered a personal expense (e.g., shopping trips, horseback riding,
golf), and they may not be subsidized with NAFs. Tours are sightseeing events that are
cultural or educational in nature. Typically, a tour would involve having a professional
tour guide providing insight into the local area. With AEW commander approval, NAFs
may be used to minimally offset the cost of some tours.
9.10.20.2. Maximum offset of tours should not exceed $10 per tour. The offset of
sightseeing tours should be included in the NAF spend plan and be approved in writing by
the AEW commander. Offset requests should be coordinated with Theater Service
Planners and/or the servicing NAF accountant office prior to submission to the installation
commander. Tours should not be subsidized if the NAFI is showing a year to date loss.
• Tours up to $40 may be offset $5.
Scenario:
Game 6 is identified and announced to the crowd as a progressive bingo event. Since this is the 
first time progressive bingo has been played at the deployed location, it will have 52 called 
numbers. To win the progressive bingo event, a member must get a black-out on the bingo card. 
If a member wins bingo on or before the 52 called numbers, they receive the prize not to exceed 
$300. 
If there is no bingo on or before the 52 called numbers, continue to call numbers until a bingo is 
declared, but the winner should only receive the consolation prize. 
The next time progressive bingo is offered, 53 called numbers will be played, and the called 
numbers will continually increase by one number each progressive bingo played until there is a 
winner declared. 
Once a winner is declared, the process starts over and the next progressive bingo will have 52 
called numbers. The numbers called in support of the progressive bingo event must be identified 
on the daily program activity report (DPAR). Below is an example of progressive bingo with an 
ascending prize value:

• Tours over $40 may be offset $10.
• No offset for tours costing $10 or less.
9.10.20.3. Participants in recreation trips and tours should pay in advance. Do not pay the
vendor for late cancellations and no shows and then provide refunds to the participants.
The NAFI’s refund policy should mirror that of the company. If the NAFI has to pay the
vendor, no refunds should be provided to the participant. Personnel should be briefed on
these rules prior to them signing up and paying for the tours. If necessary, have them read
and sign the policy on cancellations and refunds.
9.10.21. Resale Considerations. At locations where a NAFI or unit fund is established, sites
have the capability to generate NAF revenue from resale operations to provide for enhanced
MWR programming. Ensure that these resale operations are available to customers based on
participation and demand.
9.10.21.1. Resale items should not be dated or single out a specific rotation, event, or
special day because it limits the customer base and restricts sales to a particular date and
time (i.e., Valentine’s Day t-shirts, EFSS coins).
9.10.21.2. Resale items should not be purchased for sale to a restricted group. Agencies
may request the EFSS to purchase items for them as long as they pre-pay in advance of the
items being ordered for them.
9.10.21.3. Restocking of inventory should be done with sufficient lead-time to ensure
continuance of a viable resale operation to include crossing over AFFORGEN rotations. It
is the responsibility of the outgoing AFFORGEN team to ensure orders are placed so that
there is no gap in receiving stock for the incoming AFFORGEN team.
9.10.21.4. Tips should not be permitted in EFSS NAF resale operations.
9.10.21.5. Cash refunds cannot be given out through the Eagle Cash system in EFSS
activities.
9.10.22. Alcohol Operations. If a site is authorized to sell alcoholic beverages, they must
comply with all provisions of DAFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program. Any local policies
set forth by component commanders, installation commanders, or any unit commander must
be published in a supplement to AFI 34-219. Some of the provisions are listed below (list not
all inclusive):
9.10.22.1. One alcoholic beverage drink equals one of the following: 12 ounces of beer,
1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, or 5 ounces of wine. These are standard serving sizes and
should not be increased.
9.10.22.2. At deployed locations where foreign beer is offered that exceeds the standard
12 ounces, the site commander must be consulted to verify it is acceptable within the site’s
alcohol rationing program.
9.10.22.3. All alcohol resale operations must have an OI that prohibits serving alcoholic
beverages to individuals who appear intoxicated or close to being intoxicated (Dram Shop
Theory).
9.10.22.4. Military personnel 18 years or older may purchase, serve, sell, possess, and
consume alcoholic beverages outside the United States, its territories, and possessions
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
9-29
 
 
unless a higher drinking-age requirement exists in accordance with applicable status of
forces or country-to-country agreements.
9.10.22.5. A higher drinking age requirement may also be imposed based on the local
situation as determined by the installation commander or the senior on-site unit
commander when there is no installation commander.
9.10.22.6. Awarding of coupons for reduced prices on alcoholic beverages is not
authorized
9.10.22.7. Drinking contests are not allowed.
9.10.22.8. Only NAF activities are authorized to sell alcohol.
9.10.22.9. Inventory must be secured, controlled, and documented in accordance with
applicable Air Force guidance. Alcohol inventory must be counted and documented at the
close of each month or as deemed necessary by the EFSS commander to maintain
operational control. It is highly recommended to conduct daily/shift inventories.
9.10.22.10. Costs of goods should be carefully calculated and monitored. Ensure
appropriate pricing is accomplished on alcoholic beverage products to avoid potential
criticism for perceived glamorization of alcohol and to sustain sufficient revenues.
9.10.23. Cost of Sales and Pricing Strategies. It is important to understand cost of sales
which is the costs directly related to the items sold in the resale operation. In the NAF resale
operation, cost of sales is the cost of not only the item purchased but also any associated costs
(i.e., shipping and handling, design fees). Cost of sales can be depicted as a percentage. Do not
sell the items for less than they cost. Net sales minus cost of sales equal gross profit from sales.
See Table 9.10, Example Cost of Sales Calculation.
Table 9.10. Example Cost of Sales Calculation
9.10.23.1. Pricing Strategies. Pricing strategies should be considered when determining
not only the sales pricing for an individual item but the overall menu mix.
Sales—GLAC 3010000$25,723.45
Beginning Inventory—GLAC 4010001 plus 
Purchases—GLAC 4010000 plus 
Ending Inventory—GLAC 4010002 minus 
Cost of Sales (COS) 
$25,904.40
$12,106.10
($23,043.89)
$14,966.61
Formula expressed in percentage
COS / Sales = COS percent
$14,966.61 / $25,723.45 = 58.18 percent Cost of Sales is 58 percent
Gross profit on sales would be sales minus cost of sales
(Sales) $25,723.45—(COS) 14,966.61 = (Gross profit) $10,756.84

9.10.23.2. To achieve the desired profit percentage, some items can be marked up a small
percentage (i.e., candy costing $.95 and selling for $1.00), while some items can be
marked a higher percentage (i.e., coins costing $2.75 selling for $5.00, T-shirts costing
$7.50 and selling for $10.00).
9.10.23.3. Below are some items to consider when determining sales prices:
• What will the market bear—price versus perception of value.
• Market desires—what do customers want and can it be provided to them?
• Overall menu mix is determined by product mix—what are the best sellers, what
does that product cost? Should best sellers have the highest/lowest cost of sales
(COS)?
• Dealing with dead stock—what are some strategies to remove dead stock? Consider
transfer to prizes or food items to complimentary.
• Increasing sales prices—try to increase the middle number. $7.45 to $7.65 is less
noticeable to warfighters.
9.10.23.4. Determining the appropriate sales price for resale items is vital to achieving a
cost of sales goal and supporting Airmen regeneration. There are two variables that should
be considered before establishing the sales price for an individual item.
• AAFES. The EFSS can never sell an item for the same or less cost than AAFES, so
the sales price will always be higher than AAFES for the same individual item.
• Nickel Increments. Sales prices should always be rounded up to the nearest nickel.
9.10.23.5. AAFES Discount to the NAFI. Exchange Operating Procedure (EOP) 40-35,
Organizational/Activity Sales, states most NAF purchases (not the gift cards) from AAFES
are authorized a 10 percent discount. Prime RIBS personnel making NAF purchases may
need to be identified in a letter from the EFSS commander to AAFES. To assist AAFES in
ensuring they have adequate stocks to meet requirements, Prime RIBS personnel should
forecast requirements in advance and in writing. Prime RIBS should coordinate with
AAFES to determine how far in advance requirements need to be identified. Copies of
these requirements should be filed locally for future reference. EFSS leadership should
conduct a quarterly review to ensure their activities are taking advantage of AAFES
discounts and utilizing lowest cost vendors.
9.10.23.6. Four Steps to Compute Sales Price:
• Step 1: Determine the cost of an individual item or unit.
• Step 2: Determine the sales percentage goal or percentage of profit.
• Step 3: Take 100 percent minus the sales percentage goal (step 2) and that gives you
the cost of sales. Then take the cost of item and divide by cost of sales percentage (step
3).
• Step 4: Round to the nearest nickel or dollar.

Chapter 10
CH10 RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
10.1. Introduction. Prime RIBS members should be prepared to deploy to support mission
requirements that span the globe. This is an informational in-the-field reference resource that
provides Prime RIBS members the information to make independent decisions based on proven
TTP for APF and NAF resource management, contracting operations, and AAFES. The first call
for support outside of this TTP should be to the supporting MAJCOM, NAF, or component
Services Planner (referred to as Theater Planner).
10.1.1. Prime RIBS. Expenditures to support contingency operations include essential life
supporting functions and QoL enhancements for lodging, feeding, laundry, recreation and
fitness, field exchanges, and learning resource center support. QoL efforts are proven to be
extremely important for supporting the well-being and performance of deployed warfighters.
Even though some QoL efforts have been perceived as excessive, follow-up has shown that
most efforts led to improved support for deployed personnel. Some commander-directed
efforts placed undue pressure to use appropriated and nonappropriated resources questionably.
10.1.2. General Accounting Office (GAO). This committee was tasked by Congress to
examine contingency costs and expenditures that occurred during the 10 years after the
Persian Gulf War. The GAO report (GAO-02-450) identified how funds were used and that
there were questionable expenditures, limited guidance, and lack of oversight when providing
deployed personnel support. Many expenditures were perceived as questionable simply
because they were not readily auditable. Deployment records and procedures were often
inadequate and resulted in failures to develop and maintain adequate justification for many of
the purchases. There was a lack of clear-cut, coordinated guidance resulting in too many
interpretations of the procedures.
10.1.3. Initial Beddown Operations. During initial beddown operations for a contingency
location (i.e., open the base), the focus will be on operational reporting, receipt or deployment
of WRM, and initiating all financial management and accounting procedures. Contingency
procedures are typically employed during the initial few weeks of operations. Airmen tasked
to deploy to a location during the operate the base and sustain the base phases could be
maintaining the existing base, upgrading to more permanent facilities and services,
transitioning it for turn over to another entity, or reconstituting or redeploying prior to turning
the location back to the host nation.
10.1.4. Enduring Locations. Most of the management efforts should rely on simplified
procurement, asset tracking methods, standard accounting procedures, and budget forecasting.
These procedures are typically initiated for someone else to maintain or complete or inherited
from what someone else created. Force support leaders, various other expeditionary fund and
property managers, and custodians should consider the typical financial accounting,
budgeting, and reporting requirements (i.e., those completed for daily, weekly, monthly,
yearly). They should consider rotations that may create additional accounting, budgeting, and
reporting requirements or create shifts in some reporting dates.
10.2. Appropriated Fund Resource Management. This section provides TTP for expenditures
at deployed locations (e.g., administrative, general support, and quality of life expenditures). It
describes requirements for spending APF on items attributable to the deployment of forces to
 
 
10-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
regions where contingency operations are underway and spending APFs on incremental costs
incurred at home stations in support of such operations. Department of Defense Financial
Management Regulation (DOD FMR), 7000.14-R, Volume 12, Special Accounts, Funds, and
Programs, Chapter 23, Contingency Operations contains additional guidance on contingency
operations budgeting, spending, reporting, and reimbursement processes that apply to all DOD
components. References to relevant guidance in other Air Force and DOD publications are
provided when applicable.
10.2.1. Roles and Responsibilities. APF management practices should meet high levels of
stewardship, accountability, appropriateness, and propriety, and provide a clear audit trail,
especially for QoL issues. Contingency APF dollars have been treated as an unlimited
resource, leading to poor cost and purchase oversight. Focus should be on applied resource
management, including sound planning, budgeting, inventory, and audit (historical and
continuity) practices.
10.2.1.1. Airmen, commanders, directors, and civilian employees should ensure all
activities that prepare, justify, or execute (i.e., carry out) Air Force appropriated funds
requirements, (including Air Force business areas of the Defense Working Capital Fund)
will:
10.2.1.2. Approve and use funds only for purposes authorized by Congress.
10.2.1.3. Program, budget, and administer appropriated funds in accordance with guiding
policy.
10.2.1.4. Determine funding priorities, approve execution and spend plans, and ensure
funding resources are allocated and executed in a legal, effective, and efficient manner.
10.2.1.5. Commanders should ensure all expenditures are accurately documented and
correctly reflected in summary logs or designated financial systems.
10.2.1.6. Commanders and deployed personnel are responsible for ensuring all purchases
are necessary, prudent, and limited to those needed to support deployed mission
operations.
10.3. Resource Management Guidance. Funding guidance in AFIs are based upon law,
legislation, GAO opinions, Office of the Secretary of Defense regulations, and corporate Air
Force guidance. They are applicable to funds directly appropriated to the Air Force, funds
received from DOD transfer accounts (e.g., overseas contingency operations transfer funds), or
other accounts from which Congress has authorized the transfer of funds.
10.3.1. Use of Appropriated Funds. Appropriated funds are used to support contingency
site operations. APF purchase items (e.g., furnishings, recreation equipment, supplies) to
establish amenities commensurate with contingency requirements. Do not use APF to recreate
or duplicate support amenities available at established Air Force installations.
10.3.2. Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Funding Rules. Guidance for contingency
operations occurring outside the United States is found in AFI 32-1020, Planning and
Programming Built Infrastructure Projects.
10.3.3. Funds Transfer. Funds from a transfer account or from another account pursuant to
transfer authority are subject to the rules governing the account to which they are transferred.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-3
 
 
Before obligating transferred funds, consult with FM personnel or the staff judge advocate
(SJA). All personnel charged with the expenditure of regular APF or transfer funds are bound
by existing regulations and appropriations laws regardless of funding availability or source.
10.3.3.1. Expenditures are reviewed to ensure they meet a bona fide need (purpose, time,
and amount), the proper line of accounting is used, and dollar thresholds are not exceeded.
The absence of a prohibition on a specific use of APF at deployed locations does not
constitute authority to use them.
10.3.3.2. Approval of Expenditures. Commanders or approval authorities should consult
the appropriate SJA, FM, and the component Theater Services Planner if they are
uncertain regarding the propriety of a proposed expenditure. Deployed personnel must
avoid expenditures or procurement actions that violate applicable laws, rules or ethical
standards or create the appearance of impropriety, loss of impartiality, or self-dealing.
Commanders should review expenditures to determine if there is a violation.
10.3.4. Internal Controls. Commanders should ensure that all expenditures are properly
documented in sufficient detail to assure the propriety of the expenditure and provide an
adequate audit trail. Commanders set the tone for positive internal controls and financial
managers provide oversight assistance. Records of APF use should include purchase
summaries, purchase justifications, and expanded descriptions.
10.3.5. Asset Control and Accounting. EFSS commanders and Prime RIBS managers
should be aware of the appropriate levels of asset control and accounting and create a visible
audit trail. Use the established procedures to document purchases and expenditures. For
purchases involving morale-enhancing supplies and services, provide thorough supporting
documents clearly identifying the items and reasonableness of the expenditures.
10.3.6. Commander Roles and Responsibilities. The EFSS commander’s management
oversight is accomplished as follows in Table 10.1, Commander Roles and Responsibilities.
 
 
10-4
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Table 10.1. Commander Roles and Responsibilities
10.3.7. Resource Managers (RM). To maintain separation and control, and where local
conditions or manpower make it possible, the EFSS commander should appoint separate APF
and NAF RMs.
10.3.7.1. RM positions are responsible for financial and functional responsibility; they
ensure that the policies and procedures regarding funds use and management are followed
and performed.
10.3.7.2. The RM positions are the primary liaison with the deployed FM functions.
While deployed, the RMs comply with budget and funding methods and procedures to the
maximum extent possible given the status of the deployment.
10.3.7.3. During deployment, the FM will be one of the key players, along with the
contingency contracting office (CCO), in determining (through Secretary of the Air Force
[SAF] /FM) what waivers have been issued for resource management and fund control.
10.3.7.4. Force support RMs should be identified as the primary RM, alternate RM, and
fund custodians.
10.3.7.5. When designated, trained, and appointed by the CCO, the RMs may function as
purchase order buyers for the CCO within a stated level of authority. The RMs provide
oversight (direction and assistance) for all assets utilized in the EFSS.
10.3.7.6. The APF RM has the largest property listing and would normally be the SNCO
within the RM function. The APF RM also serves as the APF Funds Custodian (APF FC),
but may delegate responsibilities in writing as necessary to manage this large program.
• Appoints appropriated fund (APF) equipment and vehicle account custodians to logistics
readiness (LR) supply and vehicles.
• Approves the establishment of APF (including war reserve materiel [WRM]), NAF, and
Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) accounts. Appoints property managers
(for WRM), activity managers, and property account custodians.
• Appoints the APF resource managers.
• Appoints the APF property manager.
• Appoints a vehicle control officer for WRM and APF vehicles.
• Files an annual property certification.
• Ensures that each activity manager submits appropriate budgets requesting acquisition of
property.
• Reviews an annual statement of assurance that internal controls are in place and functioning
satisfactorily.
• Approves the organizational pilferable listing of property items.
• Appoints personnel to conduct impartial equipment inventories.
• Appoints personnel to conduct inquiries and investigate property losses.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-5
 
 
10.3.7.6.1. APF account records are maintained in safeguarded files for the period of
the deployment. This parallel APF file is referred to as the life of the deployment
(LOD) file.
10.3.7.6.2. The APF FC maintains the LOD file. The file extends from initial
beddown to Air Force withdrawal from the location (i.e., transfer, redeployment, or
reconstitution).
10.4. Purchases. Office and lodging furnishings should be procured in minimum quantities with
functional and durable quality. Financial managers review accounting systems to ensure funds are
available before ordering the furnishings.
10.4.1. Recreational Equipment. The expenditure of Air Force operations and maintenance
(3400) and other procurement (3080) funds directly appropriated to the Air Force are
authorized for recreational MWR equipment at contingency locations.
10.4.1.1. Funds specifically designated for contingency operations and provided to the Air
Force from transfer accounts are only available to procure recreational MWR equipment if
the Air Force budget request for those funds identified the equipment as a requirement.
10.4.1.2. Recreational equipment acquired under this provision is required to be free of
charge to the user and accessible to most, if not all, deployed personnel at the contingency
location.
10.4.1.3. It cannot be located in individual offices or quarters.
10.4.1.4. Recreational equipment used to generate revenues is purchased with
non-appropriated funds.
10.4.2. Procurement of Recreation and Physical Fitness Equipment. The support element
containing Air Force Services activities is the only organization authorized to purchase
recreation and physical fitness equipment. Non-services activity units are prohibited from
procuring recreation and physical fitness equipment. This provision also applies to televisions,
digital versatile discs, and compact disc players procured with appropriated funds for
recreational or fitness purposes.
10.4.3. Serving Materials. Serving materials (e.g., plates, dishes, utensils), other than those
procured by services for use in a dining facility (fixed structure, transportable, or van), are
only authorized for procurement by protocol offices.
10.4.3.1. Only protocol offices at MAJCOMs, NAFs, field operating agencies (FOA),
direct reporting units (DRU), Air Logistics Complex (ALC), product centers, and Air
University having conference facilities with the capacity, décor, and equipment to host
conferences such as Corona, General Officer Orientation, Retired General Officer’s
Summit, or significant foreign defense delegations.
10.4.3.2. Air Force-wide functional conferences or other large and significant
conferences, may procure the minimum serving materials necessary to serve snacks and
refreshments.
10.4.3.3. A coffee maker for the conference facility maybe purchased with appropriated
funds if its sole use is for conferences and not day-to-day use in any individual office.
 
 
10-6
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
10.4.3.4. The authority to procure these serving materials does not extend to base level
protocol offices that may only procure disposable serving materials or borrow materials
from the clubs as may be required for a conference.
10.4.3.5. Serving materials procured under this authority are charged to direct Air Force
operations and maintenance appropriations. Do not code purchase of serving materials by
the protocol office as emergency and special program (ESP) costs.
10.4.4. Standard Information Technology Office Equipment. This equipment is procured
for a contingency site using appropriated funds for contingency operations, if authorized and
available, and should remain at that site for rotating units to use.
10.4.4.1. In order to minimize duplicate purchases, each successive deploying unit will
not procure such equipment specifically for its deployment unless the equipment becomes
obsolete or irreparable.
10.4.4.2. Mission specific information technology equipment and accessories should
accompany the unit when deploying and return with it on redeployment.
10.4.4.3. Personal information technology accessories should only be procured for
personnel requiring such accessories for mission accomplishment and not merely as a
convenience.
10.4.4.4. Such accessories should remain at the contingency site for rotating personnel
and not taken home as personal equipment. They remain government property without
regard to where they are being used.
10.4.5. Holiday Observances. Installation commanders approve the use of appropriated
funds to purchase seasonal decorations on a case-by-case basis. Purchase decorations only
where all installation personnel may benefit from their use, (e.g., a decorated headquarters
building, Thanksgiving/Christmas decorations for the installation main dining facilities, base
Christmas tree, or decorated foyer of the headquarters building).
10.4.5.1. Do not use appropriated funds to purchase decorations for the interior of
government offices or for personal use.
10.4.5.2. The decorations may not be religious in character.
10.4.5.2.1. Do not use appropriated funds to purchase or mail seasonal greeting cards.
10.4.5.2.2. The commander should avoid extravagance or the appearance thereof, as
well as ensure appropriate sensitivity to host nation and local customs.
10.4.5.2.3. Items for chapel programs and events should be procured in accordance
with DAFI 52-105, Chaplain Corps Resourcing.
10.5. Government Purchase Card (GPC) Purchases. Purchases using a GPC are subject to the
same laws, Congressional direction, and DOD guidance as those made with other funding
mechanisms.
10.5.1. Air Force Guidance. GPC use in support of contingency and exercise operations is
found in AFI 64-117, Government Purchase Card Program. If a purchase is prohibited or
questionable using other procurement methods, it remains prohibited or questionable even if
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-7
 
 
the GPC is used. The GPC is simply an additional procurement vehicle to obtain goods and
services, not additional authority.
10.5.2. CCO. Only warranted CCOs are authorized to use the GPC in support of contingency
and exercise operations. Purchases made with the GPC should be made in accordance with the
guidance found in AFI 64-117 and AFI 64-105, Contingency Contracting Support.
10.6. Awards and Gifts. Authorized uses of appropriated funds for awards and gifts are limited.
Gifts to foreign officials and officers should be given in accordance with AFI 65-603, Emergency
and Extraordinary Expense Authority and gifts from such foreign officials and officers should
only be accepted in accordance with AFI 51-506, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force from
Domestic and Foreign Sources.
10.7. Property Management. The property lifecycle includes all the major stages in a property
item’s lifecycle: identification of the need to acquire the item; item purchase/acquisition; item use;
item repair; item disposal and replacement item.
10.7.1. Roles. The EFSS commander appoints the primary and alternate property account
custodians for APF, NAF, and Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services accounts.
10.7.1.1. EFSS Activity Manager. Manages individual activities within the EFSS and
usually serves as the appointed primary property account custodian for their respective
activities by the EFSS commander or director. The EFSS activity manager may designate
a subordinate to perform this duty in writing, but the activity manager maintains the
responsibility for the designated custodian’s performance.
10.7.1.2. Property Account Custodian. The activity manager and/or property custodian is
responsible for budgeting, ordering, receiving, controlling, and disposing of all equipment
and supplies within their respective activity.
10.7.1.3. The ELRS is the focal point for all property management matters to ensure
property control and disposal processes are consistent throughout the EFSS and to
maintain a single point accountability for excess and surplus property. The supply
customer service office provides logistics guidance, training, and assistance for EFSS
activities receiving APF, NAF, and Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services
support. Logistics support acts as the liaison between the EFSS and ELRS, contracting,
Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services, Nonappropriated Funds Council, and
RMs.
10.7.2. Training. The supply customer service office provides training to activity managers
and property account custodians for their day-to-day property management duties. This
includes account management, on-the-job training for newly assigned personnel, and guidance
and technical assistance on property management regulations, policies, and procedures.
10.7.3. Acquisition/Procurement. Supply customer service supports procurement by
researching product sources for the best quality and price and to ensure, prior to purchase,
requested items are not duplicative with other activities.
10.7.3.1. MWR activities can use APFs for Category A and B activities and approved
Category C activities at remote or isolated locations. Refer to AFI 65-106 and other NAFIs
for specific uses and limitations.
 
 
10-8
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
10.7.3.2. Supply customer service manages all MWR-related allowance standards and
ensures that all APF equipment items are authorized for MWR use in the appropriate
allowance standard.
10.7.3.3. For appropriated fund purchases up to $3,000, the activity manager (or
designated account custodian) can use the GPC if available at the contingency location.
Record the purchase on the GPC log. If the GPC is not available, purchases should be
made on an AF Form 9. Refer to AFI 64-117 for guidance on the use of this card for APF
purchases.
10.7.3.4. For APF purchases greater than $3,000, the activity manager or designated
account custodian uses AF Form 9 for those items.
10.7.3.5. All MWR activities can acquire DOD and Air Force excess and surplus property.
Supply customer service serves as the focal point for ordering, control, and basic
accountability of Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services property.
10.7.3.6. Request for Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services items through
ELRS (Category A and B items). Use procedures established for property acquired from
the chief of supply to account for these items. See AFI 23-101, Materiel Management
Policy for clarification of priorities and categories.
10.7.3.7. As the focal point for Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services property,
supply customer service should set up and maintain a single file folder relating to Defense
Logistics Agency Disposition Services-acquired property. Each file should contain, but not
be limited to, all issue, receipt, and turn-in documents relating to the excess and surplus
property assigned. A file is not required for expendable or consumable Defense Logistics
Agency Disposition Services property.
10.7.4. Receipt and Inspection. When property is received, the property custodian should
inspect the property and compare it to the receiving document to ensure it matches what has
been ordered (e.g., make, model number), the quantity delivered is the same as on receipt, and
the property is in good condition before accepting the delivery. If there is a problem with the
order, the custodian annotates the discrepancies on the receiving document. If the GPC was
used, the custodian immediately notifies the vendor of the problem. If an AF Form 9 was used
to purchase the property, the custodian contacts base contracting to ask them to contact the
vendor. The property custodian takes follow-up actions on all receiving documents indicating
a discrepancy until resolution.
10.7.4.1. After the property custodian has verified the property and quantity received are
accurate and noting any exception or variance, they sign and date the appropriate form and
if applicable, complete the receiving report in Internet-Based Purchasing System to signify
acceptance. Acceptable forms for NAF or APF items include: a sales slip, a delivery ticket,
an AF Form 2209, Nonappropriated Fund Order for Supplies or Services, DOD Form 250,
Material Inspection and Receiving Report, DOD Form 1155, Order for Supplies or
Services or a certificate of acceptance for receipt. For Defense Logistics Agency
Disposition Services items, use a DOD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document
or AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-in Request. For GPC purchases, the cardholder records or
completes the log to document the receipt.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-9
 
 
NOTE: In Internet-Based Purchasing System, the purchase order is equivalent to the AF Form
2209.
10.7.4.2. Partial Receipts. The property custodian identifies what is missing from the
original order on any certificate of acceptance made and on any file copies the custodian is
maintaining. If reason for partial shipment is not provided upon delivery, the custodian
should contact the vendor (GPC purchases) or ask base contracting (AF Form 9 purchases)
or NAF contracting (AF Form 2209 purchases) to contact the vendor for a status report.
The custodian should validate the order is eventually completed, rescinded, or amended
and file the final documents in the property file. For a partial shipment of property, the
property account custodian, supply customer service, and shared service center record only
the property actually received, regardless of quantities shown on the invoice or shipping
and transfer documents.
10.7.5. Accounting. Activities account for all NAF, Defense Logistics Agency Disposition
Services, and APF furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) classified as accountable and all
items designated as pilferable from the time it takes possession or a NAFI takes title until final
consumption or disposal of the property. There are two methods used to record EFSS property:
(1) master fixed asset listing (MFAL); (2) custodian authorization (CA)/custody receipt listing
(CRL).
10.7.5.1. The MFAL is the report used to record furniture, fixtures, equipment, and
pilferable items from all sources—NAF, Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services,
and APF. The exception is APF property with an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more.
10.7.5.2. Supply customer service or designated APF equipment custodian accounts for
APF capital or Budget Code 9 accountable property with an acquisition cost exceeding
$5,000 on the CA/CRL. Refer to AFI 23-101 for additional guidance.
10.7.5.3. APF reportable accountable furniture, fixtures, and equipment are property
purchased with APF (exception for acquisition cost of $5,000 or above) and deemed by
headquarters Air Force as reportable accountable. These items are accounted in the
CA/CRL.
10.7.5.4. APF Budget Code 9 furniture, fixtures, and equipment (including fitness center
equipment) are property purchased with APF and with an acquisition cost between $5,000
and $99,999 (excluding furniture in Federal Supply Group 71). These items are accounted
for in the CA/CRL, organizational visibility listing (OVL), or the MFAL.
10.7.5.5. APF pilferable furniture, fixtures, and equipment (including fitness center
equipment) are property with an acquisition cost of less than $5,000 and locally considered
to have a high risk of being pilfered. These items are accounted for in the CA/CRL, OVL,
or the MFAL.
10.7.5.6. Identification. To ensure MWR owned property can be tracked and accounted
for throughout its useful life, it should be labeled or marked with identification based upon
the type of funds used to purchase. Identification is affixed for the life of the property in a
way that does not detract or deface the property.
10.7.5.7. The equipment custodian coordinates with ELRS equipment accountability
element to obtain labels for all items maintained on their CA/CRL.
 
 
10-10
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
10.7.6. Property Control. The activity manager controls property by implementing physical
safeguards, ensuring all items are accurately accounted for on property listings, implementing
a preventive maintenance and repair program, understanding and fulfilling their duties as
property custodian as outlined in this TTP, conducting periodic spot checks of their inventory,
performing self-inspections of their property management program, and ensuring the
individual designated as custodian is properly trained to carry out their duties as custodian.
10.7.6.1. Physical safeguards for property include locks, secure buildings, proper lighting,
and alarm systems. If not sure how to best safeguard property, seek operational and staff
assistance from the RM, property custodian, or the security forces. Once in place, physical
controls should be periodically checked to be certain they continue to be effective and spot
checks should be performed on inventories with emphasis on pilferable items.
10.7.7. Preventative Maintenance and Repair Program. A preventive maintenance
program should be established for all items based on usage and manufacturers guidance. APFs
are used to sustain preventive maintenance and/or repair costs to NAF memorandum of
agreement (MOA) purchased assets and APF assets. Property useful life is extended by
keeping it in serviceable condition.
10.7.7.1. For items needing repair, the activity manager or custodian should determine if
the items (to include GPC purchases) are under warranty or contract maintenance. The
activity manager or custodian determines whether it is economically feasible and practical
to fix the item. Do not repair an item if the repair cost exceeds 75 percent of the acquisition
cost. APFs are used to sustain preventive maintenance and repairs to NAF MOA assets.
10.7.7.2. The property custodian is responsible for keeping a record of all repair costs.
Depending on the repair cost, purchasing a new item may be more cost effective. If the
items are being accounted for on the CA/CRL or the MFAL, the activity manager or
custodian should ensure the repairs are appropriately documented on the listing as
required.
10.7.7.3. For items with a contractual repair arrangement, retain the item and contact the
contractor for on-site repair or transport the item to the contractor’s facility. Ensure
accountable APF equipment items (e.g., items on the CA/CRL) that cannot be repaired
locally are processed through the ELRS equipment accountability element for repair and
return.
NOTE: Do not have APF equipment directly shipped or transferred to an off-base activity for
repair. Refer to AFI 23-101, Section 4C, Repair, or contact ELRS/materiel management activity
for guidance. For repair of warranty or guarantee items, contact the base contracting office.
10.7.8. Reconstitution Maintenance. When equipment has been redeployed to its home
base, reconstitution maintenance should be accomplished using APF funds for contingency
operations. Maintenance on equipment at a home station, including that designated for
imminent deployment, is funded with direct Air Force appropriations and not funds
appropriated for contingency operations.
10.7.9. Equipment and Supplies. UTC equipment and other organic unit items left in-place
at a deployed location at the direction of AFIs, commander orders, or designated approval
authority should be reconstituted using funds appropriated for contingency operations when
authorized and available. If funds appropriated for contingency operations are not available,
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-11
 
 
use existing Air Force total obligation authority with the appropriate ESP code to reconstitute
equipment and supplies left in-place at the deployed location. The deployed installation
commander, or designated authority, should identify in writing the unit equipment and
supplies being directed to remain in-place via memo with attached unit type code logistic
details, custodian authorization custody receipt listing, or standardized equipment and supplies
list. The memorandum serves as the authority for the owning unit to take appropriate supply
authorization, funding, and reconstitution actions upon return to home station.
10.7.10. Transfer and Disposal. Disposal of excess or unserviceable property permits more
efficient use of limited storage space for higher priority efforts. Prompt disposal also decreases
potential loss (e.g., from theft, neglect, or decay), removes fire hazards, and improves facility
housekeeping and sanitation.
10.7.10.1. Property should be disposed of when an organization no longer needs it either
due to excess or because the property has outlived its useful life and has become
unserviceable. Disposal actions may be necessary when management of an organization
has been outsourced to a contractor or a base is closing.
10.7.10.1.1. Serviceable furniture, fixtures, and equipment is defined as property
fulfilling its intended purpose or function.
10.7.10.1.2. Unserviceable furniture, fixtures, and equipment is unfit for continued
use, is no longer capable of fulfilling its intended purpose, or is not economical to
repair.
10.7.10.2. When disposing property, the activity manager or property account custodian
should first ensure that no other EFSS MWR activities can make use of the item before
they take any disposal actions. Once disposal determination is made, contact the logistics
support section for assistance in distribution to another activity or other disposal actions.
10.7.10.3. Property purchased with APF (includes MOA items APF to NAF purchases)
that are now unserviceable are turned-in to Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services
for disposal. Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures for additional
guidance. APF furniture, fixtures, and equipment should not be transferred outside the
EFSS organization without the assistance of ELRS equipment accountability element. For
accountable APF CA/CRL equipment items transferred between NAF activities, ensure
the activity is authorized the property in the basis of issue through the appropriate
allowance standard. If approved, ensure these transactions are processed through the
equipment accountability element of the ELRS.
10.7.10.4. Equipment custodians and activity managers should turn excess APF CA/CRL
equipment items in to the ELRS. This should occur as soon as possible after declaring the
equipment as being excess to the logistics support section. This includes all budget code 9
items that are loaded in the Materiel Management Information Technology system.
10.7.10.5. Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services and Qualified Recycling
Program property items may be disposed of when excess, no longer serviceable, or upon
base closure through return to Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services. All
Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services property is returned through the supply
customer service to the local Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services. The supply
customer service completes DOD Form 1348-1A.
 
 
10-12
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
NOTE: Property acquired through the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services is not
NAF property and may not be disposed of through the NAF sales outlet or a commercial vendor.
10.8. Cash Operations. See Table 10.2, Cash Operations.
Table 10.2. Cash Operations
Protection of 
Cash
1. The nonappropriated fund (NAF) funds custodian (FC) approves adequate safe-
guards for the protection of cash to make sure:
a. Only authorized personnel are permitted access to cash, including cash in 
locked containers or stored in safes.
b. Signed receipts are required for cash and property transferred to other 
individuals.
c. Personal funds are not stored or commingled with NAF cash, even if separate 
containers are used.
d. Cash is not stored in a safe designated for classified material (DODR 5200.1, 
DOD Information Security Program Regulation).
e. Funds storage containers and safes shall meet the requirements identified in 
DAFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (ID).
2. An OI for handling and safeguarding funds should be published for use by all 
cash handling functions, including procedures to follow during a robbery. Refer to 
AFMAN 34-202 for detailed procedures.
3. Funds storage limits are maintained in accordance with AFI 31-101.
a. The wing or site commander prescribes in writing the limits for storing funds 
during non-operating hours.
b. Per AFI 31-101, the funding limit for designated safes or vaults is under 
$100,000.
c. Funds held equal to or in excess of $100,000 require use of an alarmed vault.
Change Fund
1. The expeditionary force support squadron (EFSS) commander authorizes the 
establishment and amount of all change funds subject to fund storage limitations of 
AFMAN 31-101.
2. Authorized limits are entered in writing in the life of the fund (LOF) file (this 
also applies to appropriated fund (APF) funds and use of the life of the deployment 
[LOD] file).
3. Change funds are only authorized for making change.
4. Excessive change funds should be reduced by deposit to a banking account.
5. Cash accountability is maintained at all times between the s by using AF Form 
2557, NAF Cash Receipt Voucher.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-13
 
 
Surprise Cash 
Counts
1. The functional area manager (FAM), or a representative designated in writing 
who is independent of the cash function, makes surprise cash counts at least monthly, 
using AF Form 2556, NAF Surprise or General Cashier’s Cash Count.
2. Cash counts include all change funds, imprest funds, and receipts on hand.
3. Cash count of funds controlled by a central cashier must be accomplished 
monthly.
4. Variances will be reported accordingly to the FAM based on the size of the 
variance in funds and as established in an operating instruction (OI) for surprise 
cash counts.
5. AF Form 2556 should be forwarded to the fund’s custodian.
6. Internal control procedures and all transactions must be clearly documented. 
Documentation should be readily available and accessible for examination.
7. Recording of transactions and events (audit trail). The entire process or life cycle 
of transactions and other significant events are promptly recorded and properly 
classified to maintain pertinent, relevant, and valuable information for use by 
managers to control operations and make decisions.
8. Execution of transactions and events. Transactions and other significant events 
are authorized and executed only by persons acting within the scope of their 
authority.
9. Separation of duties. No individual should control all key aspects of a transaction 
or event. To ensure effective checks and balances exist, key duties and 
responsibilities for authorizing, processing, recording, and reviewing transactions 
must be separated among individuals.
10. Supervision. Supervisors must continuously review and approve the assigned 
work of their staff. Primary objectives are:
a. Provide assurance that internal control objectives are achieved.
b. Provide guidance and training to staff to minimize errors, waste, wrongful 
acts, and achieve management directives.
11. Access to and accountability for resources. Reduce risk by controlling the 
number of personnel with access and accountability.
a. Access to resources and records must be limited to authorized individuals.
b. Accountability for the custody and use of resources should be assigned and 
maintained to reduce the risk of unauthorized use or loss and to achieve 
management directives.
 
 
10-14
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Cash 
Registers 
(APF and 
NAF)
1. Cash registers are used in activities having regular cash receipts in a volume 
sufficient to justify their use.
2. Strongboxes may be used by activities having a small volume of cash receipts 
(under $200). 
3. AF Form 2555, NAF Collection Record, is used to record receipts when a cash 
register is not used.
4. Cash registers and strongboxes are kept under constant managerial observation 
and safeguarded at all times when they contain cash.
5. Do not use a cash register to store cash during non-operating hours.
6. When possible, place cash registers in a position so the visual display can be 
conveniently seen by the customer.
a. Follow these cash register procedures:
b. Cashiers ring each sale in view of the customer and, when the cash register is 
capable of providing a kick-out tape, gives each customer a receipt for the sale. 
Kick-out tapes do not need to be used for operations employing a system of 
guest checks or other customer receipt media.
c. Cashiers do not adjust an incorrectly rung sale on a subsequent sale. Account 
for the error using an AF Form 645, NAF Cash Register Adjustment, annotate 
the cash register tape to flag the error and attach it to the AF Form 1875, NAF 
Individual Cashier’s Report.
d. Ensure cash registers containing funds are under observation or secured to 
prevent access by unauthorized personnel.
e. For small operations with limited personnel, and where the resource manager 
(RM) (APF and NAF resource manager [RM]) deem controls are adequate to 
safeguard funds, more than one individual may operate from a single cash 
drawer. The appropriate APF or NAF RM designates, in writing, those activities 
authorized to have more than one individual operate from a single cash drawer. 
Keep written authorization in the appropriate LOF or LOD and activity file.
a. Control cash register reset and read keys.
• Do not reset registers. Resetting of period cumulative totals (i.e., daily,
weekly) is permitted if the register is so equipped and if the cumulative
journal register is not reset.
• Reset keys not needed to read or lock the register should be forwarded to
the appropriate fund custodian for safekeeping.
• The FAM controls the read keys.
b. At the end of each shift, the FAM reads the cash register. Cashiers complete 
item #5 on an AF Form 1875 and turn it in to the FAM with their change fund 
and receipts.
• The FAM records the cash register and determines cash overages or
shortages.
• The FAM secures the change fund and turns in the AF Form 1875 and
receipt to the custodian.
c. An AF Form 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center Report is used to 
consolidate the information from the individual cashier reports for each cost 
center within the NAF instrumentality (NAFI) or activity.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-15
 
 
NAF Banking
1. EFSS commander assures that operating FAMs avoid accumulating cash in 
excess of operating needs.
2. Deposits should be made no less than weekly.
3. All receipts should be deposited on the last day of each month (or as close as 
possible).
4. A suitable safe and other necessary security measures for the storage of cash 
should be provided when daily deposits are not made.
Replacing 
Resource and 
Property 
Managers
1. The EFSS commander should appoint a successor in writing. The letter of 
appointment should be filed in the LOF file.
2. Prepare a schedule of obligations (liabilities) for the unit morale, welfare, and 
recreation (MWR) fund.
3. Transfer the established perpetual LOF file to the new RM.
4. Prepare a statement of financial condition and bank reconciliation.
5. Transfer all NAF and APF assets following a physical inventory of all saleable 
merchandise, property, and equipment. If saleable inventory is accountable by a 
FAM, then there is no transfer requirement.
Special 
Morale and 
Welfare 
(SM&W)
1. Special purpose morale and welfare (SM&W) reports are prepared following the 
end of each quarter (31 December, 31 March, 30 June, 30 September).
2. Reports are forwarded to the theater’s supporting major command (MAJCOM) 
services office by the 20th of the following month.
3. Each cost center code (CCC) is listed separately with totals for each. A CCC with 
no activity is completed with a $0 designation. Negative reports should be processed 
and signed.
4. The Wing or site commander signs this report.
NAF Support 
of the 
Chaplain
1. NAF funds (not SM&W funds) may be used to support chapel activities when the 
activity is a joint chapel and services effort. Authorization is approved in writing by 
the theater’s supporting MAJCOM services office prior to expenditure. Typical 
guidance is:
a. Activities are non-denominational and open to everyone.
b. NAFs can only be used to purchase consumables (e.g., pizza, ice cream).
c. Chapel allotted APFs are used to purchase supplies (e.g., napkins, plates, 
decorations).
2. NAFs for this use should be included in the annual budget.
3. Supplemental funds must be justified in writing to the theater’s supporting 
MAJCOM services office.
4. The theater-supporting MAJCOM should establish yearly limits for each 
location based on budget requests and circumstances.
5. The theater-supporting MAJCOM must approve, in writing, any supplemental 
NAFs and records must be kept in the LOF file.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
10.9. Nonappropriated Fund Resource Management. This section describes requirements for
spending NAFs and controlling NAF assets. See Table 10.3, NAF Guidance.
Table 10.3. NAF Guidance
10.9.1. NAF Assets. The Component Theater Services Planner should be consulted before
expending or acquiring NAF assets as there are specific requirements that must be met.
Theaters may have specific provisions or prohibitions regarding the use of NAFs. A servicing
NAF accounting office (AO) should be established prior to the use of NAFs. The Services
Planner in conjunction with the servicing NAF AO will provide detailed guidance on the
purchase, control, inventory, and management of NAF assets.
10.9.2. Defined. NAFs are government funds, which are primarily generated by Prime RIBS
activities from goods or services provided. NAFs are a separate funding type, different from
APFs which are funds appropriated from Congress and recorded by the United States
Treasury. They are not appropriated by Congress. AFMAN 34-201 takes precedence if there is
a conflict in guidance regarding NAFs.
10.9.3. Purpose of NAFs. NAFs are used for the collective benefit of military personnel,
their families, and authorized civilians. These funds support MWR programs, lodging, and
other programs and NAFI as defined by guiding instructions.
10.9.3.1. NAFs enhance MWR programming. If an item is authorized APF support, then
NAFs cannot be used. The lack of APF availability does not make NAF use permissible.
Any item that is used solely and exclusively to generate revenue must be purchased with
NAFs.
10.9.3.2. The function(s) supported with NAFs must be available to everyone and support
the EFSS MWR program. NAFs may not be used to support non-EFSS activities unless
specifically authorized by regulation or instruction (e.g., Chaplain Support).
10.9.4. Roles and Responsibilities. Below is a list of key roles and responsibilities with
regards to property management. It is not all inclusive. Refer to AFMAN 34-204 for detailed
roles and responsibilities.
10.9.4.1. Expeditionary Force Support Commander. The EFSS commander or applicable
squadron commander over the EFSS functions (e.g., support squadron commander)
appoints the primary and alternate property account custodians for APF, NAF, and Defense
Logistics Agency Disposition Services accounts.
10.9.4.2. Flight Chief. Flight chiefs ensure their activity managers fulfill their property
responsibilities.
10.9.4.3. Resource Management Flight Chief or Resource Manager. The resource
management flight chief (RMFC) or resource manager (RM) ensures the policies and

AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-17
 
 
procedures regarding property management are followed and performed. They provide
oversight (direction and assistance) for all assets utilized in the EFSS.
10.9.4.4. The NAF RM is appointed as the NAF funds custodian (NAF FC) for NAF
report accountability, management, and oversight. To maintain overall asset accountability
and to create an audit trail, the NAF RM maintains account records in safeguarded files
throughout the life of a NAF fund. For NAFs, the NAF FC maintains the controlled life of
the fund (LOF) file. The NAF FC acts as the recorder for the NAF Council if established.
Below are actions required of the NAF RM:
10.9.4.4.1. Records all newly purchased accountable property in a general ledger.
10.9.4.4.2. Assigns a locally established asset designator to identify the new property,
enters it into the appropriate accounting system, and provides the information on a
label to the appropriate NAF property manager (PM) for the associated flight property
account custodian (PAC).
10.9.4.4.3. Ensures that each incoming activity manager accepts accountability and
completes a memorandum receipt/assumption of duties upon standup of the activity.
10.9.4.4.4. Ensures (as necessary) that proper documentation is processed when
property is loaned or transferred to other activities, disposed of, or removed from the
MFAL.
10.9.4.4.5. Ensures that adequate descriptions and appropriate depreciation (or
amortization) schedules are assigned to all accountable NAF property on the MFAL.
10.9.4.4.6. Consolidates budget requirements from all NAF activities for review and
incorporates NAF-associated actions for NAF Council and site commander approval.
10.9.4.4.7. Initiates follow-up on annual (or other) property account inventories to
ensure reviews, reports of inquiry, reports of survey, or investigations are conducted
for missing property.
10.9.4.4.8. Submits annual statement of assurance to the EFSS commander.
10.9.4.4.9. Conducts quarterly certification of NAF financial statements.
10.9.5. Activity Manager. Manages individual activities within the EFSS and usually serves
as the appointed primary PAC for their respective activities by the EFSS commander. The
activity manager may designate in writing a subordinate to perform this duty. The activity
manager maintains the responsibility for the designated custodian’s performance.
10.9.6. Property Account Custodian. The activity manager and property custodian are
responsible for budgeting, ordering, receiving, controlling, and disposing of all equipment and
supplies within their respective activity.
10.10. NAF Property Management. Property is defined as furniture, fixtures, equipment, and
vehicles. As used here, property does not include buildings, structures, or real estate. Property
management covers all actions and responsibilities pertaining to the property’s lifecycle.
10.10.1. Property Lifecycle. This cycle includes all the major stages in a property item’s
lifecycle. All five stages are identified below, but only the first two will be addressed in this
TTP. Refer to AFMAN 34-204 for detailed guidance.
 
 
10-18
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
• Identification of the need to acquire the item.
• Item purchase/acquisition.
• Item use.
• Item repair.
• Item disposal and/or replacement item.
10.10.1.1. Plan, Budget, and Acquire (1st Lifecycle Stage). Property management starts at
this lifecycle stage. It includes all preparatory steps for acquiring the property item up to
the point of physical receipt.
10.10.1.2. Planning and Prioritization. Planning is identifying the need for a property
item. Planning is an annual process updated quarterly as part of the EFSS budget process.
When building a property purchase plan or updating requirements listing, ensure a priority
is established for each item. Priority may be based on the expense, time sensitivity, and
justification of each item.
10.10.1.3. Budgeting. Budgeting takes the priorities during the planning stage and
determines how to fund each item. Prime RIBS uses two basic types of funding, APFs and
NAFs in its budget process. Property items should not be budgeted using both appropriated
and nonappropriated funds. The correct fund source should be used for budgeting (e.g.,
NAF for NAF property).
10.10.1.4. If an item is authorized APF support, then NAFs cannot be used. The lack of
APF availability does not make NAF use permissible. Refer to AFMAN 34-201 for
additional information.
10.10.1.5. Activity managers prepare the annual NAF requirements budget prior to the
beginning of the fiscal year.
10.10.1.6. NAF budgets are revised each quarter based on current performance and
expected changes. Refer to AFMAN 34-209 for NAF budget procedures.
10.10.1.7. All levels of the EFSS take part in the budget review and approval process once
the activity manager completes the activity’s budget. The installation commander
approves the completed budgets for all NAF instrumentalities.
10.10.1.8. Budgets should be developed by day 60 after the start of a beddown if the
location is not considered to be a temporary contingency location (i.e., lasting only for one
AFFORGEN deployment cycle).
10.10.1.9. Administrative responsibility for budget submissions and for ensuring
spending remains within approved funding levels belongs to the NAF RM. The NAF RM
(acting as fund custodians appointed by the EFSS commander) consolidates the inputs
from the activity managers by requirements and prepares a budget for the EFSS
commander.
10.10.1.10. The EFSS commander reviews the consolidated budgets and ensures that each
is comprehensive, realistic, and provides a well-rounded and balanced services program
without conflicts between use and choice of APFs and NAFs. The EFSS commander
decides which requirements to fund and how funds should be spent given the available
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-19
 
 
resources. The plans are then submitted to the Wing or site commander for budget
approval.
10.10.1.11. Prime RIBS personnel should be aware that the theater may change some of
the reporting requirements. This is done to meet theater needs and identify new procedures
in parallel with publications used by the CCO or FM.
10.10.1.12. Refer to AFI 65-610, for guidance on administrative, general support, and
QoL expenditures at deployed locations.
10.10.2. Acquisition. Acquisition begins once funding is approved. The activity manager
should send all purchase requests for NAF requirements budget items to the RM. The RM
reviews each request before buying to ensure it is an approved NAF requirements budget
purchase and funds are available to make the purchase.
10.10.2.1. For NAF purchases up to $5,000, the activity manager or designated account
custodian makes the purchase in accordance with local procedures. Ensure the purchase is
included on the NAF purchase log.
10.10.2.2. For NAF purchases greater than $5,000, the Activity manager or designated
account custodian prepares Air Force Form 9 and submits it to the contracting office for
procurement in accordance with local procedures.
10.10.3. Receive and Account (2nd Lifecycle Stage). The receive and account lifecycle
stage validates the use of funds (i.e., what was paid for was received) and establishes the
baseline for tracking and safeguarding the item until it is permanently removed from an
activity’s inventory.
10.10.3.1. The receive and account three phase process is as follows:
• Initial receipt and inspection of the property.
• Accounting for property.
• Marking or labeling property received.
10.10.3.2. The purpose of each is to ensure activities are getting exactly what has been
ordered and paid for.
10.10.3.3. Receipt/Inspection. When property is received, the property custodian should
inspect the property and compare it to the receiving document to ensure it matches what
has been ordered (e.g., make, model number), the quantity delivered is the same as on
receipt, and the property is in good condition before accepting the delivery. If there is a
problem with the order, the custodian annotates the discrepancies on the receiving
document. If an AF Form 9 was used to purchase the property, the custodian requests base
contracting contact the vendor. The property custodian takes follow-up actions on all
receiving documents indicating a discrepancy until resolution.
10.10.3.4. Acceptance. After the property custodian has verified the property and quantity
received are accurate, and after noting any exception or variance, they sign and date the
appropriate form. A list of acceptable forms can be found in AFMAN 34-209.
10.11. Protecting NAF Assets. NAF funds should be controlled with security provided
throughout the deployment. Funds storage limits should be established for the location and each
 
 
10-20
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
fund handling site. Funds storage require approval of the contingency site commander. APF and
NAF cash should not be contained within the same secure storage container. Based on a review
with security forces, store NAF funds (according to local security forces guidelines) in a General
Services Administration (GSA)-approved storage container or safe. Security forces requirements
are established in AFI 31-101, which provides detailed requirements for protecting funds.
10.11.1. Deposits. Avoid storage of large amounts of cash by depositing NAF cash in bank
accounts. Keep enough funds on hand to operate for 30 days or based on local requirements.
10.11.1.1. Keep stored NAF funds under the $100,000 threshold amount to avoid
requiring an intrusion detection system (IDS) or being designated as a controlled area as
identified in AFI 31-101.
10.11.1.2. Deposit excess cash in bank accounts in accordance with established
Component Theater Services Planner guidance. Obtain account information through the
servicing AO or FM agency. Deposit procedures may be theater-specific, but excess NAFs
are usually deposited into the designated bank accounts by working with FM’s pay agent
to issue a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, or to cut a US Treasury check for the
funds. At some locations you may even have to purchase a money order to send by
certified mail. The fund transfer instrument (e.g., DD Form 1131, Treasury check, or
money order) is sent through the theaters’ designated support office(s) for subsequent
deposit.
10.11.1.3. Fund storage information is documented in the location’s NAF LOF file.
10.11.2. Foreign Funds. Some locations require foreign currency to be used for contracts and
purchase of supplies and equipment. It is important to determine with FM if foreign currency
will be used at the location, especially if deploying to support an initial beddown. If so, work
with the FM and the CCO to identify procedures and train personnel in the use and
identification of foreign currency, as well as converting it back to US funds through the FM
offices. Foreign currencies are treated as cash. Control procedures are the same as with other
NAF and APF monies. There may need to be a need to modify cash count forms, such as AF
Form 2556 to account for the specific foreign currency denominations. If not already added in
a WRM kit for APF and NAF support, order cash registers to support operations. Dual
currency locations may require cash registers that are programmed and slotted for dual
currency use including dual journal tracking of sales.
10.11.3. Internal Controls. Internal controls should be understood by all Prime RIBS
members. Safeguarding physical assets and properly managing scarce resources is paramount
to long-term success of NAF operations. All personnel should understand their responsibilities
to ensure effective internal controls are followed. Refer to AFMAN 34-202 for detailed
guidance.
10.11.3.1. All members (military and civilian) of the force support team who are directly
involved with the handling of NAF funds or control of NAF assets, have oversight of these
personnel, and any other personnel the EFSS commander designates will complete NAF
Internal Controls training within 30 days of hire or assignment and receive annual
refresher training. The NAFI may conduct any additional hands-on training that may be
recommended or needed as it applies to the unique needs of each location.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-21
 
 
10.11.3.2. NAF assets are accounted for within Services by the appointed NAF FC and the
property manager that handles NAF items. To prevent the appearance of conflict and
maintain a greater level of accountability, the person who orders an asset (either the PM or
an authorized activity manager) is not allowed to also receive the asset directly. Upon
receipt, the NAF FC records the assets in a general ledger prior to release to the PM or
responsible Services FAM/PAC. The NAF FC produces a MFAL that is used to record
NAF furniture, fixtures, and equipment and pilferable items. The PM and FAMs use the
MFAL for at least monthly inventory checks. As a part of overall RM responsibilities, the
NAF RM develops an accountability system and identifies NAF-accountable items with
property labels.
10.11.3.3. The EFSS commander issues an annual statement of assurance that internal
controls exist, are adequate, and are being followed. The EFSS commander should ensure
that the statement of assurance has considered (1) all factors in Services NAF programs,
including inspections and spot checks, (2) any investigations or financial reviews, and (3)
management knowledge gained from daily operations. Individual activities may develop
additional operational guidelines and checklists to cover operations. These checklists
should be in addition to the primary OIs and internal control checklists (ICC) and should
not conflict.
10.12. Operating Instructions and Checklist. OIs should be developed and enforced for the
various MWR programs. A copy of each OI should be provided to Theater Services Planners for
review. See Table 10.4, NAF Subjects and Management Actions for important NAF subjects and
management actions to consider.

Table 10.4. NAF Subjects and Management Actions
Nonappropriated Fund 
(NAF) Subject
Management Actions
Imprest and Petty Cash 
Funds
1. Imprest funds are obtained to start up a resale operation.
a. As the new activity grows and operates, it reimburses the amount of money 
originally provided by the supporting command to initiate operations.
b. Reimbursements are supported by AF Form 1401, NAF Petty Cash/Refund 
Voucher.
c. Imprest funds are reimbursed when necessary, but are always reimbursed on the 
last workday of the month (or as close as possible).
2. Except for Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) imprest funds or for a 
location with a higher theater limitation, the expeditionary force support squadron 
(EFSS) commander approves the establishment and sets the amount of imprest funds not 
to exceed $3,000 in volume of transactions.
3. Petty cash portions of an imprest fund are used to purchase items for a new activity. 
Consider the average number of transactions and dollar amount of monthly 
disbursements (based on historical review) when establishing the level of the petty cash 
fund.
4. The authorized limits are maintained in the LOF file.
5. Payments for any single purchase from the petty cash fund may not exceed $500.
a. Expenditures from petty cash funds cannot be split to circumvent the $500 
limitation.
b. The nonappropriated fund (NAF) funds custodian (FC) uses AF Form 2557 to 
advance cash to an individual for a designated purchase.
c. After the purchase, the individual who received the funds fills out an AF Form 
1401 and returns all unused cash and the receipts.
6. Cash advances made from petty cash, invoices and receipts, and cash not used must 
be returned within two working days of purchase.
Purchases over $500
1. Purchases over $500 are processed on an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase.
a. The EFSS commander approves all purchases over $500.
b. The manager desiring to make a purchase initiates the AF Form 9 and signs as 
the requesting official.
c. When designated and approved by the contingency contracting officer (CCO), 
the EFSS commander signs as the approving official and the NAF FC is the 
certifying official.
2. The original form is given to the vendor and copies are retained by the custodian and 
activity manager.
a. When the goods are delivered, a manager (see separation of duties) 
acknowledges receipt on DD Form 250.
b. The manager forwards the DD Form 250, a copy of the Form 9, and the invoice 
to the NAF FC for payment to the vendor.
NOTE: The CCO will determine similar APF spending limits. The single purchase
threshold may be lower or higher than $500. Verify spending limits with the CCO.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-23
 
 
Separation of Duties
1. The custodian should ensure there is a separation of responsibility for purchasing and 
receiving an item.
2. Individuals authorized to make purchases (against established blanket purchase 
agreements (BPA) or by other contracting means) must not inspect and accept goods 
received.
3. An operating instruction (OI) should ensure internal controls are in effect that 
address this requirement.
Protection of Cash
1. The NAF FC approves adequate safeguards for the protection of cash to make sure:
a. Only authorized personnel are permitted access to cash, including cash in locked 
containers, or stored in safes.
b. Signed receipts are required for cash and property transferred to other 
individuals.
c. Personal funds are not stored or commingled with NAF cash, even if separate 
containers are used.
d. Cash is not stored in a safe designated for classified material (DODR 5200.1).
e. Funds storage containers and safes shall meet the requirements identified in AFI 
31-101.
2. An OI for handling and safeguarding funds must be published for use by all cash 
handling functions, including procedures to follow during a robbery. AFMAN 34-202 
contains detailed procedures.
3. Funds storage limits will be maintained IAW AFI 31-101.
a. The Wing or site commander prescribes in writing the limits for storing funds 
during non-operating hours.
b. Per AFI 31-101, the funding limit for designated safes or vaults is under 
$100,000.
c. Funds held equal to or in excess of $100,000 require use of an alarmed vault.
Change Fund
1. The EFSS commander authorizes the establishment and amount of all change funds 
subject to fund storage limitations of AFMAN 31-101.
2. Authorized limits are entered in writing in the LOF file (this also applies to APF 
funds and use of the LOD file).
3. Change funds are only authorized for making change.
4. Excessive change funds must be reduced by deposit to a banking account.
5. Cash accountability is maintained at all times between the NAF FC and the 
functional area manager (FAM) by using AF Form 2557.
Surprise Cash Counts
1. The FAM, or a representative designated in writing who is independent of the cash 
function, makes surprise cash counts at least monthly, using AF Form 2556.
2. Cash counts include all change funds, imprest funds, and receipts on hand.
3. Cash count of funds controlled by a central cashier must be accomplished monthly.
4. Variances will be reported accordingly to the FAM based on the size of the variance 
in funds and as established in an OI for surprise cash counts.
5. AF Form 2556 will be forwarded to the funds custodian.
 
 
10-24
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Specific Standards for 
Internal Control
1. Internal control procedures and all transactions must be clearly documented. 
Documentation should be readily available and accessible for examination.
2. Recording of transactions and events (audit trail). The entire process or life cycle of 
transactions and other significant events are promptly recorded and properly classified 
to maintain pertinent, relevant, and valuable information for use by managers to control 
operations and make decisions.
3. Execution of transactions and events. Transactions and other significant events are 
authorized and executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority.
4. Separation of duties. No individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or 
event. To ensure effective checks and balances exist, key duties and responsibilities for 
authorizing, processing, recording, and reviewing transactions must be separated among 
individuals.
5. Supervision. Supervisors must continuously review and approve the assigned work 
of their staff. Primary objectives are:
a. Provide assurance that internal control objectives are achieved.
b. Provide guidance and training to staff to minimize errors, waste, wrongful acts, 
and achieve management directives.
6. Access to and accountability for resources. Reduce risk by controlling the number of 
personnel with access and accountability.
a. Access to resources and records must be limited to authorized individuals.
b. Accountability for the custody and use of resources should be assigned and 
maintained to reduce the risk of unauthorized use or loss and to achieve 
management directives.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022

Cash Registers (APF and 
NAF)
1. Cash registers must be used in activities having regular cash receipts in a volume 
sufficient to justify their use.
2. Strongboxes may be used by activities having a small volume of cash receipts (under 
$200). 
3. AF Form 2555, NAF Collection Record, must be used to record receipts when a cash 
register is not used.
4. Cash registers and strongboxes are kept under constant managerial observation and 
safeguarded at all times when they contain cash.
5. Do not use a cash register to store cash during non-operating hours.
6. When possible, place cash registers in a position so the visual display can be 
conveniently seen by the customer.
7. Follow these cash register procedures:
a. Cashiers ring each sale in view of the customer and, when the cash register is 
capable of providing a kick-out tape, gives each customer a receipt for the sale. 
Kick-out tapes are not needed for operations employing a system of guest checks or 
other customer receipt media.
b. Cashiers do not adjust an incorrectly rung sale on a subsequent sale. Account for 
the error using an AF Form 645, annotate the cash register tape to flag the error and 
attach it to the AF Form 1875.
c. Ensure cash registers containing funds are under observation or secured to 
prevent access by unauthorized personnel.
d. For small operations with limited personnel, and where the RM (APF and NAF 
RM) deem controls are adequate to safeguard funds, more than one individual may 
operate from a single cash drawer. The appropriate APF or NAF RM designates, in 
writing, those activities authorized to have more than one individual operate from a 
single cash drawer. Keep written authorization in the appropriate LOF or LOD and 
activity file.
e. Control cash register reset and read keys.
1. Do not reset registers. Resetting of period cumulative totals (i.e., daily, 
weekly, etc.) is permitted if the register is so equipped and if the cumulative 
journal register is not reset.
2. Reset keys not needed to read or lock the register should be forwarded to the 
appropriate fund custodian for safekeeping.
3. The FAM controls the read keys.
f. At the end of each shift, the FAM reads the cash register. Cashiers complete item 
#5 on an AF Form 1875 and turn it in to the FAM with their change fund and 
receipts.
1. The FAM records the cash register and determines cash overages/shortages.
2. The FAM secures the change fund and turns in the AF Form 1875 and 
receipt to the custodian.
g. An AF Form 1876 is used to consolidate the information from the individual 
cashier reports for each cost center within the NAF instrumentality (NAFI) or 
activity.

10.13. APF and NAF Contracts. This section provides proven TTP for establishing and
providing oversight of both APF and NAF contracts.
10.13.1. Contingency Contracting. Contingency contracting is defined as the process of
obtaining goods, services, and construction via contracting means in support of contingency
operations.
NAF Banking
1. EFSS/commander assures that operating FAMs avoid accumulating cash in excess of 
operating needs.
2. Deposits must be made no less than weekly.
3. All receipts must be deposited on the last day of each month (or as close as possible).
4. A suitable safe and other necessary security measures for the storage of cash must be 
provided when daily deposits are not made.
Replacing Resource and 
Property Managers
1. The EFSS commander should appoint a successor in writing. The letter of 
appointment is filed in the LOF file.
2. Prepare a schedule of obligations (liabilities) for the unit morale, welfare, and 
recreation (MWR) fund.
3. Transfer the established perpetual LOF file to the new RM.
4. Prepare a statement of financial condition and bank reconciliation.
5. Transfer all NAF and APF assets following a physical inventory of all saleable 
merchandise, property, and equipment. If saleable inventory is accountable by a FAM, 
then there is no transfer requirement.
Special Morale and 
Welfare (SM&W)
6. Special purpose morale and welfare (SM&W) reports will be prepared following the 
end of each quarter (31 December, 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September).
7. Reports must be forwarded to the theater’s supporting major command (MAJCOM) 
services office by the 20th of the following month.
8. Each cost center code (CCC) is listed separately with totals for each. A CCC with no 
activity is completed with a $0 designation. Negative reports should be processed and 
signed.
9. The wing or site commander signs this report.
NAF Support of the 
Chaplain
1. NAF funds (not SM&W funds) may be used to support chapel activities when the 
activity is a joint chapel and Services effort. Authorization should be routed to the 
Theater Services Planner prior to expenditure. Typical guidance is:
a. Activities should be non-denominational and open to everyone.
b. NAFs can only be used to purchase consumables (e.g., pizza, ice cream).
c. Chapel allotted APFs are used to purchase supplies (e.g., napkins, plates, 
decorations)
2. NAFs for this use should be included in the annual budget.
a. Supplemental funds must be justified in writing to the Theater Services Planner 
office.
b. The Theater Services Planner should establish yearly limits for each location 
based on budget requests and circumstances.
c. The Theater Services Planner should coordinate approval in writing any 
supplemental NAFs. Any records should be kept in the LOF file.

10.13.2. Contract Support. Theater planners and EFSS often have either contract templates
or existing contracts they can provide to Prime RIBS for contingency support. These contracts
can be used as a starting point to help develop site-specific contracts as needed.
10.13.3. Roles and Responsibilities. Effective contract support requires strong partnerships
between the ECONS and the EFSS. Refer to AFI 64-105 for more information. See Table
10.5, Contracting Roles and Responsibilities.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-29
 
 
10.13.4. Reasons to Contract. Contingency contracting is a force multiplier. There is a
limited number of Prime RIBS forces and resources available to support contingency
operations. Initial operations rely almost exclusively on organic forces (military and DOD
civilians) as the primary manpower to establish and operate services programs. Initial
equipment and assets are contained in the WRM program which consists of mostly tent-based
structures and limited equipment assets.
10.13.5. Contract Objective. The goal of effective contracting is to both reduce the number
of Prime RIBS deployers required to support contingency operations and to increase
operational capability through additional manpower and resources. For example, due to
limited Prime RIBS forces on the ground, only limited fitness programming can be offered.
Under contracted fitness operations, a site can fully staff the facility, offer fitness classes, offer
robust sports programs and intramurals, obtain equipment maintenance, offer a resale
operation within the facility, and reduce the number of Prime RIBS deployers which reduces
the constant deployment tempo for Prime RIBS.
10.13.6. Types of Contracts. There are various type of contracts to obtain goods, services,
and construction. Below are the most common types used at contingency locations.
10.13.6.1. Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). A BPA is a simplified method of filling
anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing charge accounts with
qualified sources of supply. For example, if the recreation center resale operation wanted
Contracting Officer 
Representative (COR)
1. Prior to contract award, complete necessary training 
based on the type of contracts to be administered.
2. Review contracts/modifications and become familiar 
with both Government and contractor responsibilities and 
work that is covered (and not covered) by the contract.
3. Oversee contractor performance and conduct 
surveillance in accordance with the QASP to ensure 
contract terms and conditions are met (e.g., contractor 
badging, schedules, quantities, and receiving reports).
4. Notify the CCO of any actual or potential personal 
conflicts of interest.
5. Participate, as requested, in requirements 
definition/pre-award activities.
6. Accomplish monthly performance assessment reports 
that summarize results of performance surveillance and 
submit to the requiring activity unit commander and the 
CCO.
7. Maintain a COR file for each contract that they monitor.
8. Notify the CCO immediately of any changes in 
circumstances, such as PCS, that will require the COR 
appointment to be terminated and successor COR to be 
appointed.
 
 
10-30
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
to buy resale items from a supplier on a reoccurring basis, they would work with the CCO
to establish a BPA. The same process would be used to purchase ice for the DFACs. The
BPA typically identifies the item(s) that can be obtained and the price for each item.
Finance must certify funds are available before the BPA can be awarded.
10.13.6.1.1. BPAs can be funded via APFs or NAFs. There are two types of BPAs
most often used to support Prime RIBS requirements: centralized and decentralized.
10.13.6.1.2. Centralized BPAs provide limited capabilities for Prime RIBS to procure
needed items, equipment, and support because it limits local purchase options. Only
CCO can place calls (order items under the agreement). This can be extremely limiting
during initial beddowns and could stop many support efforts since CCOs often have
multiple competing contracting requirements and reduced manpower. Centralized
BPAs may become an acceptable practice during the sustainment phase when the CCO
has a more fully staffed office and identified contract sources.
10.13.6.1.3. Decentralized BPAs provide more flexibility during beddowns when
actions are more chaotic. They can place a greater paperwork, accountability, and legal
burden on the Services organization if not managed smartly. Decentralized BPAs must
be authorized, have funds against them, have a maximum fund limit for purchase of
items and services, and be used only for permissible purchases within the fund
categories.
10.13.6.1.4. A decentralized BPA can avoid placing demands on the CCO office each
time there is a need for small value goods and services. It can also speed up overall
purchasing if the supply pipeline is backed up with stateside deliveries and there are
many small items available locally at a reasonable price. Actions are reconciled with
the CCO, supply, and FM to create or maintain an audit trail. Purchases are
documented to capture assets within the various supply and NAF asset control and
accounting systems.
10.13.6.2. Local Contracts. These are contracts with local or host country sources to
provide non-personal services. Common examples of local contracts include mess
attendant, equipment maintenance, and laundry and dry cleaning. Since these contracts
employ local nationals (LN) or other country national (OCN) contractors, Prime RIBS will
most likely be required to provide escort services based on local force protection
requirements. LN/OCNs most likely will not be able to access government computer
systems due to force protection condition (FPCON) requirements.
10.13.6.3. Civil Augmentation Program (CAP) Contracts. AFCAP is the most common
CAP contract used where the Air Force is responsible for BOS. These can be cost plus or
firm fixed price with firm fixed price being the preferred type. AFCAP contracts typically
employ a mix of US Nationals as well as LN/OCNs.
10.13.6.3.1. Since AFCAP employs US Nationals, they are able to gain access to
government computer systems (if contractually required and they have the appropriate
security clearance). The contract can require the contractor to escort their LN/OCN
contractor workforce, further reducing Prime RIBS manpower requirements.
10.13.6.4. NAF Contracts. Since there are no NAF contracting officers at contingency
locations, the CCO provides all NAF contracting support. AFMAN 64-302 provides
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-31
 
 
additional guidance for NAF contracts. A NAFI Instrumentality is required with a
servicing NAF AO before establishing NAF contracts.
10.13.6.5. Concessionaire Contracts. These are contracts to provide goods or services
such as restaurants, massage, and souvenir sales. AAFES has supremacy which means first
right of refusal. If Prime RIBS wants to enter into a NAF contract with a potential
concessionaire, AAFES is given the opportunity to do so first. If AAFES elects to do so,
then services is not permitted. If AAFES declines the offer, receive the denial in writing,
file it in the LOF and LOD files for future use, and then work with the CCO to develop a
contract.
10.13.6.5.1. When determining how to receive income from the concessionaire, it is
recommended it be based on the concessionaire’s gross income and not based on their
profit. If receiving a percentage of their profits, it is harder to determine the actual
income received due the concessionaire expenses (food, labor, facility, supplies) are
paid out before determining their profit and paying the NAFI. The percentage the
NAFI will receive is specified within the contract.
10.13.6.5.2. Bazaars are executed as concessionaire contracts.
10.13.6.6. Entertainment Contracts. Before pursuing locally procured entertainment, the
AFE office should be contacted to determine if they can support. NAFs are permitted to
procure entertainment if local leadership determines that the AFE-provided entertainment
is insufficient. Any requirement for entertainment must be identified in the NAF spend
plan and approved by the installation commander.
10.13.6.6.1. If AFE cannot support, the CCO will issue contracts for all locally NAF
funded entertainment. Contact the CCO before beginning any discussions with a
promoter or entertainer to avoid unintentionally obligating the government. Only the
CCO has warranted individuals authorized to obligate the government. All
requirements must be stated in the contract.
10.13.6.6.2. Insurance. NAF Standard Clauses can be found at
https://www.afnafpo.afsv.net. Section 8 of the NAF Standard Clauses requires the
contractor to carry insurance. The types of insurance are implied in the contract terms
and conditions. A recommendation is for a minimum of $1,000,000 in medical
evacuation and $50,000 in health coverage. Property, liability, and health are the
responsibility of the contractor to purchase. The terms and conditions are there to
protect the Government if something were to happen. The contractor can choose the
level of coverage. The applicable local/state laws where the company is located is what
drives the level of insurance purchased.
10.13.6.6.3. Electronic Payments. If payment is to be made via electronic funds
transfer (EFT), the EFT enrollment form should be submitted to the servicing NAF AO
along with the completed contract. If any advance payments are required, this
requirement needs to be included in the contract. Contract and EFT enrollment should
be submitted to the servicing NAF AO no later than 30 to 45 days prior to the
performance date. If the entertainers have not previously worked for AF NAF, then an
EFT enrollment and contract will be needed 45 days prior to performance. This is
 
 
10-32
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
needed to have information established in the Air Force banking system and Internet
Based Purchasing System (IBPS).
10.13.7. Contract Considerations. Prime RIBS members know the importance of contracts,
but they often lack the technical experience to develop them. Before developing contract
language, Prime RIBS members should answer some basic questions:
• How long will the location be operational?
• Is funding available?
• What specific requirement(s) is being satisfied?
• How quickly does the contract need to be operational?
• What are the contracting options?
10.13.7.1. Duration. Duration of operations will be the main driver regarding whether
contracts are practical. Contracts for missions that are projected to last less than 12-months
may not be practical from a contracted manpower perspective, but BPAs to acquire goods
may be essential. This will be location and mission specific. See Table 10.6, Contingency
Location Types.
Table 10.6. Contingency Location Types
10.13.7.2. Funding. Coordinate with the resource advisor or FM to determine if funds are
available to support the contracting effort. Contracting efforts may need to be prioritized if
funding is limited.
10.13.7.3. Requirement. Prime RIBS members must know what requirement(s) they are
trying to satisfy. Is the goal to retain military leadership and management of an activity but
have a contractor perform all of the functions? Should the contractor provide all facets of
food service to include the facility? Who will order rations? Is equipment maintenance
needed? Will the military perform food service accounting? Is there a need for a contract
to offer a resale program in the contingency quarters operation but have the front desk
clerks remain military? Is there a need to hire specialized position like marketing due to a
lack of capability? Is there a need for contracted contingency quarters clerks which will
require US Nationals for government network access? Make sure the requirement for what
is needed to be accomplished via a contract solution is clearly defined.
10.13.7.4. Time. Different contracting initiatives take different amounts of time for a
contract to be awarded. The fastest awarded contract type is most likely a local contract.
Prime RIBS may elect to start with a local contract to increase capability and reduce
deployed manpower strain while working to establish an AFCAP contract for long-term

enactment. Table 10.7, Deployment Phases shows the deployment phases and when
contracts are typically started. There is no rule for when to start contracts. It often begins
in the Sustain the Base phase because that is the time when there is better access to
computers to write the contract as well as all of the manpower and resources. Up to this
point, the goal has been to establish and normalize operations. If conditions allow to start
contracting efforts earlier, do not wait until sustainment.
Table 10.7. Deployment Phases
10.13.7.5. Options. The CCO should advise on any military related support agreements
(i.e., host nation, mutual support, or acquisition cross-servicing agreements) that have
been approved for the location. Host countries may have specific requirements for
contracts including what companies are authorized. Always coordinate with the CCO
about contract options available before developing contracts.
• Elements of a Contract. There are multiple individual elements that make-up a
contract. The different elements include the following:
• Performance work statement (PWS) or statement of work (SOW).
• Operation specific appendices.
• Services summary (SS) with performance objectives (PO).
• Definitions.
• Publications and forms.
Deployment Phase
Description
Open the Base
Provides the capabilities to open an airbase, regardless of the 
follow-on mission. Open the base forces normally arrive first and 
assess the airbase for establishment of minimum airfield operating 
parameters, command and control, and supporting host-nation support 
capabilities.
Prime readiness in base services (RIBS) should plan for an initial 
contingency location with austere conditions. Limited manpower and 
resources. 
Operate the Base
Operate the base contains mission support forces needed to achieve 
full operating capability. Forces within this element make the initial 
operating capabilities of the airbase more robust with supplies and 
personnel to sustain forces for a minimum of 30 days.
Prime RIBS has most of the apportioned manpower and resources. 
Begin developing site-specific standards and procedures and begin 
planning for sustainment operations if mission duration permits.
Sustain the Base
Provides additional forces to sustain and robust the capabilities 
already in place from the prior phases.
Prime RIBS begins initiatives to increase quality of life (QoL). 
Sustainment focus areas include blanket purchase agreements (BPA) 
to obtain goods, support contracts, custodial contracts, and transition 
to semipermanent facilities.

10.13.7.6. PWS and SOW are used interchangeably, but they are actually very different. A
PWS defines the requirement in terms of results rather than the method of performing the
work. The requiring activity develops the PWS jointly with the other members of the
multi-functional team. Cite reference directives (e.g., publications, instructions) by
specific process or procedure (e.g., paragraph or chapter) rather than the entire publication
in the PWS. Ensure the PWS is written as performance based unless approved to solicit a
non-performance based acquisition. In that case, a SOW would result, not a PWS.
10.13.7.6.1. The PWS defines what goods and services the government will provide
(e.g., facilities, equipment, vehicles, mail service, computers). and which will be
contractor-provided (e.g., consumable supplies, manpower, vehicles). It also provides
operating location requirements (force protection condition [FPCON], host country
laws, local laws, base access requirements). See Figure 10.1, Performance Work
Statement Example.
Figure 10.1. Performance Work Statement Example
10.13.7.7. Operation Specific Appendices. Operation specific appendices is where Prime
RIBS defines the operational requirements to be performed by the contractor. There can be
multiple appendices depending on the number of functions to be contracted. See Figure
10.2, Operation Specific Appendix Example.

Figure 10.2. Operation Specific Appendix Example
10.13.7.8. Services Summary. The services summary contains performance objectives
and describes the standard the contractor is expected to achieve, how the performance will
be monitored, and the performance threshold. See Figure 10.3, Services Summary
Example.

10.13.7.9. Definitions. The definitions sections defines in clear language key terms and
positions mentioned in the contract. See Figure 10.4, Definitions Example.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-37
 
 
Figure 10.4. Definitions Example
10.13.7.10. Publications and Forms. This is the section that Prime RIBS documents all
publications and forms the contractor must either adhere to or use in the performance of
the contract. See Figure 10.5, Publications and Forms Example.
 
 
10-38
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Figure 10.5. Publications and Forms Example
10.13.7.11. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is not part of the contract, but it
is required to be submitted along with the contract as part of the requirements package.
10.13.7.11.1. The purpose of a QASP is to provide a documented process for
surveilling the contractor’s actual performance and comparing that to the technical
requirements of the contract. The QASP identifies and describes the roles and
responsibilities for implementing and maintaining the key elements of contract
performance management.
10.13.7.11.2. QASP surveillance is based on the minimum surveillance necessary to
assess contractor compliance to PWS requirements. The services summary is
releasable to the contractor, but the QASP is an internal Government document. After
establishing mission essential and crucial SS items with measurable performance
thresholds, the multifunctional team ensures the QASP builds a surveillance plan that
schedules surveillance of all SS and other PWS/contract items.
10.13.7.11.3. The QASP identifies how contracting officer representatives (COR) link
surveillance of SS items to periodic surveillance reporting and contractor performance
assessment reports (CPAR).
10.13.7.11.4. QASP-related requirements are addressed in several regulatory,
procedural, instructional, and guidance documents. Documents should be consulted for
each particular acquisition to determine an appropriate QASP approach.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-39
 
 
10.13.8. Contract Development. Define what needs to be contracted, experience and
qualifications required, Government or contractor provided goods and services, performance
objectives, and local considerations.
10.13.8.1. Define the Work to be Performed. This is the most difficult and important part
of contract development. Prime RIBS should clearly state all facets of the work to be
performed and to what standard they must be performed. Focus efforts on the desired
outcome and not how to do something. For example, pots and pans must be sanitized in
accordance with the Tri-Service Food Code. This statement tells the contractor what is
required and the desired outcome but does not tell them how to sanitize the pots and pans.
During this phase, consider how to rate a contractor’s performance against the description
of the work to be performed. For instance, stating that the contractor is responsible for
providing an integrated recreation plan to support the base populace is not a requirement
that a COR would be able to grade against. Whereas defining the requirement with specific
numbers or ranges of numbers of events to be planned, is quantifiable and gradable.
10.13.8.2. Experience and Qualifications Required. Clearly state if certain qualifications
are required by the contractor. For example, the recreation program manager shall be a
United States national (USN) and have at a minimum of five (5) years’ experience in
supervising and managing DOD recreation or club management operations. Food service
workers must have current Food Handlers Certification prior to beginning work.
10.13.8.3. Government or Contractor Provided. Based on local conditions, identify which
support, services, and assets will be provided by the government and which will be
contractor-provided.
10.13.8.4. Performance Objectives. Develop the standards of performance, how they will
be monitored, and performance thresholds for any references in the contract that prescribe
a standard.
10.13.8.5. Local Considerations. Investigate local requirements that will impact
contracted operations and make sure they are identified in the PWS. Everything from base
access, escort requirements, driving on base, and hours of operation should be clearly
documented in the PWS.
10.13.9. Contract Award Process. After there is a fully developed PWS provided to the
CCO, there are multiple required actions before the contract can be awarded. Pre-solicitation,
the CCO will scrutinize the contract, and seek legal counsel where appropriate or required, to
ensure it is legally sufficient and the performance requirements are clear. The contract will
also be costed, to develop a rough order of magnitude (ROM) or estimate of how much the
contract will cost. Using the ROM, work with FM to secure funds so contracting can initiate
the formal acquisition process. See Figure 10.6, Contract Award Process.
 
 
10-40
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Figure 10.6. Contract Award Process
10.13.10. Solicitation Process. This is when the CCO releases a request for proposal (RFP)
to contractors to bid on the contract. Depending on the strategy, Prime RIBS members should
expect requests for information (RFI) to answer questions the contractors may have as well as
possible site visits. During this time, potential contractors are trying to determine the scope of
the work to be performed so they can accurately propose (bid) the contract solicitation.
10.13.11. Evaluation of Proposals. Once the deadline for solicitation passes, the CCO will
evaluate each of the proposals according to the solicitation factors to determine if the
contractor can satisfy contract requirements. Since Prime RIBS members are the technical
experts, be prepared to assist the CCO in answering any technical or workload questions they
may have.
10.13.12. Source Selection and Contract Award. During this phase, a contractor will be
selected and notified of contract so that work can begin. Note that the time between contract
award and start of performance can be lengthy depending on host nation visa requirements.
10.13.13. Contract Administration. Once the contract has been awarded and work has
begun, the CCO is the only authorized person who can obligate the US Government.
10.13.14. Quality Oversight. A guiding principle to quality is that the level of surveillance is
commensurate with the level of risk associated with contractor performance.
10.13.14.1. All activities that use contractors to perform mission requirements should
have a copy of the contract readily available within the activity. All Prime RIBS members
within the activity should be well-versed on the requirements in the contract. Too often
there are complaints that contractors are failing to meet performance requirements, but the
staff working alongside the contractors do not know what is actually in the contract.
Quality oversight starts within the activity and is the first step in validating it receives the
services contracted for.
10.13.14.2. The COR is the formally appointed technical expert who provides guidance to
Prime RIBS members regarding contractual requirements. The COR performs mandatory

surveillance and documents contractor performance in accordance with the PWS and the
performance objectives within the Services Summary.
10.13.15. Government’s Role. The Government’s role is to ensure it receives the services
contracted for and only pays for the services actually received. The government’s approach to
quality is documented in the QASP/Award Fee or Incentive Plan. In accordance with Federal
Acquisition regulation (FAR) 46.201(b), the contracting officer may also authorize contractor
recommended inspection alternatives when in the Government’s interest and approved by the
mission owner.
10.13.16. Contractor’s Role. The contractor’s role is to ensure the quality of services they
provide is captured in their internal quality management system (QMS).
10.13.17. COR Training. COR training has 2 phases.
10.13.17.1. Phase 1—DOD Standardized COR Training and Certification. DOD has
established a COR certification standard, which defines minimum COR competencies,
training, and experience according to the nature and complexity of the requirement and
contract performance risk.
10.13.17.2. Phase 2—CCO and Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC) Led
Training. CCOs and QAPC ensure CORs receive contract specific training (to include
refresher training). The training should be provided prior to contract award or the COR
assuming contract oversight responsibilities when replacing another COR.
10.13.17.3. The QAPC (or CCO if no QAPC) will provide Phase 2 training covering the
following:
• COR duties/responsibilities to be delegated.
• Multifunctional team members and their roles and responsibilities.
• Importance of COR performance.
• Personal conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest.
• Unauthorized commitments.
• Ethics/integrity in relationships with the CCO, COR management (e.g., supervisor,
functional commander/directors), and the contractor.
• The Seven Step Service Acquisition Process which can be found at:
http://sam.dau.mil/.
• A discussion of the contract, performance work statement, and quality assurance
surveillance plan.
• An awareness of any areas in the contract susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse.
• Creation, maintenance, and submission of all quality assurance documentation and
contractor performance assessment information required by the contract and applicable
regulations.
10.13.18. COR Files. CORs should keep a file for each contract they are responsible for. At a
minimum, each file should contain:
• COR letter of appointment/designation.
• Copy of the contract and all modifications.
 
 
10-42
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
• Copy of acceptance documents and invoices.
• Copies of all contract related correspondence.
• Memoranda of record for all actions taken/issues addressed.
• QASP.
• Performance assessments/reports (negative and positive).
• Weather reports (if applicable to your contracts).
10.13.18.1. Assist the CCO with development of contract modification requests to make
requirements due to poor planning, unforeseen impacts, or mission changes. Once
modification requests have been coordinated, funded, and approved, submit the request
package to the responsible CCO to modify the contract
10.13.18.2. Ensure COR files are transferred and made available to the CCO, COR
management, and the successor COR, if one is designated by the CCO.
10.14. Conducting AAFES Operations. AAFES provide health and hygiene items for sale and
essential services to service members and authorized individuals at approved operating locations.
An Exchange operation may be established at any federal or state installation and other locations
where DOD military personnel are assigned. All AAFES resale outlets will be operated and
controlled either directly or indirectly by AAFES, regardless of location.
10.14.1. Requests for Support. All requests for Exchange support should be routed through
either the MAJCOM or theater component services planner. This includes requests to establish
AAFES operations and concessionaires as they best understand the unique requirements of
their AOR and often have a MOU that outlines specific responsibilities for AAFES support.
10.14.2. Guidance. AAFES guidance is found in EOPs which provide detailed guidance,
much like AFIs and AFMANs, for conducting AAFES operations. The source EOP for a
particular operation (imprest fund or tactical field exchange) is referenced within the
applicable sections so the user knows where to find the data. The MAJCOM or theater
component services planner should have these available upon request.
10.14.3. AAFES Partnership. Traditionally, the element containing Prime RIBS forces has
been the liaison between AAFES and the installation commander. Thus, it is important for
Prime RIBS to understand AAFES capabilities and be prepared to advise leadership. Any
changes in mission that increases or decreases the population (to include rotations) should be
discussed with AAFES since their support is tied to the population size. Failure to include
AAFES in planning can have devastating effects on their supply of health and hygiene items,
to include resupply.
10.14.3.1. AAFES and Prime RIBS have a good relationship and a history of working
together to improve the morale and welfare of deployed forces. The success of the
operations and programs offered is often directly tied to the strength and understanding of
the relationships formed.
10.14.4. Exchange Support. AAFES is the national level provider of military exchange
items and services. When requested and resourced by the supported commander, AAFES
serves as a supporting organization providing military exchange items and services to US
forces, and other authorized customers, deployed for or conducting humanitarian or
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
10-43
 
 
contingency operations and exercises. In a contingency theater of operations or military
exercises where regular AAFES facilities are not available, commanders may request AAFES
support. See Figure 10.7, AAFES Request Example.
Figure 10.7. AAFES Request Example
10.14.4.1. There are three types of AAFES field support available for military operations
and training exercises worldwide. Before attempting to establish a military-operated
AAFES operation, the selected unit should coordinate with FM to validate financial
support is available. Cash handling and support is required. Consider FM’s ability to
support currencies (e.g., cash, local currency, Eagle cash, check) to develop a full
understanding of potential operational shortfalls in advance of requests.
10.14.4.2. AAFES Imprest Fund Activity (AIFA). EOP 08-01, The AAFES Imprest Fund
Activities provides guidance and outlines the procedures to establish, operate, and
deactivate an AIFA. An AIFA is a military-operated AAFES activity, usually in a small or
remote site, where a regular direct-operation exchange cannot be provided. The inventory
has a small dollar value, normally less than $15K. On an exception basis, the inventory can
be approved for up to $50K by the theater exchange commander.
10.14.4.2.1. It is important for Prime RIBS to understand that any unit can operate an
AIFA. If there are future plans that the CL may establish a NAFI, it is highly
recommended that the unit containing Services are not appointed to operate the AIFA.
This removes any possible appearances of conflict of interest and cleanly separates
AIFA and NAFI roles and responsibilities.
 
 
10-44
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
10.14.4.2.2. Obtaining support will require the installation commander to contact the
Component Services Planner who will in-turn coordinate with the theater’s AAFES
servicing exchange designated general manager (GM) for required information in the
request to obtain support. Units submit the request through their component or
MAJCOM A1 for approval and forward the submission to the appropriate combatant
command (CCMD) for final approval.
10.14.4.2.3. Units operating an AIFA will be given a change fund, purchase
merchandise for stocking and restocking from AAFES only, and sell at AAFES set
prices. AAFES issues operating procedures to activate, operate, and deactivate the
AIFA. Unit commanders appoint a commissioned, warrant, or SNCO to supervise the
AIFA, be accountable for the AAFES assets loaned, and to furnish all AIFA
administrative and logistical support. The unit is responsible for re-supply, to include
ordering and transporting merchandise.
10.14.4.3. Tactical Field Exchange (TFE). EOP 08-06, Military/Exchange-Operated
Tactical Exchanges provides guidance and outlines the procedures to establish, operate
and deactivate a TFE. A TFE is operated by the military, usually in remote locations. TFE
operators are trained by AAFES personnel. The TFE operates using AAFES standard
operating procedures, and merchandise is pushed to these facilities by AAFES distribution
centers with APF support as required in the theater of operation.
10.14.4.3.1. Same as with an AIFA, any unit can operate a TFE. If there are future
plans that the CL may establish a NAFI, it is highly recommended that services do not
operate the TFE.
10.14.4.4. Direct Operating Exchange-Tactical (DOX-T). A DOX-T is operated by
AAFES civilian personnel. The DOX-T operates using AAFES operating procedures, and
merchandise will be procured through AAFES distribution channels with APF support as
required in the theater of operation. AAFES normally will not operate a DOX-T or deploy
AAFES associates in non-permissive or combat environments.
10.14.4.4.1. DOX-T Planning Factors. EOP 08-02, Activation, Deactivation and
Transfer of Exchanges is the reference source to establish, operate and deactivate
exchange operations to include DOX-Ts. If approved for a DOX-T operation, Prime
RIBS should be aware of the AAFES Contingency Planning Matrix which prescribes
the minimal recommended services and sizing by troop strength. See Figure 10.8,
AAFES Contingency Planning Matrix.

support forward deployments, ships at sea, emergency and disaster relief efforts, international
exercises, and contingency operations.
10.14.5.1. Stock Assortment Limitation. Limitations and controls on the sale of any
exchange merchandise may be authorized by the AAFES director and chief executive
officer. Many times, these limitations are operational constraints caused by limits imposed
on the availability of supply. Installation commanders may also ask the AAFES GM to
establish limitations when local conditions warrant such action. To resolve disputes over
limitations on goods sold, installation commanders should forward requests for resolution
through command channels, including appropriate department staff elements, to the
AAFES director and chief executive officer. Any dispute over limitations on goods sold
not resolved at command level may be presented to the AAFES executive secretary for
resolution by the AAFES board of directors.
10.14.5.2. Primacy. AAFES has primacy resale authority which means first right of
refusal. Non-incidental MWR programs may operate any AAFES resale operation after
obtaining written right of first refusal from AAFES. Any restrictions or prohibitions
pertaining to AAFES operation also apply to MWR operation. Such resale activities are
required to be NAF-operated, NAF-managed, or NAF-contracted.
10.14.5.3. If Prime RIBS wants to enter into a NAF contract with a potential
concessionaire which would be a non-incidental program, AAFES is given the opportunity
first to do so. If AAFES elects to do so, then services is not permitted. If AAFES declines
the offer, services should receive the denial in writing, file it in the LOF and LOD files for
future use, and then work with the CCO to develop a contract.
10.14.5.4. Resolution of disagreements concerning the primacy of AAFES resale
authority or AAFES ability to provide requested merchandise and services resides with the
appropriate MAJCOM or component commander.
10.14.6. Retail Selection. The AAFES director and chief executive officer determines what
is sold in AAFES facilities, either directly or by concessionaire. An AAFES contractor or
concessionaire selling or providing authorized services is entitled to the same APF support
that AAFES is entitled to when providing like services.
10.14.6.1. Below is a list of the most common contingency revenue-generating activities
AAFES is authorized to operate. The full list can be found in AFI 34-211(I), Morale,
Welfare, and Recreation Army and Air Force Exchange Service Operations, Appendix C.

Example.
Figure 10.9. AAFES Concessionaire Request Example
10.14.7. MWR Resale Authority. MWR programs may engage in resale activities and
services that are directly related to their program as defined in MWR departmental regulations.
Such resale activities, including membership clubs (open messes), restaurants, cafeterias, and
snack bars incidental to MWR programs, should be NAF-operated, NAF-managed, or
NAF-contracted. Otherwise, military exchanges will be the primary source of resale
merchandise and services on DOD installations. MWR programs should obtain in advance the
written right of first refusal from AAFES to operate any other resale or service activity.
10.14.8. NAFI Purchase Prices. EOP 40-35, September 2015, Annex A, Item 1A-2, Page 1,
Organizational/Activity Sales states most NAF purchases (not the gift cards) from AAFES are
authorized a 10 percent discount. Personnel making NAF purchases may need to be identified
in a letter from the EFSS commander to AAFES. To assist AAFES in ensuring they have
adequate stocks to meet requirements, Prime RIBS personnel should forecast requirements in
advance and in writing. They should coordinate with AAFES to determine how far in advance
 
 
10-48
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
requirements should be identified. Below are the most common types of purchases and the
purchase prices:

NAF activities selling alcoholic beverages by the drink on a priority basis. Any AAFES
sales to MWR and NAF activities will be at landed cost. MWR and NAF activities are not
authorized to resell packaged alcoholic beverages for less than full AAFES retail price.
10.14.9. Motion Picture Service. AFI 34-211, Chapter 12 addresses the AAFES motion
picture services to include the procedures to request support. A written request for
establishment of motion picture service should be submitted to appropriate CONUS region
director or overseas region commander through command channels, sufficiently in advance of
requirement for service. AAFES determines the type of service to be provided.
10.14.10. Film Showings. AAFES controls all aspects of film showings. Below is a list of
items for planning consideration for offering AAFES film service:
10.14.10.1. Headquarters (HQ) AAFES procures all feature length cinema motion
pictures for AAFES exhibition at theaters on Air Force installations, to include
contingency locations.
10.14.10.2. AAFES has the exclusive authority to obtain films from industry distributing
companies.
10.14.10.3. Motion picture films, videocassettes, and digital versatile discs are not shown
to support fund-raising activities.
10.14.10.4. Motion picture facilities are intended for the purpose of motion picture
entertainment. All non-military uses are subordinate. The facility will be known as an
entertainment motion picture theater only during the period when used for the paid
admission exhibition of cinema motion pictures.
10.14.10.5. Installation commanders provide APFs to equip, operate, and maintain theater
facilities to include seating. Maintenance of facilities includes maintenance of the grounds
and structures or the outdoor areas approved for presenting entertainment motion picture
programs.
10.14.10.6. Marquees, theater changeable letter signs, one sheet display frames, and
sound and projection equipment are used for approved performances of entertainment

10.14.10.7. Garrison and installation commanders should appoint a building custodian for
the theater facility when it is used for purposes other than a paid admission theater.
10.14.10.8. The cancellation of motion picture showings to promote attendance at other
recreational or athletic activities or the observance of religious holidays is not authorized.
10.14.10.9. Guests may attend motion picture theaters; provided they are accompanied by
personnel authorized exchange privileges.
10.14.10.10. Admission charges are established by the AAFES director and chief
executive officer. There are special provisions in AFI 34-211, Chapter 12 that may permit
special shows and other uses with no admission charges.
10.14.10.11. Videocassette showings are to be on a free admission basis, unless paid
admission service is approved by the AAFES director and chief executive officer. Free

Chapter 11
CH11 AIRMEN SUPPORT AND SUSTAINMENT
AIRMAN SUPPORT AND SUSTAINMENT
11.1. Overview. As part of the AFFORGEN concept (formerly AEF), the A1 community
provides warfighters with key functional capabilities during all phases of an establishing a
deployed AEW and/or AEG. During the robust phase of deployed operations, the EFSS expands
their operational capability with increased support for PERSCO personnel programs, testing
control centers, advanced learning centers, postal, administration services, and Airman and
Family Readiness programs. A1 capabilities residing outside the EFSS are provided to support
deployed commanders and assigned Airmen for the sexual assault prevention and response
(SAPR), equal opportunity, and protocol programs.
11.2. Sustainment. The sustainment phase marks a transition from the set-up phase where the
majority of the main operating force has arrived and completed in-processing actions. The
sustainment phase can occur any time after arriving at the operating location and lasts until a
build-up, surge, or redeployment. During the sustainment phase, the PERSCO Team continues to
maintain Total Force accountability, strength reporting, and provides personnel program advice.
Sustainment operations normally start once the population has reached 1,650 personnel and initial
deployment phase is over 30 days.
11.2.1. Scope. The sustainment scope of operations is determined by HAF/A1, component
command, and AFPC/DP2WR. Consider length of deployment and resource availability when
determining the scope of operations.
11.2.2. Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). Capability to produce
CAC can be limited based on the scope of operations. DEERS availability should be addressed
in the planning phase and establishment of CONOPS to ensure UTC capabilities are aligned.
Member will be identified via UTC MISCAP and/or component reporting instructions if
DEERS training and qualification is required. IFB and IFG are the designations for the
DEERS training required.
11.2.2.1. An on-site DEERS machine requires a member identified as DEERS operator
prior to arrival at deployed location. Member is required to possess a DEERS and real-time
automated personnel identification system (RAPIDS) logon and validation of required
credentials upon arrival at deployed location.
11.2.2.2. DEERS operator is responsible for establishing CAC procedures at the PERSCO
site. Procedures should include availability for 24/7 operation, number of DEERS certified
operators, CAC personal information number (PIN) reset options, and location of DEERS
station in relation to PERSCO team. DEERS/RAPIDS monitor is responsible for ordering
CAC supplies, DEERS system set-up and troubleshooting, and general operation of
DEERS/RAPIDS machine.
11.2.2.3. Off-site DEERS machines are centrally located with an AOR. The scope of
operations should determine need for on site or off-site capabilities. When CAC issuance
capability is not available, PERSCO will work with a DEERS location to determine
transportation for personnel requiring updated CAC. A PIN reset capability should be
established through local communications personnel for immediate assistance.
 
 
11-2
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
11.2.3. Deployed Virtual Military Personnel Flight (dvMPF). This is an application
extension of the military personnel data system (MilPDS) to provide PERSCO capability for
retrieval of basic personnel information of deployed members. The access is updated by
AFPC/DP2WR once a member is in a Duty Status 20 and has an arrival at a deployed location.
There is a separate handbook that explains dvMPF screens. This area will allow you to request
reports on individual personnel (RIP) and accomplish necessary actions for casualty reports.
11.2.3.1. An Automated Military Justice Analysis and Management System (AMJAMS)
RIP request is utilized to retrieve data on personnel receiving non-judicial punishment.
This should only be requested once notified by a commander and deployed legal office.
11.2.3.1.1. RIP request is used to accompany a request for decoration from the
deployed location.
11.2.3.2. Enlisted promotion information is used to validate members availability to
promote to next rank.
11.2.3.3. Enlisted and officer performance report (EPR/OPR) shell is utilized to complete
letter of evaluation (LOE) for deployed personnel. Most personnel will not receive
EPR/OPRs in a deployed area unless directed by commander.
11.2.3.4. Records review RIP is utilized to provide general information on personnel by a
deployed commander. Squadron commanders may request them for inbound personnel or
be utilized during non-judicial punishment. All casualty reports are required to have a
records review RIP accompany the initial casualty report.
11.2.3.5. Record of emergency data is used when accomplishing a casualty report.
11.2.4. Promotions. Deployed promotions are managed by the deployed commander based
on required promotion release data and validation from PERSCO team chief. Personnel that
have a line number should bring a signed promotion recommendation from their home station
commander.
11.2.4.1. Promotion rosters are received from AFPC/DP2WR approximately 3 days prior
to official promotion release or concurrently with senior rater release.
11.2.4.2. Promotion rosters are posted on AFPC/DP2WR SIPRNET SharePoint® for
review. PERSCO team representatives should be MSgt or above and are considered a
trusted agent.
11.2.4.3. Upon arrival at deployed location, requests for release of promotion data are sent
to AFPC/DP2WR on SIPRNET with member’s personal data and deployed location.
11.2.4.4. Once a promotion roster is released, an email notification should be sent to
designated representatives with procedures for review of data. Release of promotion data
to unauthorized personnel is punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ.
11.2.4.5. Supplemental promotions and promotion incremental numbers are posted to
AFPC/DP2WR SIPRNET Microsoft SharePoint® as they are made available.
11.2.5. Total Force Service Center (TFSC). The AFPC personnel call center is available to
deployed personnel and PERSCO teams 24/7 and can provide general policy information or
assistance with deployed personnel actions. The TFSC can be reached numerous ways to
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
11-3
 
 
include via telephone at 1-800-525-0102, Right Now Technologies (RNT), and the case
management system (CMS).
11.2.5.1. RNT is the application utilized when contacting the TFSC. Personnel are able to
initiate personal RNT cases via the MyPers website or contact TFSC to open a case. RNT
allows for questions, updates, or general guidance to be routed via a TFSC technician who
will evaluate the question and either respond with appropriate answer or send the case to
the SME. Policy related questions will be forwarded to policy branch for answer.
11.2.5.2. CMS is available to all deployed PERSCO team members. Upon arrival at
deployed location, PERSCO members should submit CMS access via AFPC/DP2WR
SIPRNET SharePoint®. Required information includes name, SSN, telephone number,
and email address.
11.2.5.2.1. Some members may have CMS access from home station and will need to
be aligned under deployed PERSCO CMS access and then returned to home station
account upon departure.
11.2.5.2.2. CMS allows for PERSCO team to work with home station or AFPC on
matters relating to a member’s personal career. Examples of items available for
processing via CMS are re-enlistments and extensions to include necessary paperwork
for re-enlistment in deployed AOR, changes to assignment actions, requests for
retraining, and assistance with evaluations. Be cognizant of OPSEC rules and do not
release information that could be classified (PID/ULN/location) via unsecure
applications.
11.2.6. Awards and Decorations. Establish a local CCMD specific decoration process.
CCMD/A1 should determine available decorations during an operation. Decorations may be
reviewed locally and processed via CCMD decoration office. Proper coordination with CCMD
and AFPC decorations office should be done upon establishment of sustainment operations.
11.2.7. General PERSCO Operations. All deployments are not the same and all PERSCO
responsibilities are not exact. The general PERSCO sustainment operation can be different
from team to team within the same AOR. As part of the sustainment operation set-up, below
are some items that should be established to ensure continued successful PERSCO operations.
11.2.7.1. Continuity Books. A well-established continuity book will provide the
foundation for future PERSCO team’s success. It is important that in the initial beddown
the continuity book is started. The book should contain guidance and policy on PERSCO
rules and responsibilities. Important parts are POCs, reporting instructions, CONOPS, and
established in-and-out processing procedures. A continuity book compiles processes into
one central location for easy access allowing for easy transition from one team to another.

11.2.7.2. Emergency Leave. When initial beddown procedures are complete, an
emergency leave process should be established. While emergency leave is not expected in
the first 30 days, building an emergency leave process and checklist should streamline
processing when notified by the Red Cross, First Sergeant, or commander of emergency
leave situations. This may also require an early release message due to the nature of the
emergency.
11.2.7.3. Air Force Reserve (ARC)/ANG Support. Familiarization with ARC/ANG
processes should be accomplished as rules on extension, departures, or changes require Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG) approval. Making contact
with AFRC and ANG on deployment policy and procedures along with written guidance
thru CCMD CONOPS should be established. Status of recall procedures
(volunteer/non-volunteer, partial/full mobilization) may require different processing
actions.
11.2.7.4. Augmentation Support. During initial beddown and the start of sustainment
operations, other augmented duties may arise. Examples include security force augmentee,
mailroom assistance, transportation augmentation, or other support as determined by
deployed commander. The PERSCO accountability and casualty mission cannot stop and
availability to support additional mission partners should be based upon excess capacity
with the PERSCO mission.
11.2.8. Reports and Templates. During the sustainment phase PERSCO roles include daily
reports, in and out processing checklist templates, local procedure establishment, and general
support capabilities. See Table 11.2, Routing Requirements.

11.2.8.2.6. Ensure documents meet the intent and provide required data for
approval/disapproval. Mandatory items will include name, SSN, unit of assignment,
ULN/unit line remark (/LNR), justification, and endorsement from the deployed
commander with final approval by CCMD/A1.
11.2.8.2.7. There will be different variations of the document—release without
replacement and release with replacement. Refer to DAFI 36-3802, Force Support
Readiness Programs for guidance (e.g., requirements with over 30 days remaining on
a tour may request replacement). The deployed commander has final decision.
11.2.8.3. Standard Report. DCAPES produces standard reports for use at deployed
location. The reports are designed to ease the PERSCO team chief’s ability to manage in
and outbound personnel. See Figure 11.1, DCAPES Standard Reports
11.2.8.3.1. Alpha Roster. PERSCO Teams provide alpha rosters to units. Units will
review alpha rosters to maintain accountability by identifying personnel who have
departed or have not in-processed. The PERSCO Team then takes appropriate action to
capture changed unit information. Recommend a representative from each unit and
PERSCO member meet face to face on a weekly basis and review the unit’s

accountability rosters to ensure there is no difference between the personnel physically
in the unit and what PERSCO reflects in system.
11.2.8.3.2. Employment Requirement Manning Document (ERMD). Identifies the
number and types of requirements projected to the deployed location. It can be used to
monitor force build-up, identify unfilled positions, and replacement actions (identified
by an “R” position suffix).
11.2.8.3.3. Duplicate Position Report. Identifies multiple personnel assigned to the
same requirement position. PERSCO Teams should validate identified personnel
records and notify the appropriate IPR to delete the erroneous DCAPES data.
11.2.8.3.4. Requirements Mismatch Report. Used to validate PERSCO-captured
information so PERSCO Teams can correct erroneous or mismatched conditions. Use
this product to identify personnel records containing PID data not matching the
validated plans received from the component command, possible shortfalls, and
erroneous data in the DCAPES system.
11.2.8.3.5. Unfilled Requirements Report. This is a preformatted report identifying all
unfilled requirements within 60 calendar days of required delivery date (RDD). Report
is sent to supporting commands and FSS for their action.

11.4. Postal and Administration. All 3F5XX positions are postured according to AFFORGEN
principles and may be tasked to fulfill requirements as needed by any combatant commander.
11.4.1. Significance. Postal support during wartime is a critical logistics and morale issue.
Planning for the handling and routing of mail, as well as the operation of military post offices
(MPO), aerial mail terminals (AMT), and mail control activities (MCA), should be included
with other operations planning to ensure the military postal service (MPS) operates as an
integrated and efficient system. Neglecting postal support can have significant negative impact
on the overall combat effectiveness of assigned forces.
11.4.2. References. See Table 11.7, Postal References.

11.4.3.2.1. Manpower requirements (coordinated with MAJCOM/A1). Postal
manpower is based on a ratio of one qualified 3F5XX per 500 personnel as a starting
point. Other factors to consider are the extent of services (e.g., finance, official mail).
EXAMPLE: If a location is assigned 500 personnel but is also required to perform mail
transportation functions, a second 3F5XX may be needed. These factors are referred to as
variations and should be considered in all planning input. See Table 11.8, Planning Matrix.
Table 11.8. Planning Matrix
11.4.3.2.2. Structural criteria (coordinated with MAJCOM/A3). Refer to DODI
4525.09, Military Postal Service, Section 3.4 for specific requirements on structural
criteria. It is important to understand that most contingency sites will not conform to
the requirements as outlined in this document. Every effort should be made to ensure
the location is as compliant as possible.
11.4.3.2.3. Site survey data (coordinated with MAJCOM/A3). Because postal
personnel may not be included on site survey teams, MAJCOM/A3s have been
provided with a checklist to use as a tool for evaluating the needs of postal operating
locations.
11.4.3.3. Upon notification of planning requirements, MAJCOM/A1RP should convene a
postal planning cell with MAJCOM/AIRPS. MAJCOM/A1RP should brief the operation
and the requirements to AIRPS and sister Services as required. In turn, they should task
AIRPS to provide the required information.
11.4.3.3.1. Transportation requirements (coordinated with MAJCOM/AIRPS).
11.4.3.3.2. Mailing restrictions (coordinated with MAJCOM/AIRPS).

Forward these requests to MPSA for review and approval.
11.4.5. Free Mail (FM). FM is authorized under Title 39 USC § 3401, Mailing privileges of
members of Armed Forces of the United States. Originally authorized only by the President,
the authority was delegated in Executive Order 12556, Military Mail Privileges to the
Secretary of Defense (SecDef) in 1989 to expedite implementation.
11.4.5.1. FM is limited to letter mail, sound or video recorded communications, and photo
mailers having characteristics of personal correspondence (not to exceed 13 ounces) to a
place within the delivery limits of the United States Postal Service (USPS) or MPS.
11.4.5.2. The combatant commander in conjunction with the SSM develop FM requests.
The requests are submitted directly to MPSA.

notification.
11.4.7. UTC Requirements. To provide general information on postal UTCs, the mission
capability (MISCAP) for each postal UTC is provided as well as an example of how these
assets are used in a contingency environment.
11.4.7.1. Reporting Instructions. Reporting instructions are used to tailor a UTC by
further defining the capability needed.
11.4.7.2. UTC Components. A UTC is an alphanumeric, five-character code used to
identify a standard combat or support force capability. A UTC may be personnel only or
equipment only. Most UTCs consist of two separate parts:
11.4.7.2.1. MISCAP. The MISCAP statement describes the capabilities of the UTC,
what the force can do, and the conditions under which it will deploy.
11.4.7.2.2. Manpower Detail. The manpower portion of a UTC to accomplish the
mission as stated in the MISCAP.
11.4.7.3. Postal UTCs. Postal primarily uses 4 UTCs to deploy for contingency Air Postal
Office (APO), AMT, and MCA operations.
11.4.7.3.1. One 3F531— trained in postal finance, official mail, receipt/dispatch, and
registered mail duties as outlined in Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS)
3F5X1. When included in the TPFDD, the associated skill level that is loaded in the
 
 
11-22
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) is 3-skill level. Reporting
instructions will be utilized to further define this requirement.
11.4.7.3.2. This UTC is employed for basic APO/AMT/MCA functions. All locations
with APO operations will train their personnel to the levels specified in the MISCAP.
11.4.7.3.3. One 3F551—trained in Stock Custodian/Custodian of Postal Effects
(SC/COPE), retail sales system (RSS), postal finance, registered mail, and
receipt/dispatch procedures as outlined AFJQS 3F5X1. May perform as postmaster of
a small APO or as an assistant postmaster. When included in the TPFDD, the
associated skill level that is loaded in the MEFPAK is 5-skill level. Reporting
instructions will be utilized to further define this requirement.
11.4.7.3.4. This UTC is employed for APO/AMT/MCA locations where member will
be serving in a supervisor position. All locations with APO operations will train their
personnel to the levels specified in the MISCAP.
11.4.7.3.5. One 3F571—responsible for postmaster and postal superintendent
positions. Requires experience in operating an APO or serving on a postal headquarters
staff. Should understand all APO duties as outlined in 3F5X1 AFJQS. When included
in the TPFDD, the associated skill level that is loaded in the MEFPAK is 7-skill level.
Reporting instructions will be utilized to further define this requirement.
11.4.7.3.6. This UTC is employed for APO/AMT/MCA locations where member will
be serving in a postmaster, detachment chief, or postal superintendent. All locations
with APO operations will train their personnel to the levels specified in the MISCAP.
11.4.7.4. RFDA (Postal Augmentee). One X 3F5X1—Active duty, Air Reserve, or Guard
Component in skill levels of 3, 5, or 7 coming from CONUS. Individual will augment
postal operations by performing various duties as required at the deployed location. Duties
may include but are not limited to; pitching and sorting mail, finance, registry, and loading
or off-loading mail containers. No prior postal experience is required as members will
either attend the basic postal course at the Joint Military Postal School at Ft. Jackson, SC,
if time and class schedule permits, or will receive on-the-job training (OJT).
11.4.7.4.1. This UTC is employed to augment postal operations at either APO or
AMT/MCA locations. Due to the short supply of postal qualified personnel
augmentation is required to build and maintain appropriate experience.
11.4.8. Postal Role in AFFORGEN Environment. Postal personnel deploy in the RFDB
UTC series. All personnel are postured across the AFFORGEN cycle. To ensure personnel are
prepared for deployment, supervisors should take the following items into consideration prior
to posturing:
11.4.8.1. Posturing. Utilizing the unit manning document (UMD), MAJCOM A1 has
dictated what authorized rank will be assigned to each position in the AFFORGEN cycle.
This is necessary because there should be an equitable spread of postal assets throughout
the command. For instance, if all of the MSgt positions were postured in one rotation,
postal would not be able to fill contingency requirements for MSgts during the rest of the
cycle. Commanders should carefully posture all ranks through AFFORGEN phases as
prescribed in the Force Support Prioritization and Sequence Guide.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
11-23
 
 
11.4.8.1.1. Commanders are responsible for posturing their personnel in accordance
with the aforementioned guidance. When entering the data ensure complete names and
ranks are provided.
11.4.8.1.2. The status of an individual in training is entered in training status column
via a stop light method. For instance, if an individual is completely qualified, their
status is reflected as green, if partially qualified yellow, and if just arrived on station
and not yet entered into initial training or if the position is unfilled the status would be
red.
11.4.8.1.3. Commanders should provide comments on all individuals whose training
status is reflected as red or yellow. Comments should provide a snapshot of the
individual’s current training status and a get well date (GWD) for completion of
training. Example— “SrA Nichols is trained in all areas except finance, his GWD is 15
Jan.”
11.4.8.2. UTA. This tool is used by UDMs to report on the status of all postured
personnel. Commanders certify that the data in AFFORGEN UTC reporting tool (ART) is
a true reflection of unit status and submit their certification through the chain of command
to the MAJCOM. Training status is only one of the criteria used to report. Refer to AFI
10-244 for more information on what factors are considered for status reporting in ART.
11.4.8.2.1. Postal managers should coordinate closely with UDMs to ensure that an
accurate reflection of capabilities is in UTA. MAJCOM functional area managers
should validate this information.
11.4.9. Planning Checklist. This checklist is developed as a guide for postal contingency
planners. This checklist is not all encompassing and should be used as a guide. See Table 11.9,
Postal Planning Checklist.

pieces, and mail volumes for both 
incoming/outgoing mail, air carriers used, 
significant accomplishments, problem areas, 
and other comments.
See fleet management (LRS) for your (MCA

Recommend maps for telephone outage 
situations.
ACTION
Remarks
Conduct site survey to determine location of 
aerial mail terminal (AMT) and/or mail 
control activity (MCA) facility.
Preferably facility(s) should be located on the 
airport (air-side) accessible to all air carriers 
providing MPS service. If off airport, arrange 
vehicle support with Army or contractors and drop 
off/pick-up mail at prearranged location, most

Review the MPM, Section 15 and Appendix 15A: 
Military Postal Activity Design.
Know the population expected to serve. Verify 
with personnel support for contingency 
operations (PERSCO).
Does it have a covered area to exchange mail with 
carriers during inclement weather or can they 
pull/tug mail and containers directly in to the 
facility? 
No existing facility will be perfect and meet all 
required needs. If it meets 75 percent, barring no 
major security or force protection 
issues—arrange to lease.
Security and limited access to facility.
Review structural and security requirements as 
listed in the MPM, Section 15.
Pay particular attention to doors and windows and 
ensure all are lockable. 
Is access restricted to authorized personnel only? 
Is it security guard controlled? 
Does it have a registry cage or area that can be 
converted to a registry area? 
Was an ISU 90 deployed? Can it be used for 
storing regulations? Do you have an expandable 
mobile shop/van container (EVAN)? Can it be 
used for an MCA office? 
Will facility meet standards? 
If facility will not be operational on 24-hour

Contact major command (MAJCOM)/air 
postal squadron (AIRPS), local Air Mobility 
Command (AMC) air transportation 
operations center (ATOC), and/or servicing 
gateway (Joint Military Postal Activity 
[JMPA]) to determine which carriers they 
will be using to support contingency.
Initially, there may be limited lift, possibly only 
AMC. Service may be limited to first class mail 
(FCM)—13 ounces or less. 
Determine daily lift capability by carrier. 
If currently non-approved carriers service the 
location, coordinate with these air carrier 
representatives to determine their lift capabilities, 
routes served, security, and interest in moving 
military mail. 
If all positive, work with MAJCOM/AIRPS to get 
carrier(s) approved in coordination with Military 
Postal Service Agency (MPSA) and United States 
Post Office (USPS).
Meet with air carriers to determine their 
retrograde capabilities. 
Obtain copies of their dispatch schedules. 
Provide estimated projections.
Many factors are involved here but a good 
projection estimate is 5lb per customer served per 
week. If limited to FCM only, the projection will 
be much less. Do not forget equitable tender rules 
and competitive routes (i.e., direct versus one or 
two stop and/or does it involve gage changes).
Refer to US Postal Service Transportation 
Handbook (HBK) T-7, Distribution, Dispatching, 
and Transportation Military Mail by Air. 
All this information will help determine the daily 
dispatch schedule and ramp tour requirements. 
If applicable, designate which flight will be used 
for registered mail (Bird Watch requirement). The 
dispatch schedule should be approved by 
MAJCOM contingency PERSCO Team. Once 
approved, it should be provided to all dispatching 
locations (APO) and updated as required (usually 
quarterly).
Develop some type of routing and labeling 
instruction in automated military postal 
system (AMPS) (e.g., sorting pouching 
routing instruction [SPRINT]).
Chart equivalent, consolidated air massing 
and labeling system (CAMALS), or local

11.5.6.1. Battle Rhythm. Service delivery should be synchronized with the immediate and
anticipated activities of the base’s mission, special events, permanent change of station
rotations, AFFORGEN rotations, and the normal flow of military life-cycle events. By
synchronizing schedules, staff is able to plan when surges focused on a particular area of
service delivery are required (e.g., focusing all the resources of the staff to support an
AFFORGEN rotation or return).
11.5.6.2. Office Considerations. Refer to AFI 36-3009, Airman and Family Readiness
Centers, and UFC 4-730-01, Family Services Centers for additional A&FR programs,
services, and facility recommendations. Deployed staff require personal office space with
sufficient size and privacy to provide for assessment and consultation to consult with
clients. Other required resources needed may include: standard office equipment,
computers, book cases, desk, chairs, classroom for instructing classes, a room with
computers and phones, and a vehicle for transportation to and from units. See Figure 11.5,
M&FRC Resource Requirements.
Figure 11.5. M&FRC Resource Requirements
11.5.7. Conclusion. Since the early 1980s, the M&FRC has been one of the premier success
stories of how to take care of Airmen and their families. M&FRC staff across the Air Force has
worked tirelessly to ensure their communities receive services and programs to support quality
of life and enhance mission readiness of the Total Force and their families. As the Air Force
21. Encourage the use of a military family life consultant (MFLC) (if available) for short-term, 
solution focused, non-medical counseling.
• Issues requiring intervention or treatment should be referred to the appropriate helping
agency.
• Out of scope work defined by DOD should be referred to appropriate providers (e.g.,
long-term mental health issues, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] or other severe trauma
disorders, personality disorders, repeated use of dysfunctional coping mechanisms,
treatment for mental health or substance abuse).

continues to evolve, M&FRCs have changed their method of service delivery to keep step with
the changing needs of the Air Force.
11.6. Deployed Protocol. This section focuses on the duties of the protocol officer and enlisted
UTCs. The protocol officer UTC (LWRRP) can deploy within the Establish the Airbase stage of
the FM construct on or about day three. The enlisted protocol UTC (LWRRQ) arrives in the
Operate the Airbase phase, on or about day 15. The early assignments allow protocol to provide
additional support to the C2 element, assist commanders with host nation support tasks, and
establish an understanding of the local customs and courtesies. Once the construct is established,
a deployment rotation of officer and enlisted protocol will occur, with the goal to maintain and
improve established programs and stay current with local customs and courtesies.
11.6.1. Unique Situations at a Beddown Operation. There are many factors which affect
the way protocol duties are performed in theater to include threat level, security, location,
weather, manning, alcohol restrictions, language barriers, austere living conditions, and shared
work spaces among others.
11.6.1.1. Customs and courtesies related to the deployed location should be understood
and relayed to others. Challenges with cultural differences in how women, minorities,
coalition forces, and enlisted are treated should be considered and understood. These
considerations should be made while keeping in-line with Air Force customs, courtesies,
traditions, and honors.
11.6.1.2. Practice good OPSEC and COMSEC for arriving DVs in a deployed
environment. DV notification reports should be limited and encrypted when sent via email.
11.6.1.3. Protocol Functions. Many deployed locations are inclusive of coalition and
combined operations. Be prepared to work with and for other US military branches as well
as military forces of other nations. For example, an Airman might deploy as a US Air
Force representative, but work for an Australian Chief of Protocol with two US Army
officers. Each country has a senior representative officer, who is usually a general officer.
After arriving at the deployed location, determine the host nation relationship.
11.6.1.4. Base Level. More than likely, the Air Force protocol officer will work with
members from all US branches of the military and may be expected to be the subject
matter expert (SME) in the Air Force culture. Airmen should also learn the culture,
courtesies, traditions, and honors of sister Services and the host nation. Other Services
deploy differently which may require the Air Force protocol officer to cover all DV visits
and sister-Service ceremonies. For example, the US Army protocol office may not deploy
at the onset, but come later when needed.
11.6.1.5. CAOC Level. Working on the AFFOR or CAOC headquarters staff can provide
an expanded view of the theater and afford the opportunity to work planning details for
theater wide visits, including entertainment and DV visits.
11.6.2. DV. According to AFI 34-1201, Protocol DV is defined as: (1) any general or flag
officer; (2) any government official with rank equivalent to a brigadier general or higher; or
(3) any foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary of the Air
Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA). At times, persons of lower rank appointed to or
filling certain positions, may be accorded DV status. The purpose of the visit will determine if
 
 
11-44
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
the distinction of DV should be accorded. The commander determines the DV distinction on
an individual basis.
11.6.2.1. AF/A1LG, Air Force General Officer Management Office (GOMO), publishes a
relative rank roster every month of active duty US Air Force general officers on the Air
Force Portal.
11.6.2.2. AF/CVXS Senior Executive Management publishes a senior executive service
(SES) roster with DV codes for Air Force senior civilians on the Air Force Portal.
11.6.2.3. There are several precedence lists that could apply to a situation, event, or visit
at hand. There is a US order of precedence list, a DOD order of precedence, joint staff
order of precedence, and rosters for each branch of the US Armed Forces. For assistance
obtaining these lists contact the USAF Headquarters Protocol Office, HAF/DSP, by phone
at DSN 227-8341, commercial 703-697-8341, or by email at:
af.protocol.workflow@us.af.mil.
11.6.3. Funding. From AFI 34-1201, there are several sources of funds for protocol-related
expenses. Always refer to financial management policy when determining proper funding
source. When in doubt, consult with a staff judge advocate and financial manager. Remember
to obtain required approval before obligating funds.
11.6.3.1. The best way to determine what type of official funds to use is to evaluate the
guest list and categorize the invitees; ask “how are they coming to you?” this question will
help better understand the role they represent.
11.6.3.2. It is imperative to understand that just because funding is authorized for a
specific individual or group, does not mean that funds are available. Protocol should
manage the funding programs and know how much money is available in the annual
budgets. Funds may be shown as available, however it is possible they are allocated to
reoccurring events.
11.6.3.3. Perception is also very relevant when making purchases with government funds,
be practical with your choices and purchases.
11.6.3.4. APFs are government funds from the public treasury, which are appropriated by
act of Congress to conduct the business of government agencies and activities. The two
most relevant funds for protocol use in this area are ORFs and operations and maintenance
(O&M) funds.
11.6.3.5. Emergency and Extraordinary Expense Authority. Refer to AFI 65-503, US Air
Force Cost and Planning Factors and DODI 7250.13, Use of Appropriated Funds for
Official Representation Purposes for guidance on ORF. The purpose of this budget is to
give commanders the ability to extend official courtesies to foreign personnel, US
government leaders, prominent US citizens, and select senior DOD personnel while on
official visits to the field.
11.6.3.5.1. Annually, each branch of the service allocates specific budgets through the
CCMDs and MAJCOMs, and down to unit level. Budgets are typically determined
based on previous year expenditures. Be sure to become familiar with who qualifies as
an ORFable recipient. When paying for food, be familiar with the ratio of ORFable
attendees to non-qualified ORF recipients.
 
AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
11-45
 
 
11.6.3.5.2. There are two key thresholds. When there are 29 or less total attendees, for
every one ORFable attendee, four non-qualified attendees can be paid for (20/80 ratio).
When there are 30 or more total attendees, for every one ORFable attendee, one
non-qualified attendee can be paid for (50/50 ratio).
11.6.3.5.3. Before giving a gift purchased with ORF money, verify the person’s
qualified status in DODI 7250.13 and AFI 65-503. Unlike the payment of food at
official social functions, gifts can only be given to qualified recipients.
11.6.3.5.4. The most important thing to know about this fund, is that the money must
be approved in advance. Procedures should be established to request approval for the
use of funds for every instance. Refer to AFI 65-503, Attachment 2 for a sample
request form.
11.6.3.6. O&M Funds. Refer to DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1 for guidance on O&M
funds. DAFMAN 65-605, Volume 1 is a large instruction; the main focus area for protocol
is chapter four, which offers funding guidance for honoraria, stationary, business cards,
appliances and furnishings, meals and light refreshments, conferences, meetings, US flags
for retirees, printing of invitations and programs, and much more. Just because it is
authorized, does not mean there is money available. Check with the GPC cardholder,
approving official, and/or budget office.
11.6.3.7. NAFs. These troop funds are derived from profits made by activities such as the
Base Exchange and force support entities such as outdoor recreation and auto hobby shop.
The most relevant type of these funds used in protocol is SM&W.
11.6.3.8. SM&W. AFMAN 34-201, Chapter 12 defines Air Force policy concerning the
request, approval, and use of NAFs for SM&W purposes. The primary use of this money
is to pay for light refreshments at events which are open to all military and DOD civilians.
Funds should be requested and approved in advance and the procedure is normally
outlined by the local NAF accounting office. There are several other authorized purchases,
but this funding source is known to be very limited and vary drastically from one
installation to the next. Acquire the local guidance to know what is allowable. There are no
longer any authorizations for gifts under this funding.
11.6.3.9. When Government funds are not authorized or available, the proper source of
funds is the individual. Ensure to be fiscally responsible when making plans to use
personal funds. In these cases, the event organizers can collect personal funds through
landing or hospitality fees and pay the vendor bills on their behalf. It is recommended to
collect money in advance of the event upon registration to avoid non-paying no show
registered participants.
11.6.4. Use of Facilities. Protocol officers have no dedicated facilities assigned in the BEAR
packages. They rely on facility managers to assist in finding base facilities that are available
for protocol activities. Temporary use of facilities may range from the use of the dining facility
to host a DV luncheon or dinner with the troops, to the use of the recreation center or theater
for a mass briefing. Planning and contact with the facility manager should be accomplished as
early as possible to alleviate a scheduling conflict. This also provides sufficient time to prepare
the facility for the visit and gives time to recruit assistance to help with setup if required.

AFTTP 3-4.34, 16 November 2022
 
11.6.5. Further Guidance. There are many sources for protocol guidance. HQ USAF
Protocol Office has a useful SharePoint® site (https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AF-Protocol) with
information and links to every MAJCOM Protocol office to provide reach-back capability.
The Ira C. Eaker Center for Leadership Development at Maxwell Air Force Base, AL, offers a
protocol fundamentals course to deploying or non-experienced protocol officers,
noncommissioned officers (NCO), and civil service. The World Fact Book is a key site for the
most 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
countries 
and 
world 
leaders
(https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/). The US Department of State protocol deals with
foreign policy and diplomatic engagements (http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/).

any force protection problems? If the situation has changed from initial
plans, consider relocation, rearrangement, or using dispersed facilities.
• Check to see if latrine shelters and shower/shave units can be located in
the optimum services-positions (along contingency quarters primary
access routes to field feeding operations).
• Latrines should be down wind and down slope from quarters and field
feeding operations.
• Meet with civil engineering (CE) to correct problems and determine if
there are any utility support problems (e.g., too rocky or soft soil; being too
remote for adequate water, electrical, or sewerage service).
• Is there adequate area for future expansion? If not, meet with security
forces and CE to determine if using other areas nearby is feasible.
• Are there any existing facilities that are adequate for permanent or
temporary contingency quarters?
• Adequate space for future expansion and future conversion to more
permanent contingency quarters.
Contingency Quarters 
Structures
• War Reserve Materiel (WRM):
1. Tent-based shelter systems. Used primarily for initial operations and to 
support population increases beyond the capacity of semi-permanent and 
permanent facilities.
• Small Shelter System (SSS):
1. Sleeps 12 persons in open/operate ops, 6 to 8 persons in sustainment, 
and 16 persons in surge. Requires 6 persons to erect. Measures 32.5 feet 
long, by 20 feet wide, by 10 feet high (650 square feet [ft2]), and multiple 
shelters can be interconnected. It can withstand steady 50-knot winds and 
gusts up to 60 knots. Requires at least 35 feet by 50 feet.
• Medium Shelter System (MSS):
1. Sleeps up to 30 persons for rotational ops and 40 persons in surge. Re-
quires 6 persons to erect. Used primarily for transient contingency quarters 
to minimize structures required/maximize available space. Can be used as 
a warehouse. Measures 52 feet long by 30 feet wide and 15 feet high 
(1,560 ft2). It can withstand steady 60-knot winds and gusts up to 90 knots. 
The site should be at least 40 feet by 60 feet.

Planning Factors
• Manpower—Two Prime Readiness in Base Services (RIBS) members to
support the first 275 personnel and then one additional Prime RIBS member for
each population increase of 275 personnel.
1. Consider mission and transient requirements when determining the 
manning required to support the operation.
2. Second, contingency quarters may require more manpower than initial 
planning factors during open and operate the base as the cantonment area is 
being constructed.
• The recommended minimum spacing is 12 feet between shelters and 30 feet
between rows of shelters.
1. To make it easier for occupants to locate their facility, it is recommended 
that the rows be named or numbered.
• Try to beddown squadron commanders with squadron commanders.
• Crew Rest—Prime RIBS should ensure crew rest and crew integrity is
maintained for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) that require crew rest.
1. Similar type career fields, aircrews, and aircrews scheduled on the same 
flights, should be kept together.
2. Set up crew-rest quarters in an area adequately separated from noise, 
lighting, traffic, and other disruptions that would interfere with crew rest.
3. Consider the use of existing permanent structures instead of tents to 
reduce noise levels and allow for the maximum amount of crew rest.
• Female Officers and Enlisted—During the planning phase, attempt to obtain
from unit housing representatives (UHR) or personnel support for contingency
operations (PERSCO) the number of females that are inbound. The planning
factor for females is approximately 20 percent of the beddown population.
1. When space is limited, ask the installation commander if it is permissible 
to lodge officers and enlisted females in the same shelter.
2. Lodge all females close to female latrines and showers. Be aware that 
during emergency conditions, temporary partitions in sleeping shelters and 
time-sharing of latrine and shower facilities by males and females may be 
necessary and must be approved by the installation commander.
• Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCO)—The planning factor for all
SNCOs is approximately 13 percent.
1. Chief Master Sergeants should be beddown together.
2. SNCOs should be beddown together within the same unit when practical.
• Department of Defense (DOD) civilian employees should be beddown at the
same standard as their military counterparts. For contractors, beddown will be
accomplished in accordance with their contract or based on installation
commander guidance. Contract personnel should be beddown within the same
facilities.

Population Break-Outs
• Break out the numbers of personnel by types of groups to be supported.
The following are primary categories to be considered:
• Flight crews (e.g., by type of aircraft, expected number of aircraft, crew
numbers).
• Officer and senior officers.
• Enlisted and SNCOs.
• Men and women.
• Civilians.
• Foreign military/visitors.
• Transient and permanent personnel.
• Any special shift crews (e.g., fire station firefighters).
• Any quarters with requirements for higher security (e.g., special mission
or very important persons [VIP]).
• Provide CE with group breakout listings and identify any groups that
must be within contiguous contingency quarters blocks (e.g., flight crews,
officers, females, foreign military).
• Provide CE with a list of existing facilities that will be used for beddown
contingency quarters to allow CE to provide hygiene facilities as
necessary.
• Determine if there are any adequate existing or contract quarters
available in the area.
• Inspect them and the location with security forces, CE, fire department,
medical, and logistics readiness (if transportation is required).
• Establish the timeline for beddown and arrival of personnel.
• Services is responsible for the locator system, but it will not work
without strong backing of the first sergeants and/or UHRs. Finalize with
first sergeants/UHRs the breakout of personnel, who they are responsible
for, and how to make changes to assigned spaces without busting the
locator system.
• Develop detailed maps (with CE) of the contingency quarters
community (e.g., contingency quarters, latrines, shower/shave, dining
facilities, laundry, fitness center[s], recreation facilities, field exchange,
morale communications and/or learning resource center[s]), fire lanes,
utility corridors).

Establish Square Footage 
Standards
• If there is a theater contingency quarters standard for Joint special operations
command (JSOC) units or the theater’s Air Force component, use it as necessary.
• If this is not a JSOC requirement and there are no theater standards, develop a
proposed site/installation contingency quarters standard for the AEW commander.
• The standard contingency quarters UTC provides 12 shelters and cots to support
144 personnel.
• Determine if the number of personnel per type of contingency quarters facility
must be increased during the initial beddown.
• Surge requirements may be implemented allowing for only 40 square feet per
person to increase tent capacity. As more contingency quarters space is obtained
or built, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) planning factors should be met or exceeded
(minimum of 50 ft2 per person).
• Plan for 50 square feet per person during initial operations (Establish and
Operate the Airbase) and increase square footage per person when conditions and
assets allow.
CAUTION: When faced with the situation on whether to increase the number of
personnel per facility (i.e., decrease the allotted square feet per person), check
with medical. During the initial days of the deployment, personnel are often
exposed to conditions that cause respiratory infections. Decreasing square footage
could contribute to more rapid spread of airborne bronchial infections. Limiting
the number of personnel per shelter may be required for health reasons unless
masks are provided and used.
EXAMPLE: For Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) assets (based
on a standard small shelter system tent):
# TENT—Square Feet
12 — 53 ft2 (normal).
8 — 80 ft2 (flight crews, for health conditions, theater directed [e.g., storage
of additional equipment).
16 — 40 ft2 (very short term [e.g., Establish the Base, emergency situations]).
• Try to provide minimum 72 ft2/enlisted and 100 ft2/officer.
• During the initial beddown surge, when personnel are on extended 12 to
18-hour shifts (i.e., only a few personnel are actually sleeping at one time), the
number of personnel per shelter may decrease available space to about 32 ft2 per
person. First check with medical and CE.
• Recommended Robust the Airbase minimum net square footage (NSF) per
person standards:
1. E-1 through E-8, WO-1 through WO-4, O-1 through O-3, civilian (WG-01 
through GS-11) equals 80 NSF per person.
2. E-9; WO-5; O-4 through O-6; civilian equivalent (GS-12 through GS-15) 
equals 160 NSF per person.
3. O-7 and above, senior executive service (SES), NF-6, and distinguished 
visitors (DV) equals 256 NSF per person.
• Special mission populations (e.g., DV, crew rest, senior officers) will require
greater square feet per person and are not accounted for in equipment UTCs.

• When sites have been selected and established by CE site planning teams, begin
erecting tents/shelters.
• Check on tent/shelter erection teams.
1. Is there adequate manpower within CE and Prime RIBS teams to meet 
erection schedules, or are additional personnel needed?
2. If needed, identify who the augmenting personnel should report to and for 
how long will they be available. Work with CE to train augmenters.
• Designate the shelters by numbering each facility and mark these and unit areas
on a map of the base.
1. CE and fire department should agree on numbering system.
2. Designations will be important for emergency and fire responses.
• Carefully control the locator system and cross reference by individual and
facility number.
• Order or purchase major supplies (e.g., transitioning from sleeping bags to
beds).
• Begin issuing supplies (e.g., cots, cleaning supplies, light bulbs, trash bags,
brooms) and initiate restocking/replacing supplies.
• Locate transient contingency quarters near the contingency quarters tent to
provide for frequent inspections.
1. Consider locating sleeping quarters for contingency quarters operation per-
sonnel either near the contingency quarters operations tent or within the tent.
• Establish work order and a work order tracking systems for CE and
communications support (CS).
• Spot check to ensure that shelters are orderly and the locator system is accurate.
First sergeants/UHRs should be ensuring this already. As necessary, provide
replacement pamphlets for posting procedures, safety, and occupant
responsibilities.
• Work with CE to obtain and locate adequate trash dumpsters within the
contingency quarters community, as well as daily use trash cans at the
contingency quarters tents/shelters. Ensure occupants are emptying daily use trash
cans, if this is not provided for under a service contract.
• Spot check the areas during the first few days for cleanliness (e.g., candy
wrappers and other litter, loose food and drinks, open cups/bottles) and safety
(e.g., extension cords, overused plugs, evidence of smoking materials inside,
careless disposal of smoking materials outside, use of unapproved appliances).
1. Bring unacceptable conditions to the attention of first sergeants/UHRs.
2. Encourage commanders, officers in charge (OIC)/ noncommissioned 
officers in charge (NCOIC), and first sergeants/UHRs to visit their unit’s 
areas if they are beddown somewhere else.
• For higher threat areas, ensure that bunkers or other collective protection
facilities are being provided.
1. Publicize the force protection condition (FPCON) warning systems and 
required responses within the contingency quarters community.

1. Are like type and scheduled crews kept together for crew rest 
reasons?
2. Is aircrew area adequately separated from noise, lighting, 
traffic, and other disruptions that would interfere with crew rest?
• Officers—Determine if there are adequate quarters for senior

separate area, but if clusters/dispersed layouts are used, officers may
be integrated with other personnel.
• SNCOs—Housed similar to officers.
• Females—Is there a stated policy on separation/integration? The
site commander develops the policy on whether there is distinct
separation by area, tent, or partition within shelters. Use of all
female latrines and showers is dictated by numbers and resources,
where specific hours of use may also have to apply.
• Married Personnel—If deployed to the same location, they may be
housed together with site commander approval.
• Transient:
1. Is there a transient population?
2. Are there adequate quarters established for them?
3. Is there the need to support an area for use by transients, who 
must remain together and separated (e.g., special forces units)?
• Other Nation’s Military—If supporting military members from
other nations, do they have different standards and factors or the
number of personnel per tent/shelter?
• DOD Civilians—Housed similar to military forces based on

• Have initial meals, ready to eat (MRE) and unitized group rations
(UGR) rations arrived and are they complete? Are they sufficient based on
known populations and present flow of personnel?
• Are other rations and subsistence on order and in the pipeline? When can
they be expected?
• Are there any existing storage locations available that can be used at the
initial dining facility and/or for centralized control? If not, erect
tents/shelters for centralized storage and daily use/issue.
• Inspect the rations for their condition and conduct a cursory check for
freshness by checking the packaging dates on UGRs. Do not break open
packaged UGRs just to inspect them, if there are no indications of damage
and there is no intention to use them during the beddown surge.
• Move MREs and UGRs off the hot ramp.
1. Place them under shade or within covered storage with adequate cir-
culation to prevent loss to excess heat (or cold).
2. Elevate above ground when necessary for protection from vermin, 
dampness, or extreme temperatures.
3. Work with logistics readiness squadron (LRS) for delivery and 
vehicle transportation requirements for delivery and storage locations.
4. If the temperatures at the location routinely exceed 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit, temperature controls may be required for MREs and 
UGRs.
5. When supply deliveries require infrequent, large bulk delivery, 
meet with CE to obtain environmental control units to control areas for 
the more perishable items.
Subsistence Days of 
Sustainability Calculation
Step 1—Calculate total dollar value of dining facility stocks.
Step 2—Add total dollar value of any war reserve material (WRM) rations
other than MREs.
Step 3—Divide the total by basic daily food allowance (BDFA) or divide
by meal allowance times three.
Step 4—Multiply total cases of MREs by four (three-meals per person, per
day).
Step 5—Add value from step 3 and step 4.
Step 6—Divide by base population.

Operations Planning 
Factors
• Cook to feeding population ratio—1:50.
• Generic Feeding Capacity: Two guests per seat, per hour, multiplied by the
number of meal hours.
EXAMPLE: 100 seating capacity equals 200 per hour, multiplies by
number of meal hours (e.g., 3) equals 600.
• Wartime feeding population—90 percent of time phased force deployment
data (TPFDD) population.
• Patient feeding:
1. 90 percent of patients in medical treatment facilities.
2. 100 percent of convalescent patients.
3. 100 percent of aeromedical staging facility patients.
• Initial feeding platform provides a combination of MREs and UGRs with
food service transition to three hot meals per day by Day 30.
1. Target ration-mix by days:
• Days 1 to 4: Three MREs.
• Days 5 to 14: One MRE and two UGRs supplemented with
A-ration components, if available (fresh fruits and vegetables
[FF&V]).
• Days 15 to 29: UGRs supplemented with A-ration components if
available (FF&V).
• Days 30+: Expand to four meals a day, as required.
• The 463L pallet will be loaded with eight wooden pallets each containing
48-cases of MREs. Each case contains 12-individual meals for a total of 3,456
MRE per UTC or 288 cases. This UTC will feed a population of 1,100 people
two-meals per day for one and one-half days.
• Supplements. Offer supplements based off the monetary difference (within
the respective meal period) from the current BDFA and current calendar year
(CY) Department of Defense (DOD) meal rate prices. 
NOTE: BDFA-CY meal rate meal period = supplement allowance.
• Menu planning and subsistence ordering are based on meal preparations to
serve 100 percent of the base population.
• The minimum day-meal requirements are: one meat entrée, two vegetables,
one starch, one soup, one dessert, and three beverages.
• The size of the DFAC should be based on Air Force Handbook (AFH)
32-1084, Facility Requirements, as well as DFAC storage planning factors.
Calculate requirements based on a population summary (POPSUM).

tial beddown.
2. Be flexible and try to site the facilities with enough space to allow 
picking up and moving kitchen tent components onto the concrete 
surfaces.
3. Do not site the facility originally such that there is no place to move it 
without also having to move a drain field, grease pit, or nearby latrines.
• Conduct a complete inventory of all field kitchen components and
rations/subsistence. Identify any missing or broken critical parts.
• Meet with contracting squadron (CONS) to initiate services contracts for
dining facility personnel services and supply support.
1. Obtain an interpreter at the same time if non-English speaking labor is 
used.
2. If Air Force CONS is not available, check with other armed forces 
contracting officers at the location or nearby—they may have authority to 
help.
3. Check on the ability to obtain services using the government purchase 
card (GPC) card,
4. Check on theater-authorized contract augmentation program (CAP), 
whether Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) or 
Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP).
5. Check on the availability of any theater centralized contract for food 
services support.
• Brief and post the operational feeding plan and any planned major
transitions, such as going from UGRs to regular subsistence, dropping MREs,
adding an additional shift.
• Meet with operations group representatives to finalize requirements for
flight meals based on missions. Determine whether the primary kitchen will
prepare meals or a separate flightline facility will be needed.

Water Usage
• Calculate the expected water usage rates based on planning factors (normally
~50 gallons/day/person, except use ~21.5 gallons/day/person for (arid) areas that
require rationing). The primary planning factor for field kitchens is 3.3
gallons/person/day.
• Further break out the requirements by potable, non-palatable, and non-potable
water.
1. Non-Potable Water:
• Non-potable water is water that has not been examined and declared
safe for human consumption.
• It is generally not used except for dust control around the area site. It
can be used for cleaning equipment that will not touch food products or
food handling equipment.
• Non-palatable water is water that is safe to drink, but is not palatable
(i.e., it tastes bad).
• It can be used in mess kit cleaning stations, kitchen cleaning, and
possibly some steam or hot water tables.
• It may have higher amounts (parts per million) of chlorination, lower
amounts of chlorination if used as hot water, or increased dissolved
solids or gases (above levels for palatability).
• It is usually found when storage bladders have been exposed to higher
heat or when chlorinators or reverse osmosis water purification units
(ROWPU) are not properly adjusted. Use as necessary.
2. Potable Water:
• Potable water is required for consumption and cooking/food
preparation.
• For drinking, approximately 6-liters cooled water per person per day
required in addition to kitchen beverage.
• Requirements for kitchen use are based on an arid environment;
kitchens are planned for 3.3 gallons/person/day (based on a 3-meal day,
but this can vary with the type of rations used).
• Kitchen Cleaning. The amount required is determined by the kitchen
and meals served, but consider 2.35 gallons/per person/per day.
• Kitchen Beverages. 0.5 gallons/day/person as beverage and 0.09
gallons/day/person as ice.
• MREs require 0.06 gallons/meal.
• Meet with CE to discuss water requirements for the kitchens.
1. Determine if there is adequate water production capacity to support 
planned operations.
2. During initial operations, it may be necessary to use rations that require 
less water, if conservation methods are required.
• While CE takes steps to increase water production, get with CONS and medical
to consider the availability of any contract water sources for initial use.
• Coordinate with theater planners to purchase via DOD activity address code
(DODAAC) through Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).

Planning Factors
• The self-help laundry (SHL) system (UTC XFWLS) provides
austere base with self-help laundry capability for up to 550
personnel. Includes 1 small shelter, 10 washers, 20 dryers, and
mobility spares readiness package (MSRP).
• Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) units are locally procured units
for cleaning personal laundry and certain organizational linen.
1. Coordinate with civil engineer (CE) to provide facilities and 
utilities. If possible, equipment maintenance should be included 
in the purchase agreement or through a separate maintenance 
contract.
• Contract linen service can be a full contract service or a partial
contract service that just cleans organizational items, including
medical laundry.
1. When using a partial contract, provide SHL facilities to per-
form personal laundry. Consult with Theater Services Planners 
and the contracting officer to determine available methods (e.g., 
local contract, central theater contract, contractor augmentation 
program).
• It is highly recommended to double the number of SHL systems.
1. While the planning factor is 10 washers and 20 dryers for 550 
personnel, recommend two UTCs or 20 washers and 40 dryers to 
support 550 personnel to reduce customer wait times and build 
residual capacity as washers and dryers become inoperable.
2. Immediately begin sourcing to purchase commercial washers 
and dryers to replace the WRM assets.

• Determine the best mix of contract, organizational, and SHL support that
should be provided.
1. Meet with CE to review setting up on-site laundry requirements for 
each on-site system and for any shelters used by contractors for laundry 
support.
• If palletized or container laundry systems were in the plans,
establish siting and determine when they will be ready (e.g.,
equipment, water, power, drainage, lighting, overhead cover,
shade).
• If systems must be ordered or components purchased to set up
laundries, establish siting and determine when they will be ready.
• Determine the type of water that CE can provide for support.
Potable or non-potable, unless medical determines that some
non-potable water is acceptable.
• Obtain list of CE points of contact (POC) for contact in case of
electrical, water, drainage, or mechanical problems.
2. If self-help laundries are required, determine with linen control 
(LC) if a contractor can provide self-serve units and support.
• Identify methods to obtain repair parts (e.g., logistics support [LS],
contract, reach-back support) and service (e.g., CE, contract).
• Identify where linen (bedding) exchange activities will take place (e.g.,
main lodging office, separate location).
1. Ensure that the area has roadway access and is centrally located 
within the lodging complex.
• Get with medical group (MG) and CE entomology and make provisions
to handle and isolate linens that have been exposed to insect infestations

provide periodic mental health screening for MACP personnel, pre, and
post screening for S&R operations, and screening for any outside agencies
that support the MA program that may come into contact with HR.
• Receive contamination avoidance, hazardous materials handling and
disposal, and blood-borne pathogens training from public health and
bio-environmental offices.
• Establish lines of communication with the medical operations for
Competent medical authority communications for declaration of death and
generation of the DD Form 2064.
• Other operations that play key roles within the MACP program are
security forces, airfield management, contracting, personnel, and public
affairs.
• Air Force contract programs will not be utilized to augment MACP,
S&R, or re-icing mission requirements. Based on unique training,
qualification, and highly sensitive operational support, this is strictly a
Prime Readiness in Base Services (RIBS) team requirement.

Host Nation (HN) 
Support Office
• If primary jurisdiction rules are not established for within the
status-of-forces agreement (SOFA), Prime RIBS members should
work with the HN support office to establish an agreement with the
host nation to grant the USAF primary jurisdiction over US and
coalition nations’ human remains when a death occurs on or off the
installation within that country.
1. This is critically important to preserve evidence of death, pos-
itive means of identification, and to prevent deterioration of re-
mains, ensuring an expeditious return of the fallen to their loved 
ones.
2. Without an agreement, the host nation may reserve the right 
of jurisdiction to the remains, conduct their own autopsy, and 
further delay the return of the fallen to their next-of-kin.

• Even before initiating contact with Army and Air Force Exchange
Service (AAFES) for a barbershop, check on the ability to contract
for primary barber services (e.g., haircuts). Use local hires or
off-duty military.
• Provide for a small shelter with chairs, towels, water source,
interior lighting, and electric, along with several barbershop kits.
Initial Tactical Field 
Exchange Operations 
(TFE)
• Verify the size of the population that will be served and where
located. For large deployments with several distinct contingency
quarters communities, identify which may be primary and satellite
operations.
• Identify sites near contingency quarters and dining facilities that
can support a TFE.
1. Consider using two or more (i.e., separate or combined) small 
shelters or one medium size shelter for primary locations.
2. Determine if International Organization for Shipping (ISO) 
shelters/containers are available for secure storage.
3. Satellite locations may be able to use ISO shelters and 
shipping containers for a TFE and secure stock control.
• Coordinate with the AAFES manager for:
1. Stock.
2. Barber/beautician services.
3. Local vendor support.
4. Name brand concessionaires.
• Establish accounting and cash control.
• Identify to first sergeants’ requirements for labor pool, (e.g.,
injured personnel, who can operate as cashiers or stockers).
• Obtain refrigeration for beverages.
• Establish asset security measures with security forces and civil
engineers.
