DAFMAN 17-1203  13 SEPTEMBER 2022 
27 
2.9.1.1.  An item is in excess when it is no longer required due to mission change, 
equipment upgrades, technology changes, obsolescence, etc.  The item is also considered 
excess when the total quantity on hand exceeds the required quantity, as identified in the 
technical solution/requirements document, plus the number of authorized spares as 
identified in the Acquisition Strategy, and Lifecycle Support Plan (AS/ LCSP). Reference 
AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Lifecycle Management for further information about the 
AS/ LCSP. According to DODI 5000.64_DAFI 23-111, accountable individuals are 
responsible for properly identifying, reporting, and determining correct disposition of 
unserviceable, reparable, or excess property. 
2.9.1.2.  The PC will not permanently retain serviceable excess asset items as mandated by 
SAF/CN guidance. Serviceable excess assets will have a condition code of “C” in DPAS 
and will be redistributed to other units as needed.  Redistribution will be coordinated 
between ECOs. Gaining units will be responsible for shipping costs if location is outside 
the local area.  (T-1).  If assets cannot be redistributed, they will be condition coded as “F, 
G, or H” and turned in to DLADS. For further information on DPAS condition codes, see 
paragraph A2.2.3.9  (T-1). 
2.9.1.3.  The PC will notify the ECO when hardware assets is identified as excess no later 
than 30 calendar days before the equipment goes off-line. This allows completion of the 
screening cycle while the equipment is still in use, eliminating the need to store excess 
assets.  If not possible, until receipt of final disposition instructions, the PC will store the 
equipment to prevent damage, deterioration, or unauthorized cannibalization.  (T-1). 
2.9.1.4.  When an organization receives a replacement IT asset for a technical refresh or 
replaces an unserviceable asset, the ECO will assign the asset being removed with DPAS 
condition code “F, G, or H”, “Ready for turn in”, and then contact the local DLADs facility 
to schedule an appointment for turning in the asset.  (T-1). 
2.9.1.4.1.  The owning PC will coordinate with the ECO, and the Information System 
Security Office (ISSO) or wing Information Assurance (IA), in order to process the 
disposal to   DLADS. (T-1). Once DLADs has received the asset and completed the 
turn in, the ECO will remove the asset  from the APSR within 30 calendar days.  (T-
1). 
2.9.1.4.2.  No further assets of the same type will be purchased by the organization until 
the assets being replaced have been condition coded as “Ready for turn in” and DLADS 
has been contacted to schedule turn in.  (T-1). 
2.9.1.4.3.  If DLADs cannot process an asset turn in within 60 calendar days, the ECO 
will document the scheduled DLADs appointment in the history remarks section for 
the asset in DPAS. 
2.9.1.5.  Dispose of and/or reuse classified media and systems according to the guidance 
in paragraph 2.10.3. 
2.9.1.6.  Per FAR 7.503©(11), ensure that disposal is performed by government personnel 
only, unless a specific authority is given to the contractor to dispose of property at prices 
within specified ranges and subject to reasonable conditions as deemed appropriate by the 
DAF.  (T-0).

2.10.  IT Hardware Assets Disposal. 
2.10.1.  Host bases utilizing a regional DLADS facility may be required to establish a MOA.  
When necessary, the host installation and its regional DLADS facility will formalize a MOA 
to document the processes and procedures for how the installation will interact with DLADS 
for the disposal of IT hardware assets in accordance with DODM 4160.21, Volume 2, Defense 
Materiel Disposition: Property Disposal and Reclamation.  (T-0). 
2.10.2.  Elements of the MOA may be incorporated into the HTSA. 
2.10.3.  Prior to disposal: 
2.10.3.1.  The asset must have met all IT hardware sanitization requirements in accordance 
with AFMAN 17-1301,  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Guidelines for 
Media Sanitization, SP 800-88, Appendix A, and Manual 9-12, Storage Device 
Sanitization and  Destruction Manual.  (T-0). 
2.10.3.2.  All applicable documentation related to the disposal process must be completed 
and signed.  (T-0). 
2.10.3.3.  The disposing organization must plan and budget for disposal costs, to include 
packing and handling materials.  (T-2). 
2.10.4.  DLADS is the primary DOD agent for disposal of all obsolete, or unserviceable 
military property and equipment. Accountable DAF IT hardware will be disposed of through 
the DLADS.  (T-0). 
2.10.4.1.  DLADS guidelines for the disposal of hardware assets can be found at 
https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/.

Chapter 3 
SOFTWARE ASSET MANAGEMENT 
3.1.  Overview and Scope. 
3.1.1.  This chapter provides guidance for physical and financial accountability and 
management of Department of the DAF software. It prescribes detailed processes and assigns 
roles and responsibilities to the key stakeholders that are responsible for procurement, 
management and disposal of software assets.  Additionally, this chapter defines the difference 
between capital and non-capital IUS and prescribes detailed steps to account and financially 
report contractor-developed software and other COTS software that meet capitalization 
criteria. The requirements for this chapter are derived from the following overarching DoD 
policies: SFFAS 10, DODI 5000.76, and DoD FMR, volume 4, chapter 27. 
3.1.2.  Software asset management shall be centralized and managed at the highest level of 
common usage. As the designated Program Manager (PM)/lead for the implementation and 
execution of the DAF ITAM Program, HQ CCC will work with ESLMs, BSLMs, APOs and 
SBAs to centralize and govern software asset management for DAF.  (T-1). The Commander 
(or equivalent) at each installation shall implements licensed COTS or other software for local 
requirements not fulfilled by enterprise software licensing. The management of software 
licenses at the base level does not include those software licenses that are managed through 
enterprise software licensing programs. Software asset management program ensures 
organizations that deploy and manage COTS software track software entitlements and 
implementation information. 
3.1.3.  This chapter excludes guidance for software that is not IUS (non-IUS).  Examples of 
non-IUS software are embedded software (firmware), simulation software, utility programs, 
and software weapon systems and software as a service (SaaS).  Embedded software such as 
software integrated or necessary to operate equipment (e.g., operating system, radar system, 
software internal to the weapons system) will be managed and accounted for as part of the 
equipment in which it is installed. For a comprehensive list of IUS and non-IUS assets, refer 
to Attachment 6. Refer to Figure 3.1 for software guidance organized by software type, 
accounting treatment, and acquisition method definitions and cross-references to governing 
paragraph in this publication.

Figure 3.1.  Software Guidance Breakdown. 
 
3.2.  Software Definition and Types. 
3.2.1.  Software Definition. 
3.2.1.1.  Per Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 10: 
Accounting for Internal Use Software, software includes application and operating system 
programs, procedures, rules, and any associated documentation pertaining to the operation 
of a computer system or program. 
3.2.2.  IUS. 
3.2.2.1.  Is a stand-alone application, or the combined software components of an IT system 
that can consist of multiple applications, modules, or other software components integrated 
and used to fulfill an internal or operational need. 
3.2.2.2.  Is acquired or developed to meet internal or operational needs. 
3.2.2.3.  Is used to operate DAF programs (e.g., financial and administrative software). 
3.2.2.4.  It is used to produce goods and provide services (e.g., maintenance work order 
management). 
3.2.3.  Non-IUS. 
3.2.3.1.  Software that is integrated into and necessary to operate equipment rather than 
perform an application (e.g., an operating system, radar systems, weapons system). To 
further clarify, software embedded within an equipment asset is not solely excluded upon 
classification as such.  For software not to be considered IUS, it must be necessary to 
DAFMAN 17-1203  13 SEPTEMBER 2022 
31 
operate the equipment as intended.  If the equipment could operate as intended upon 
removal of the software, the software is considered IUS.  If the equipment cannot function 
as intended when separated from the software, then the software is not considered IUS and 
any costs for the software must be attributed to the equipment. 
3.2.3.2.  Software developed or acquired to sell to external parties. 
3.2.3.3.  To further determine whether an IT asset is IUS, please refer to Figure 3.2 below.

3.2.4.  Types of Internal Use Software. 
3.2.4.1.  Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software: 
DAFMAN 17-1203  13 SEPTEMBER 2022 
33 
3.2.4.1.1.  COTS  software acquired from a vendor and is ready for use with minimal 
modifications. 
3.2.4.1.2.  Modified COTS  software is pre-existing software that requires further 
development before it is ready for use for its intended function.  Examples include but 
are not limited to creating interfaces with existing systems, configuring software to 
meet end-user requirements, creating new functionality, etc. Modified COTS are COTS 
purchased specifically for modification prior to being placed into service.  If COTS 
software placed into service is going through modification, software enhancement rules 
apply as prescribed in paragraph 3.5.1.5. 
3.2.4.2.  Developed Software: 
3.2.4.2.1.  Contractor-developed  software is software that the DAF paid a contractor 
to design, program, install, and implement including new software and the modification 
of existing or purchased software. 
3.2.4.2.2.  Internally developed  software is software developed and owned by a 
government agency.  Typically, internally developed software is developed by the 
technical staff of the government agency (DAF personnel) for which it is created. 
3.2.4.3.  For additional examples of IUS, please see Attachment 6. 
3.3.  Internal Use Software Financial Criteria. 
3.3.1.  Capital IUS - is recognized as capital if it meets the following criteria: 
3.3.1.1.  It is intended for use by the entity and not intended for sale in the normal course 
of business. 
3.3.1.2.  It has useful life of 2 or more years. 
3.3.1.3.  Full historical cost meets or exceeds $250,000. 
3.3.1.4.  Additional capitalization criteria related to software licenses purchased in bulk 
and enhancements to the existing software is outlined in paragraph 3.5 of this guidance. 
3.3.1.5.  If IUS does not meet the above criteria, please follow processes prescribed in 
paragraph 3.6 of this guidance.

3.5.1.4.5.  The DPAS PA will inform DPAS APO about any changes in the status of 
the IUS asset throughout its lifecycle.  (T-1). 
3.5.1.4.6.  The DPAS PA will maintain all required KSDs and respond to inventory and 
audit requests within 7 calendar days of request, as prescribed in DODI 5000.76.  (T-
0). 
3.5.1.5.  IUS Enhancement Process. 
3.5.1.5.1.  Accountable organization DPAS PA responsible for the IUS asset will 
monitor the asset for potential enhancement activities.  (T-1). 
3.5.1.5.2.  There are two types of software enhancements and only major enhancement 
types will be capitalized by the DAF.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.5.3.  A major IUS enhancement is a modification to existing IUS that provides it 
with significant additional capabilities and enables the software to perform tasks that it 
46 
DAFMAN 17-1203  13 SEPTEMBER 2022 
was previously incapable of performing.  As stated in the Statement of Federal 
Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 10, paragraph 26, major enhancements 
normally require new software specifications and may require a change to all or part of 
the existing software specifications.  Examples of major enhancements could include 
augmenting existing business functions with new features, and/or adding new 
functionality and capability. 
3.5.1.5.4.  DPAS PA will monitor and track all capital enhancements in DPAS that add 
new capabilities based on the following criteria.  (T-1): 
3.5.1.5.4.1.  It is likely the enhancements will result in significant increase in 
capabilities and functionality that is visible to the user; that is, modifications to 
enable the IUS to perform tasks that it was previously incapable of performing. 
3.5.1.5.4.2.  Costs equal to or exceeding the current capitalization threshold ($250K 
or more). 
3.5.1.5.4.3.  The enhancement has an expected service life of 2 years or more. 
3.5.1.5.5.  A minor enhancement is one that has no impact on the overall capability or 
functionality of the system.  The cost of minor enhancements will not be reported in 
DPAS and will be expensed in the period incurred.  (T-0).  Examples of minor 
enhancements include updating data tables, web-enabling, customizing reports, or 
changing graphic user interfaces. Additionally: 
3.5.1.5.5.1.  Software upgrades that are included in annual maintenance and 
security assurance agreements must be expensed, not be capitalized as 
enhancements or separate assets.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.5.5.2.  Costs incurred solely to repair a design flaw or to perform minor 
upgrades that may extend the useful life of the IUS without adding capabilities will 
not be capitalized and must be expensed.  (T-0).  However, the useful life of the 
IUS is subject to adjustment and must reflect the enhancement.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.5.5.3.  Enhancements that extend the useful life of the software without 
adding significant capabilities are to be considered minor enhancements and must 
be expensed.  (T-0). However, in instances where the useful life of the software is 
extended, the amortization period must be adjusted as described.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.5.6.  The purchase of enhanced versions of software that do not meet 
capitalization criteria must be expensed in the period incurred.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.5.7.  If it is determined that enhancement falls under the major enhancement 
category, DPAS PA should perform the same steps that are outlined in paragraph 
3.5.1.5 of this guidance.  (T-1). 
3.5.1.5.8.  Each enhancement will be reported separately with the capital threshold 
applicable to the overall development effort, not each increment.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.5.9.  Any increments following the initial deployment will be accounted for as a 
separate IUS enhancement.  (T-0).

3.5.1.6.  IUS Transfer Process. 
3.5.1.6.1.  When IUS asset ownership changes from one accountable organization to 
another, DPAS PA of the owning organization will initiate the transfer in DPAS 
following the steps outlined in DPAS QRG.  (T-1). 
3.5.1.6.2.  When transferring the asset, DPAS PA will make sure that all documentation 
applicable to the lifecycle of that asset (e.g., acquisition documentation, invoices, etc.) 
is transferred to the gaining organization, whether internal or external to the DAF.  (T-
1). 
3.5.1.6.3.  Full guidance on transfer requirements can be found in the DOD FMR, 
volume 4, chapter 27, section 270203 paragraph G.2. 
3.5.1.7.  IUS Disposal Process. 
3.5.1.7.1.  Accountable organizations must adhere to product licensing agreements 
when transferring, disposing, or reusing commercial IUS in order to avoid potential 
fines or litigation.  (T-0). 
3.5.1.7.2.  Accountable organizations must consult all relevant parties before any IUS 
disposition activity.  (T-2). 
3.5.1.7.3.  Upon disposal, accountable organization DPAS PA will remove the asset 
from DPAS and inform the DPAS APO. (T-1). This will include a statement verifying 
that all media, licenses, and documentation have been destroyed or returned to the 
vendor. (T-1).

IT HARDWARE ENTERPRISE INVENTORY PLAN. 
A4.1.  Purpose and Scope. 
A4.1.1.  The intent of this plan is to articulate the minimum requirements for performing 
asset/item inventories for IT hardware assets.  Additional requirements that may be levied onto 
units by their parent MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU/FOA organization will be articulated in a 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/DRU/FOA-specific Inventory Plan.  (T-1).  Additional guidance may be 
provided by Air Force/A2/6 for SCI and national ISR assets. 
A4.2.  Inventory Frequency. 
A4.2.1.  All Hardware Assets meeting the criteria stated in paragraph 2.4.3 and paragraph 
2.4.4 are accountable and will be inventoried annually. (T-0). 
A4.3.  Preparing for Inventory. 
A4.3.1.  To prepare for an asset inventory, a baseline of the asset account will be produced by 
the ECO and provided to the PC. (T-1). 
A4.3.1.1.  ECO will generate an inventory list in DPAS based on the inventory type 
(Custodian, Cyclic by Custodian, Cyclic by Location, Location, Sensitive, and Custom) 
and provide the report to the responsible PC. (T-1). 
A4.3.2.  To assist in this process, the account owner can use a combination of asset 
discovery/automated inventory tools and manual identification of assets. 
A4.3.2.1.  The account owner can utilize enterprise asset discovery tools to perform a 
network scan to “discover” assets on the network that are within their account. 
A4.3.3.  This discovery cannot be done any earlier than one month prior to the inventory due 
date. (T-1). 
A4.3.4.  One month of scanning will produce a list of assets that have been on the network at 
various times over that scanning period and this list may be included as a component of the 
inventory of a complete account. 
A4.4.  Performing the Inventory. 
A4.4.1.  To perform an asset inventory, the PC will: 
A4.4.2.  Ensure that all assets in their account(s) have been identified. (T-1). 
A4.4.3.  Ensure that gains/losses against the inventory baseline are documented and 
reconciled. (T-1). 
A4.4.4.  If using Automated Inventory Tool (AIT), the physical inventory will be performed 
only on those assets not identified using the AIT.  (T-1). 
A4.4.5.  To inventory remote or teleworking assets, the PC will review documentation (AF 
Form 1297 Hand Receipt or locally established documentation) for assets assigned to remote 
workers and then contact the assigned individual to ensure the asset remains in their possession.  
(T-1).    The individual assigned the asset(s) being inventoried will respond to the PC with a 
DAFMAN 17-1203  13 SEPTEMBER 2022
