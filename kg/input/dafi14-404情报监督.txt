1.  Overview.  This guidance contains 99 tiered compliance statements: 53 (T-0); 34 (T-1); 12 
(T-2).  This publication assigns responsibilities and establishes policy for the effective conduct of 
DAF intelligence activities and intelligence-related activities, and the protection of constitutional 
rights.  All lawful means, and with full consideration of the rights of United States (U.S.) persons, 
shall be used to obtain reliable intelligence information to protect the United States and its interests.  
The DAF has a solemn obligation, and shall continue in the conduct of its activities, to protect 
fully the legal rights of all U.S. persons, including freedoms, civil liberties, and privacy rights 
guaranteed by federal law.  Unit commanders and organization managers with intelligence or 
intelligence related roles play the most important part in this process.

2.3.  Secretary of the Air Force Inspector General (SAF/IG).  The SAF/IG will: 
2.3.1.  Ensure all DAF Questionable Intelligence Activities (QIA) and Significant/Highly 
Sensitive Matters (S/HSM) are properly identified and investigated in accordance with this 
directive and DoDD 5148.13. (T-0)

inspected for compliance with all applicable federal law, executive orders, presidential 
directives, intelligence community directives (ICD), and DoD issuances in accordance with 
DAFI 90-302. Data collected from inspections may be used in official reports as required 
by DAF, DoD, and congress. (T-1) 
2.3.4.  Determine whether any element within their respective jurisdiction is conducting 
intelligence without an assigned mission. (T-0) 
2.3.5.  To assist with determination if a specific activity involves intelligence or 
intelligence-related activities or is research, development, or design for the purpose of 
future intelligence or intelligence-related activities, the following should be considered: 
2.3.5.1.  Permission.  Focuses on the line of authority relied upon for conducting the 
activity.  An activity is likely an intelligence activity if it relies on an intelligence 
authority for permission. 
2.3.5.2.  People.  Is the task performed by an intelligence professional or intelligence 
unit?  Under what authority is the person/unit performing the activity?  This factor 
alone is not determinative, as non-intelligence personnel perform intelligence activities 
if authorized. 
2.3.5.3.  Purpose.  In the military, the purpose of intelligence is typically to provide 
information on “foreign nations, hostile or potentially hostile forces or elements, or 
areas of actual or potential operations” to inform commanders decision making.  Does 
the proposed military action require, for example, collection, processing, and 
integration of this type of information to inform a commander’s decisions about a 
foreign adversary? 
2.3.5.4.  Pipes.  Will the activity result in a product placed on an intelligence 
directorate’s online portal?  Will the information acquired during the activity be entered 
DAFI14-404  23 JANUARY 2025 
5 
into intelligence databases for evaluation, or will the finished product (often a report) 
be entered into intelligence repositories for use by the broader intelligence community 
(IC)?  Does the performance of the activity require access to intelligence databases and 
resources? 
2.3.5.5.  Process.  Examines how information moves from proposal to fruition.  Does 
the activity require knowledge of intelligence sources or methods?  Is it the product of 
an intelligence planning process?  Does the activity require participation of an IC 
element to acquire, process, or analyze data and/or create products? 
2.3.5.6.  Platform.  Is the activity’s required equipment owned or operated by an 
intelligence unit?  If not, will the activity require the use of a non-intelligence platform 
for an intelligence purpose?  For example, the targeting pod on strike aircraft is not an 
intelligence platform, but it is conceivable that it might be used for an intelligence 
purpose. 
2.3.5.7.  Procurement.  This factor considers who paid for any equipment needed for 
the activity.  Was it procured using Military Intelligence Program or National 
Intelligence Program funds? 
2.4.  Secretary of the Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC).  The SAF/GC will: 
2.4.1.  Provide interpretations of intelligence oversight laws and policy for the DAF and

Terms 
Collection—Information is collected when it is received by a Defense Intelligence component, 
whether or not it is retained by the component for intelligence or other purposes.  Collected 
information includes information obtained or acquired by any means, including information that 
is voluntarily provided to the component.  Collected information does not include:  Information 
that only momentarily passes through a computer system of the component; Information on the 
Internet or in an electronic forum or repository outside the component that is simply viewed or 
accessed by a component employee but is not copied, saved, supplemented, or used in some 
manner; Information disseminated by other components or elements of the IC; or Information that 
is maintained on behalf of another U.S. government agency and to which the component does not 
have access for intelligence purposes. 
Counterintelligence—Information gathered, and activities conducted to identify, deceive, exploit, 
disrupt, or protect against espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage or assassinations 
conducted for or on behalf of foreign powers, organizations, or persons, or their agents, or 
international terrorists’ organizations or activities. 
Defense Intelligence Component Head—Senior officials designated by the Secretary of a 
military department for the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence elements of that 
Department. 
Domestic Imagery—A likeness or presentation of any natural or manmade feature or related 
object or activity and the positional data acquired at the same time the likeness or representation 
was acquired, collected in the area that includes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
territories and possessions of the U.S. to a 12 nautical mile seaward limit of the land areas. 
 
Exigent Circumstances—Circumstances when there is a reasonable basis to believe that there is 
imminent danger to a person's life or physical safety or when there are time-critical needs that pose 
significant risks to important U.S. interests. 
Foreign Intelligence—Information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign 
governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations, foreign persons, or international terrorists. 
Imagery—A likeness or presentation of any natural or manmade feature or related object or 
activity and the positional data acquired at the same time the likeness or representation was 
acquired, including products produced by space-based national intelligence reconnaissance 
systems and likenesses or presentations produced by satellites, airborne platforms, unmanned 
DAFI14-404  23 JANUARY 2025 
19 
aerial vehicles, or other similar means.  Imagery does not include ground based or handheld images 
taken by or on behalf of DAF intelligence organizations. 
Intelligence Activities—Refers to all activities that Air Force intelligence components are 
authorized to undertake pursuant to AFPD 14-4. See Joint Pub 1-02. 
Intelligence-Related Activities—Those activities that are not conducted pursuant to E.O. 12333, 
but use intelligence funding (e.g., Military Intelligence Program or National Intelligence Program) 
are rebuttably presumed to be intelligence-related activities. The use of procedures or technology 
similar to intelligence activities to conduct activities that have separate authorities but are not 
intelligence activities under E.O. 12333 does not necessarily convert those separate activities into 
intelligence-related activities. 
The term intelligence-related activity also includes those activities that are not conducted 
pursuant to E.O. 12333, but involve the collection, retention, or analysis of information, and the 
activities' primary purpose is to: Train personnel to perform intelligence duties or activities. 
Conduct research, development, testing, and evaluation for the purpose of developing 
intelligence-specific capabilities; or Conduct intelligence-related sensitive activities, as referred 
to in DoDD 5143.01. See  DoDD 5240.01 
 
Masked—The use of alternate or generic wording in data subject to dissemination that does not 
permit the reader to ascertain the identity of a U.S. person that appeared in an intelligence report. 
Proper Use Memorandum (PUM)—A memorandum signed annually by an organization’s 
certifying government official.  The imagery collecting organization will submit this memorandum 
annually.  It defines their requirements, intended use, and contains a proper use statement that 
acknowledges their awareness of the legal and policy restrictions regarding domestic imagery. 
Publicly Available Information (PAI)—Information that has been published or broadcast for 
public consumption, is available on request to the public, is accessible on-line or otherwise to the 
public, is available to the public by subscription or purchase, could be seen or heard by any casual 
observer, is made available at a meeting open to the public, or is obtained by visiting any place or 
attending any event that is open to the public.  Publicly available information includes information 
generally available to persons in a military community even though the military community is not 
open to the civilian general public. 
Questionable Intelligence Activity (QIA)—Any intelligence or intelligence-related activity that 
may be unlawful or contrary to an executive order, Presidential directive, ICD, or applicable DoD 
policy governing that activity. 
Requesting Entity—An entity of the U.S. government or a state, local, tribal, or territorial 
government that makes a request that is subject to this policy. 
Significant or Highly Sensitive Matters (S/HSM)—An intelligence or intelligence-related 
activity (regardless of whether the intelligence or intelligence-related activity is unlawful or 
contrary to an executive order, presidential directive, ICD, or DoD policy), or serious criminal 
activity by intelligence personnel, that could impugn the reputation or integrity of the IC, or 
otherwise call into question the propriety of intelligence activities.  Such matters might involve 
actual or potential:  congressional inquiries or investigations; adverse media coverage; impact on 
20 
DAFI14-404  23 JANUARY 2025 
foreign relations or foreign partners; or systemic compromise, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of 
protected information. 
U.S. Persons (USP)—Includes:  a U.S. citizen; an alien known by the defense intelligence 
component concerned to be a permanent resident alien; an unincorporated association 
substantially composed of U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens; a corporation incorporated 
in the United States, except for a corporation directed and controlled by a foreign government or 
governments (a corporation or corporate subsidiary incorporated abroad, even if partially or 
wholly owned by a corporation incorporated in the United States, is not a U.S. person).  A person 
or organization in the United States is presumed to be a U.S. person, unless specific information 
to the contrary is obtained.  Conversely, a person or organization outside the United States, or 
whose location is not known to be in the United States, is presumed to be a non-U.S. person, 
unless specific information to the contrary is obtained. 
 
U.S. Person Information (USPI)—Information that is reasonably likely to identify one or more 
specific U.S. persons.  USPI may be either a single item of information or information that, when 
combined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific U.S. 
persons.  Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific 
U.S. persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment by a trained 
intelligence professional.  USPI is not limited to any single category of information or 
technology.  Depending on the context, examples of USPI may include names or unique titles; 
government-associated personal or corporate identification numbers; unique biometric records; 
financial information; and street address, telephone number, and Internet Protocol address 
information.
