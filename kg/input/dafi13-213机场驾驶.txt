This Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive 
(AFPD) 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airfield, Airspace and Range Management. This DAFI applies 
to all civilian employees and uniformed members of the United States Space Force, Regular Air 
Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard organizations (to include contracted locations) 
that administer an airfield driving program. At joint, shared-use, and overseas airfields, this DAFI 
applies to organizations that are operated and/or managed by the Department of the Air Force, as 
outlined in real estate documents or letters of agreement. It establishes responsibilities, procedures, 
and restrictions for the safe control and operation of vehicles and equipment on airfield ramps, 
aprons, taxiways, and runways. Compliance with the Attachments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in this 
instruction is mandatory. Ensure all records generated as a result of processes prescribed in this 
publication adhere to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-322, Records Management and Information 
Governance Program, and are disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule, which is located in the Air Force Records Information Management System. Refer 
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the office of primary responsibility 
(OPR) using the Air Force Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route Air Force 
Form 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. This DAFI may be 
supplemented at any level, however major or field command supplements to include interim 
changes to previously approved supplements must be routed to Headquarters Air Force Flight 
Standards Agency (AFFSA), Director of Airfield Operations (AO) for coordination prior to 
certification and approval. Unit (wing or base) supplements to this DAFI must be routed to the 
responsible major or field command OPR for AO for review and coordination prior to certification 
and approval.  The authorities to waive wing or unit level requirements in this publication are

Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Scope and Purpose. 
1.1.1.  This Department of Air Force (DAF) Instruction provides guidance for developing an 
airfield driving program to provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on 
DAF-owned and/or operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g., 
military, Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, contractors) who, as a part of their job, are 
required to drive on an airfield.  Where applicable, the host wing commander or equivalent 
must ensure guidance outlined in the wing or base supplement to the DAFI addresses any 
unique applicability conditions (e.g., signed Memorandum of Agreement, Memorandum of 
Understanding, support agreement) to ensure compliance and support from non-DAF 
organizations or functions (e.g., other military services, federal or state agencies, host nation, 
contract, commercial companies or offices) that operate vehicles on DAF-owned and/or 
operated airfields.  (T-2).  
1.1.2.  Personnel who operate a vehicle on the airfield need to be knowledgeable of and comply 
with the procedures outlined in this instruction and wing or base supplement. 
1.1.3.  In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft, 
pedestrians, and ground vehicles at DAF airfields that lead to property damage and personnel 
injury. Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this instruction is essential to preventing 
aircraft-vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield. 
1.1.4.  Shared-Use Airfields.  Airfield Management personnel at shared-use airfields (i.e.  Air 
National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) should work with the civil airport manager to develop 
and implement an airfield driving program as applicable. 
1.1.5.  Contingency Locations. Contingency is defined as a situation requiring military 
operations in response to natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed by 
appropriate authority to protect United States interests. At contingency locations, outside the 
United States, the senior airfield authority (SAA) is delegated authority to waive Tier 3 
compliance requirements in this instruction to support tactical or combat operations and 
situations. Authority shall not be further delegated. (T-1). The SAA ensures the following 
actions are accomplish prior to waiver approval: 
1.1.5.1.  Conduct a risk management assessment with the rationale for the waiver and 
explain (1) how complying with the requirement or compliance item impacts mission 
accomplishment, OR (2) cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, 
guidance or manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR (3) expected 
cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply with the 
requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or 
manpower). Note: Waiver may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver 
period or 30 calendar days after the approving commander’s deployment length, whichever 
is shorter. Because waivers are the expression of a specific commander accepting risk, 
approved waivers automatically expire 30 calendar days after a change unless the new 
commander renews the waiver. 
AFI13-213  4 FEBRUARY 2020 
7 
1.1.5.2.  Forward proposed waivers to the Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staff or equivalent 
for an operational review if time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA. 
1.1.5.3.  Refer to Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.4, 
Contingency Airfield Operations (CAO) for additional information.  This AFTTP outlines 
how AFFOR open and operate a deployed or contingency airfield. This AFTTP volume 
also contains planning considerations for airfield management, air traffic control, and 
deployable air traffic control and landing systems (DATCALS) capabilities, procedures, 
forces, and equipment. 
1.2.  Waivers. 
1.2.1.  Units shall use the Air Force Form 679, Air Force Publication Compliance Item Waiver 
Request/Approval to process waivers to this instruction.  (T-1). 
1.2.2.  All waiver requests to this instruction must be reviewed and coordinated on by the Wing 
or Garrison Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM), Airfield Operations Flight 
Commander (AOF/CC) or civilian equivalent, Wing Safety and major or field command OPR 
for AO prior to submission to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. (T-1). 
1.2.3.  Units must include a risk management assessment with the rationale for the waiver and 
explain (1) how complying with the requirement or compliance item impacts mission 
accomplishment, (2) cost of compliance (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or 
manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR (3) expected cost of 
compliance outweighs the benefit; OR (4) personnel cannot comply with the requirement due 
to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). (T-1).  If 
deemed necessary, submit additional data (e.g., letters of procedure, airspace maps, traffic 
patterns, airfield diagrams) to substantiate the waiver request. Note: Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers 
may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 90 calendar days 
after the approving commander’s tour length, whichever is shorter. Because waivers are the 
expression of a specific commander accepting risk, approved waivers automatically expire 90 
calendar days after a change unless the new commander renews the waiver. 
1.2.4.  Units must provide an informational copy of all Tier 3 approved waivers to major or 
field command OPR for AO.  (T-2). 
1.2.5.  The requesting office unit commander must forward a copy of the approved waiver 
(e.g., AF Form 679 or equivalent) to the Air Force Flight Standards, Airfield Operations 
Directorate (AFFSA/XA) workflow at hqaffsa.xa@us.af.mil within 30 calendar days of 
approval for situational awareness and process improvement considerations. (T-1). 
1.2.6.  Approved waivers become part of the approver’s and requestor’s official records and 
are appropriately filed in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-322. (T-1).

RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES 
5.1.  General. 
5.1.1.  Radio communications are a critical link in the Air Traffic Control system.  The single, 
most important thought in communications with the Air Traffic Control Tower is 
understanding.  It is essential to acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by 
using the appropriate call sign. 
5.1.2.  Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions are kept as brief as possible.  
However, controllers need to know what you want to do before they can properly carry out 
their control duties.  The vehicle operator should know and understand what the controller 
wants them to do. 
5.1.3.  Proper radio communications phraseology, discipline, and techniques. The words 
"clear" or “clearance” must not be used in communication with air traffic control tower. (T-1). 
Exception: Vehicle operators may reply “Loud and Clear” in response to an air traffic control 
tower request for radio transmission quality or clarity. 
5.1.4.  Vehicle operators must be vigilant and monitor air traffic control radio communications 
frequencies on the airfield for situational awareness, especially when operating on an active 
runway.  (T-1). 
5.2.  Radio Techniques. 
5.2.1.  Listen before transmitting. Be cognizant of other radio transmissions, multiple 
transmitters may override and/or block out other receiver messages. 
5.2.2.  Think before keying the transmitter; know exactly what you need to say before you say 
it. 
5.2.3.  Hold the microphone close to your lips and, after pressing the “microphone button,” a 
slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.  Speak in a 
normal, conversational tone. 
5.2.4.  When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again.  The 
controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or 
scanning the runway to enable your request. 
5.2.5.  Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver.  Check your volume and 
frequency to make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit position.  Frequency 
blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to unintentional transmitter 
operation.  This type of interference is commonly referred to as a “stuck mike,” and controllers 
may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the problem. 
5.2.6.  Ensure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the 
ground station equipment.  Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind spots. 
5.2.7.  Use caution when using a vehicle mounted and/or handheld radio and operating a 
vehicle at the same time. When possible, use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked. 
AFI13-213  4 FEBRUARY 2020 
35 
5.3.  Phraseology.  Vehicle operators must contact the Air Traffic Control Tower controller every 
time they proceed onto or leave the CMA.  (T-1).  When proceeding onto a CMA, advise the 
controller of three things:  WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are.  
Always acknowledge all communications so ground control and other persons know that the 
message was received.  Always give aircraft and Air Traffic Control transmissions priority unless 
an emergency exists.  Very High Frequency and Ultra High Frequency transmissions are reserved 
for the primary use of aircraft and Air Traffic Control Tower personnel.  A typical runway crossing 
transmission sequence is as follows: 
Table 5.1.  Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology. 
VEHICLE OPERATOR: 
“JACKSONVILLE TOWER, AIRFIELD 
ONE.” 
Air Traffic Control Tower: 
“AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE TOWER.” 
VEHICLE OPERATOR: 
“JACKSONVILLE TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE 
REQUEST TO CROSS (runway) AT 
point/intersection). 
Air Traffic Control Tower: 
“AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway) AT 
(point/intersection).  or “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD 
SHORT OF (runway).” 
5.3.1.  Vehicle operators must read back Air Traffic Control Tower instructions verbatim.  (T-
1). If you are unsure of what the controller has transmitted, or if you do not understand an 
instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat the instructions (or say again) before taking 
any action.  (T-1). Good communication only occurs when each party knows and understands 
what the other is saying. 
Table 5.2.  Sample Read back Instructions. 
VEHICLE OPERATOR: 
Note:  Airfield 1 visually scans 
the runway prior to entry, and then 
proceeds across the runway 
“AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS APPROVED TO 
CROSS (runway) AT (point/intersection).  WILL 
REPORT WHEN OFF.” Or “AIRFIELD ONE, 
HOLDING SHORT (at location).” 
VEHICLE OPERATOR: 
“JACKSONVILLE TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING 
COMPLETE, OFF (runway) AT (location).” 
Air Traffic Control Tower: 
“AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.” 
5.3.2.  If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they must provide a read back to 
the Air Traffic Control Tower.  (T-3).  See example below. 
36 
AFI13-213  4 FEBRUARY 2020 
Table 5.3.  Sample Hold Short Instructions. 
Air Traffic Control Tower: 
“AIRFIELD ONE PROCEED VIA TAXIWAY CHARLIE, 
HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO SEVEN.” 
or 
“AIRFIELD ONE PROCEED VIA CHARLIE, HOLD 
SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO SEVEN.” 
VEHICLE OPERATOR: 
“AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.” 
Air Traffic Control Tower: 
“AIRFIELD ONE, READ BACK HOLD 
INSTRUCTIONS.” 
VEHICLE OPERATOR: 
“AIRFIELD ONE, PROCEEDING VIA CHARLIE, WILL 
HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO SEVEN.” 
5.4.  Common Use Phrases.  Table 5.4. provides the meaning of commonly used radio 
phraseology.

inside the runway hold position marking. (e.g., holdline) on paved taxiways or ramps and the 
designated runway safety area. 
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of the 
ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment. 
Restricted Area—An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring 
security protection level. Marked with signs prior to entering, Red Lines indicate the boundaries. 
Risk Management Assessment—A decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible 
courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best courses of action for any given 
situation. 
Runway—A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of 
aircraft. 
Runway Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment. Found 
at the point a taxiway/runway intersect and runway/runway intersect. 
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an 
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take- 
off of aircraft. Runway incursions have the potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of 
life. While there are several factors involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these 
incidents result from failure to follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss 
of situational awareness. These are further classified into three operational categories: 
Operational Error—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of separation. 
Pilot Deviation—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of air traffic control instructions, 
DAF instructions, DAF manuals or Federal Aviation regulations. 
Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation—Any entry or movement on the CMA by a vehicle (including 
aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been authorized by air traffic control. 
Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group (RIPWG)—This group provides a forum for 
analyzing and discussing each runway incursion to determine corrective actions and strategies to 
prevent future occurrences. 
Spot Check—A spot check is conducted randomly for the purpose of enforcement and compliance 
with airfield driving procedures. Spot checks include but are not limited to the accuracy and 
currency of the driver’s Air Force Form 483 and the availability and currency of the local airfield 
diagram, Department of the Air Force Visual Aids (e.g., DAFVA 11-240, DAFVA 13-222). 
Taxilane—Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from 
parking spots and taxiways. 
44 
AFI13-213  4 FEBRUARY 2020

A2.1.  Program Objectives.  The main objective of a RIPWG is to analyze each runway incursion 
and corrective actions taken in an effort to prevent future occurrences. 
A2.2.  Program Scope.  A RIPWG is used to evaluate the airfield driving operating procedures 
and/or standards and airfield configuration (to include signs, marking, lighting) to determine if 
corrective actions are needed. The RIPWG functional experts assess all pertinent areas that are a 
part of, or affect, the negative trend or unsafe condition. 
A2.3.  Attendees.  The RIPWG includes Operations Support Squadron Commander, AOF/CC, 
AFM, wing or garrison ADPM, tower chief controller, wing safety, unit commanders, unit ADPMs 
and other organizational leadership as determined locally. 
A2.4.  RIPWG.  The RIPWG will: 
A2.4.1.  Develop strategies to prevent the reoccurrence of runway incursions. (T-3). Examples 
include but are not limited to: 
A2.4.1.1.  Increase or improve local training or testing materials. 
A2.4.1.2.  Implement mandatory briefings to all airfield drivers, aircrew and air traffic 
control personnel, as applicable. 
A2.4.1.3.  Limit runway crossings or limit crossings to certain taxiways and/or road 
intersections. 
A2.4.1.4.  Increase penalty for controlled movement area violations. 
A2.4.1.5.  Alter the shape or increase the size of the controlled movement area. 
A2.4.2.  Determine if additional signage, markings, and lighting are needed in high-risk areas. 
(T-3). Note: Coordinate with major or field command OPR for AO prior to implementing new 
procedures or purchasing airfield support systems such as signs, marking and lighting. 
Examples of additional signs, markings, and lighting projects include the following: 
A2.4.2.1.  Installing “Stop, Do Not Enter, Contact Air Traffic Control Tower” signs and 
markings at runway hold lines and roads leading to the runway. 
A2.4.2.2.  Increasing visibility of runway hold position markings by increasing the width 
of the yellow stripes from six to 12 inches. Note: This option requires coordination with 
civil engineer and wing safety and a work order request to change is implemented 
uniformly over the entire airfield. 
A2.4.2.3.  Painting runway hold position signs on pavement prior to the runway hold 
position markings. (See Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 150/5340-1, 
Standards for Airport Markings). Note: This option requires coordination with civil 
engineer and wing safety and a work order request to change is implemented uniformly 
over the entire airfield.
