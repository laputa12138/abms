SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Major changes 
include renaming the publication title from “Air Force Nuclear Enterprise” to “Air Force Nuclear 
Mission,” moving Air Force nuclear mission roles and responsibilities, governing bodies, and 
key functions to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 13-500, Air Force Nuclear Mission Responsibilities, 
and correcting Headquarters Air Force (HAF) organizational names. 
1.  Background. 
1.1.  Air Force Nuclear Operations  .  Nuclear operations are that portion of the range of 
military operations pertaining to nuclear weapons and include deterrence, crisis response, 
strike, assessment, and return to stability.  Air Force nuclear operations comprise weapons, 
weapon delivery systems, and forces that conduct nuclear command and control; operate, 
sustain, maintain, and secure nuclear weapons; provide nuclear weapons surety across the 
stockpile-to-target sequence; and support the Air Force nuclear mission as a whole. 
1.2.  Air Force Nuclear Mission.  The Air Force nuclear mission consists of the people, 
organizations, processes, procedures, and systems conducting, executing, and supporting 
nuclear operations, and developing and implementing nuclear policy and guidance.  
Reference AFI 13-500 for a description of the major deliberative bodies of the Air Force 
Nuclear Governance Structure and a description of key nuclear mission functions. 
2.  Air Force Nuclear Mission Policy.  At the Service level, the Air Force organizes, trains, and 
equips nuclear forces for day-to-day capabilities to support combatant commander requirements.  
At the national level, Air Force nuclear operations support national security goals of deterring 
adversaries from attacking the U.S. and its interests with nuclear weapons, other weapons of 
mass destruction, and large-scale forces; promoting non-proliferation efforts; assuring allies and 
partners of our capability to protect them; and defeating adversaries.  It is Air Force policy that 
the Service: 
2.1.  Presents forces to combatant commanders to deter adversaries, assure allies and 
partners, extend deterrence on behalf of allies and partners, and conduct nuclear operations. 
2.2.  Organizes, trains, and equips those personnel, weapons systems (i.e., intercontinental 
ballistic missiles; dual capable long-range bombers; dual capable fighters; tankers; and 
nuclear command control and communications), support forces (e.g., space, missile warning, 
and communications systems; and airlift, reconnaissance/surveillance, and command and 
control assets), and support infrastructure (e.g., wing command posts and mobile support 
teams) required to conduct robust, reliable, flexible, and survivable nuclear operations in 
support of U.S. national security objectives and U.S. Government international agreements. 
AFPD13-5  17 JULY 2018

2.3.  Develops and implements nuclear weapons surety policies, procedures, controls, and 
actions to contribute to the reliability and safety of nuclear weapons and ensure the absence 
of nuclear weapon accidents, incidents, unauthorized detonations, or degradation of weapon 
effectiveness during the stockpile-to-target sequence of the nuclear weapon. 
2.4.  Promotes a culture of accountability, self-assessment, and uncompromising 
performance.  Within the context of the nuclear mission, accountability is the 
acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for nuclear-related actions, decisions, and 
policies and includes authority, administration, and implementation.  Accountability 
encompasses the obligation to report to appropriate authorities any incidents that are 
inconsistent with existing Air Force policies and instructions including, but not limited to, 
AFI 1-1, Air Force Standards. 
2.5.  Advocates for the necessary investments and resources to sustain, modernize, and 
recapitalize nuclear forces and supporting infrastructure. 
2.6.  Provides oversight of, and reports on the safety, security, reliability, effectiveness, and 
credibility of the nuclear mission through periodic, comprehensive Nuclear Mission 
Assessments. 
3.  Roles and Responsibilities.  Refer to AFI 13-500 for Air Force nuclear mission roles and 
responsibilities specific to applicable organizations.
