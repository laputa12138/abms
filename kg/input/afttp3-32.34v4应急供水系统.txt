INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. General Information. The Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) 
Water System, provides potable water and wastewater recovery at contingency 
locations, provided there is a source of potable water or water that can be made 
potable. The water system provides water to support base facilities and recovers 
the wastewater for appropriate disposal. The water system is modular in design 
and scalable to meet a variety of user deployment needs. It can draw raw water 
from a natural source (i.e., pond, lake, stream, sea, or ocean) and then purify, store, 
and distribute the potable water while maintaining sufficient pressure, quantity, 
and quality for an entire base. The selected modular configuration determines the 
amount of potable water the system will produce per day. With the appropriate 
adapters, the system can also draw and distribute water from other potable water 
sources.  
 
1.2. System Overview. The BEAR water system consists of five subsystems: (1) 
Source Run Subsystem, (2) Water Production Subsystem with Reverse Osmosis 
Water Purification Units, (3) 550-Initial Subsystem, (4) 550-Follow-On 
Subsystem, and (5) the Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem 
(Figure 1.1). 
 
1.2.1. The system is semi-automatic in that the 3,000-gallon facility storage tanks 
will fill automatically if operators maintain the manually filled 20,000-gallon 
storage tanks at the appropriate level. After filling the system to full capacity, 
water should be available for 5 days given 30 gallons per person per day usage. 
The removal of facility wastewater is also automatic under normal circumstances 
and does not require manual intervention. 
 
1.2.2. The water system has a series of color-coded piping, pumping, fluid control, 
and water storage components that comprise five distinct subsystems. Figure 1.2 
lists color assignment for subsystem components.

1.3. Technical Resources and Information. Refer to Technical Order 40W4-21-
1-WA-1, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Water System PN 
3000001, for detailed information on the BEAR water system. It addresses 
information such as unpacking, preparation for use, safety, assembly, and 
operation and maintenance instructions. Further information on the installation 
and operation of the BEAR water system is available in the Basic Expeditionary 
Airfield Resources (BEAR) Water System Course on the myLearning system at 
https://lms-jets.cce.af.mil/moodle/. In addition, contact the Air Force Civil 
Engineer Center Reach-Back Center when looking for information not found in 
the references in Attachment 1. Contact the Reach-Back Center at 1-888-232-

1.4. Environmental Considerations. Safe food and water, and proper disposal 
of waste is essential. The intention of environmental goals during contingencies 
is to minimize risks to human health and safety and prevent unnecessary damage 
to the environment while maximizing the natural resources available to support 
readiness and operational effectiveness. Further information on integrating 
environmentally responsible practices during contingency operations is available 
in Department of Defense Instruction 4715.22, Environmental Management 
Policy for Contingency Locations and Air Force Handbook 10-222V4, 
Environmental Considerations for Overseas Contingency Operations. 
 
1.5. General Safety Practices. Every job or operation has its own safety hazards, 
and everyone involved should adhere to proper safety practices to prevent injury 
or illness. This is especially critical during force beddown at austere locations and 
base recovery activities. Exposure to construction, heavy equipment, power 
production equipment, fuel systems, mechanical systems, and water or 
wastewater systems create an assortment of job-related hazards. Be alert for water 
system hazards such as highly pressurized subsystems and components, 
flammable fuels, hazardous chemicals, and infectious black and gray water 
products from wastewater systems. Also guard against electrical, fire, tripping, 
and falling hazards. Remain vigilant to stay safe. Note: As used in this 
publication, black water refers to latrine wastewater containing human waste. 
Gray water refers to wastewater from non-latrine sources such as showers, 
laundries, kitchen operations, and handwashing devices. 
 
1.5.1. Personnel should wear the appropriate protective clothing and equipment 
for the hazard present. Department of the Air Force Manual 91-203, Air Force 
Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Standards, lists personal protective 
equipment for selected Civil Engineer activities. Workers have the ultimate 
responsibility to properly use, inspect, and care for individual protective 
equipment assigned to them. 
 
1.5.2. When lethal voltages are involved, workers should adhere to Air Force 
Manual 32-1065, Grounding & Electrical Systems. Personal protective equipment 
that provides appropriate arc flash protection is required for all personnel working 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023

on or near exposed energized electrical equipment operating at 50 volts or more. 
See Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-560-01, Electrical Safety, O&M, and 
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety 
in the Workplace, to identify tasks that require Arc Flash personal protective 
equipment.

BASIC PREPARATIONS AND SITE LAYOUT 
 
2.1. General Information. How CE teams setup, operate, and maintain 
contingency water systems vary by location and depend a great deal on the terrain 
features, water source, and the type and quantity of users. Since potential locations 
or sites may not need every available contingency water subsystem, the modular 
design of the BEAR water system allows planners to select specific subsystems 
based on the needs at the contingency location. However, to address overall 
system installation and operational concepts, here we describe all subsystems as 
interconnected, not stand-alone. Further, we used the Source Run Subsystem 
option for raw water collection and the Water Production Subsystem option for 
water production to illustrate collection and production capabilities. 
 
2.2. Basic Preparations. A key factor to consider when preparing for contingency 
water operations is the establishment of access to an adequate water source to 
sustain operations, usually a municipal water supply or nearby raw water source. 
In addition, consider the site location, size of the base supported, and requirements 
for prepositioning equipment. Try to provide adequately detailed plans so a work 
crew can off-load selected subsystems at designated locations and assemble them 
in minimum time. Consider taking full advantage of Installation Geospatial 
Information and Services satellite imagery, global positioning system information 
and common installation picture databases, when making site preparations. The 
Air Force GeoBase system provides good resources for beddown planning of 
water systems in relation to site layout, terrain, and available water sources. 
Access the Air Force GeoBase system easily and securely through the Air Force 
Portal using the link in Attachment 2. For additional information on contingency 
water operations beyond those addressed here, refer to Air Force Pamphlet 10-
219, Volume 6, Planning and Design of Expeditionary Airbases. 
 
2.3. Site Layout. Wherever the base is located, there should be adequate real 
estate outside of the camp placement area to allow for the Water Operations Area. 
The Water Operations Area is an area identified for the Dual Water Pump Station, 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
15 
 
Water Tank Farm, and Water Production subsystems (Figure 2.1). Site the Water 
Operations Area on terrain that is relatively flat and free of debris. Table 2.1 
provides Water Operations Area dimensions and the quantity of water production 
subsystems relative to the base or camp population. Figure 2.2 shows a typical 
location for a Water Operations Area in relation to the camp facilities layout area. 
Note: Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit components not displayed.

2.4. Equipment Preparation. Consider prepositioning equipment that is ready 
for installation in those areas where work crews will use the equipment. 
Preplanning should have included drop-off points, the establishment of temporary 
roads to the sites, and use off-loading equipment, such as forklifts and cranes 
(Figure 2.3). When the equipment arrives, work crews should unpack, inspect, 
and inventory equipment to verify required components and parts are on hand. 
Each subsystem contains all the parts listed in the technical order inventory, 
including extra parts left over after subsystem assembly. The extra parts are 
intentional to provide system flexibility and a source for replacement parts. 
Attachment 3 illustrates common components for subsystems. Though addressed 
in the technical order, cold weather kits for these subsystems are currently under 
development and are not included. During inventory, personnel should quickly 
repair or replace unserviceable or missing equipment. Additionally, make sure to 
retain and store all serviceable packing material and shipping containers for reuse.

2.5. System Flexibility. Work crews have the flexibility to configure the water 
system to meet the specific deployment needs of the unit; the planned or final 
installation at your base may not look exactly as depicted in this handbook. 
Regardless, the diagrams and illustrations presented in this publication are still 
applicable and can provide sufficient guidance to accomplish installation tasks 
even if a different configuration of equipment is required. Keep in mind the 
plumbing illustrations provided here depict basic subsystem plumbing using a 
typical layout and a standard water production subsystem. Users should refer to 
Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1 for detailed configuration procedures. 
 
2.6. Subsystems Interface. The interface to various subsystem components is 
normally accomplished using suction or discharge hoses with quick disconnect 
fittings. Connect these quick disconnect fittings using procedures in Attachment 
4. In some instances, engineers may need to convert to Polyvinyl Chloride pipe 
connections in unusual areas where it is necessary to bury water distribution 
plumbing to prevent damage. Refer to Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1 if it 
becomes necessary to use Polyvinyl Chloride pipe connections or to fabricate 
other threaded or non-threaded connections.

SOURCE RUN SUBSYSTEM 
 
3.1. General Information. The Source Run Subsystem provides raw water input 
(source water) for the contingency water system. It can pull water from a raw 
water source (i.e., river, lake, sea, or ocean) up to 100 feet away and 20 feet below 
the pumping station. The system can pump the source water a distance of 6000 
feet and a height of 150 feet to a raw water storage tank. 
 
3.2. Components. Illustrated in Figure 3.1 and described in Table 3.1 are the 
major components that make up the Source Run Subsystem. However, for a 
complete list of all subsystem components, including nomenclature and quantities 
per subsystem, refer to Table 3.2 in this handbook and the Source Run Subsystem 
Illustrated Parts Breakdown in Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1.

3.3.1. Position 400-Gallons per Minute Pump and Assemble Strainer and Float 
Buoy. Position the 400-gallons per minute diesel pump and assemble the Source 
Run Subsystem strainer, float buoy, hoses, and associated components according 
to the following procedures and accompanying illustrations. 
 
3.3.1.1. Position the trailer-mounted 400-gallons per minute pump assembly 
(Figure 3.2) within 100 feet of the raw water source. Then, set the trailer parking 
brake and chock the wheels to prevent the trailer from moving. Afterward, level 
the trailer and lower the stabilizer jacks.

3.3.1.2. Inflate the buoy with the hand pump while being careful to avoid sharp 
objects or similar items that could damage the buoy. Then, connect the wire rope 
to the strainer and float buoy. Configure the wire to keep the strainer submerged 
at least four feet, when the strainer and buoy deploys. If possible, confirm the 
strainer is also at least four feet from the bottom of the raw water source to avoid 
sand or silt from entering the system. It may also be necessary to anchor the 
strainer and float buoy due to constant wave motion (Figure 3.3). 
 
Figure 3.3. Positioning Float Buoy, Strainer, and Anchor. 
 
 
 
 
CAUTION 
When inflating the float buoy, it will become bulky and possibly 
hard to handle. Use care to prevent buoy from contacting sharp 
objects, which may cause damage to the buoy. 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023

3.3.1.3. Using Figure 3.4 as a guide, connect enough Source Run Subsystem 4-
inch suction hoses (2, 3, and/or 4) to the strainer and float buoy assembly to reach 
the 400-gallons per minute pump (5). Afterward, connect the assembled hose to 
the inlet of the pump. Ensure the hose is long enough to deploy the strainer and 
float buoy at least 25 feet from the shoreline. When determining the amount of 
hose length needed, consider the differences in shoreline location due to tide 
changes. Note: Always ensure hose couplings have neoprene gaskets properly 
installed before connecting hose assemblies.

3.3.2.2. Now, move to the Water Operations Area and complete the following 
actions. Position the 20,000-gallon Source Run Subsystem tank (15) at the edge 
of the Water Operations Area as depicted in Figure 3.6. Then install the tank’s 
vent, drain hose, and ball valve (16, 17), 4-inch inlet elbow (female-to-female), 
and outlet elbow (female-to-male) onto the tank (Figure 3.7). Next, attach a 4-
inch x 15-foot suction hose (4) to each quick disconnect elbow. Afterward, 
connect 4-inch ball valve assemblies (14), pipe tee assemblies (13), and 15-foot 
suction hoses (4) as illustrated in Figure 3.5. Note: The 20,000-gallon raw water 
tank in the Source Run Subsystem will be interconnected and parallel to one or 
more Water Production Subsystem 20,000-gallon raw water tanks spaced 6 feet 
apart. Make sure the inlet and outlet 4-inch tee branch assemblies are facing 
toward the 20,000-gallon tank accepting these connections.

Figure 3.7. 20,000-Gallon Raw Water Tank. 
 
 
 
3.3.2.3. Complete the Source Run Subsystem installation at the 400-gallons per 
minute pump as follows. Starting at the reducer assembly on the outlet side of the 
400-gallons per minute pump (Figure 3.8), connect enough 6-inch x 150-foot raw 
water discharge hoses (8) until you are within 175 feet of the swing check valve 
(6) closest to the Source Run Subsystem raw water tank. Then, attach a 6-inch x 
50-foot hose assembly (9). Note: If flaking boxes (Figure 3.9) are used to deploy 
6-inch raw water hoses, follow the procedures in Technical Order 40W4-21-1-
WA-1, Work Package (WP) 004 00. Deployment of hoses from flaking boxes 
requires at least three people: one to drive the truck and two to remove the hoses 
from the flaking boxes. One of the two, walking behind the truck, should also act 
as supervisor of the operation. 
 
3.3.2.4. Next, install a 6-inch x 4-inch reducer (10) to the hose, then attach two 4-
inch x 50-foot hoses (11), followed by a 4-inch x 25-foot hose (12). To finish, 
connect the hose to the swing check valve. 
 
3.3.2.5. If the subsystem plumbing crosses roadways or similar heavy vehicular 
traffic areas, use the hose bridge system to provide hose rollover protection. 
Assemble the hose bridge system according to Attachment 5. This completes basic 
installation of the Source Run Subsystem.

3.4. Operation. The following procedures address basic steps to operate the 
Source Run Subsystem. For detailed procedures, including pump engine prestart 
checks and start-up procedures, see Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1. 
 
3.4.1. Open the inlet and outlet 4-inch ball valves on the 20,000-gallon Source 
Run Subsystem raw water tank (and 20,000-gallon Water Production Subsystem 
tank if interconnected). Close the 2-inch ball valve on the tank drain, and then 
open the 4-inch ball valves on the pipe tee assemblies. See Figure 3.5 on page 24 
for typical Source Run Subsystem ball valve locations. 
 
3.4.2. Ensure all hose assemblies (and pipes if transition kit installed), valves, and 
fittings on the 400-gallons per minute Diesel Pump are properly connected and 
tight. Check the strainer and float buoy for proper connection. Note: Always 
ensure hose couplings have neoprene gaskets properly installed before connecting 
hose assemblies. 
 
3.4.3. Start the pump engine according to start-up procedures for existing 
environmental conditions (i.e. cold/warm weather) and allow the engine to warm 
up for approximately five minutes. Once the engine has warmed up, adjust the 
engine speed to recommended normal run speed, and apply load. 
 
3.4.4. Ensure water is properly flowing from the pump to the Source Run 
Subsystem raw water tank and Water Production Subsystem raw water tank (if 
interconnected). 
 
3.4.5. Once the pump is operating, shut the pump down when the raw water tanks 
are full; when service or maintenance is required; or when the pump is likely to 
experience a dead head condition for more than a brief period. 
 
3.4.6. Be sure to periodically recheck all hoses, connections, pipes, valves, 
fittings, and 20,000-gallon raw water tank(s) for leaks. Make needed repairs and 
perform maintenance according to procedures in applicable technical orders and 
manuals. Note: Contingency water systems tend to leak a little, so small leaks are 
usually unavoidable and should not be a major cause of concern.

WATER PRODUCTION SUBSYSTEM 
 
4.1. General Information. The Water Production Subsystem generates potable 
water for distribution to user facilities within the contingency water system. 
Operators perform water purification using the 1500 Reverse Osmosis Water 
Purification Unit (Figure 4.1), usually set up in a parallel configuration. Raw 
water input for the Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit pumps first into 
20,000-gallon storage tanks then goes to the Reverse Osmosis Water Purification 
Units through a series of hoses and fittings. The potable water generated by the 
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units runs through another series of hoses 
and fittings to 20,000-gallon potable water storage tanks. Note: Reverse Osmosis 
Water Purification Units contain additional hoses and electrical pumps (not 
addressed in this handbook) for connecting onto the rest of water system. 
 
Figure 4.1. 1500 Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit. 
 
 
 
4.1.1. By-products from the water purification process include both wastewater 
and reject water (also known as brine or concentrate). Wastewater and reject water 
(hereafter referred to as brine for clarity) routes or distributes separately. 
Wastewater goes to a 3,000-gallon wastewater tank. Brine goes to a 20,000-gallon 
brine storage tank and a Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit backwash tank. 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
33 
 
 
4.1.2. The configuration of the brine tank and hoses allow reuse of brine output 
for controlling dust, construction purposes, improving electrical grounds, 
decontamination, and various other purposes. Units should not use brine output 
for washing aircraft and vehicles if it has a high salt content. Although personnel 
can use brine output for firefighting, units should not use it in their fire trucks. If 
not reusing brine output, it, along with Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit 
wastewater goes to waste disposal via a 35-gallons per minute electric pump (or 
backup 125-gallons per minute diesel pump). Note: Units should not use brine 
output for any purpose if suspected hazardous chemicals are present in the source 
water until tested for presence of said suspected chemicals. 
 
4.2. Components. Described in Table 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4.2 are the 
major components of the Water Production Subsystem. However, for a complete 
list of all subsystem components, including nomenclature and quantity per 
subsystem, refer to Table 4.2 in this handbook and the Water Production 
Subsystem Illustrated Parts Breakdown in Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1.

Osmosis Water Purification Units. 
 
 
 
4.3. Installation. Installation of the Water Production Subsystem is essentially 
the same regardless of the type of Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit used. 
There are two or three purification units in a Water Production Subsystem basic 
configuration, but if adding more Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units, the 
configuration and number of components will obviously change. Using more 
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units or even interconnecting different types 
of Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units is optional, so our discussion here 
will only address basic installation of a three-Reverse Osmosis Water Purification 
Unit Water Production Subsystem. Before installing the Water Production 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023

Subsystem, review the planned dimensions of the Water Operations Area (see 
Table 2.1) and placement of the Water Production Subsystem 20,000-gallon raw 
water tank (Figure 4.3). Then, refer to component layout diagrams in this chapter 
and the list in Table 4.2 to identify each numbered component when performing 
the steps below. Note: Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units contain 
additional hoses and electrical pumps (not addressed in this handbook) for 
connecting onto the rest of water system.

4.3.1. Position Water Tanks, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units, and 35-
Gallons per Minute Pump. Position water tanks, Reverse Osmosis Water 
Purification Units, and 35-gallons per minute pump as follows: 
 
4.3.1.1. Position the Water Production Subsystem 20,000-gallon raw water tank 
at the edge of the Water Operations Area and alongside the Source Run Subsystem 
tank. Position tanks six feet apart and ensure the vent and drain assembly is on the 
tanks. Link the tanks together by connecting the 4-inch x 15-foot suction hoses 
from the Water Production Subsystem tank to the inlet and outlet branch 
assemblies on the Source Run Subsystem tank as illustrated in Figure 4.4. Note: 
Always ensure hose couplings have neoprene gaskets properly installed before 
connecting hose assemblies. 
 
4.3.1.2. Before positioning Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units verify that 
a 120-Volt Alternating Current, 1-phase, 60-Hertz and a 208-Volt Alternating 
Current, 3-phase, 60-Hertz power source is available. Then, position Reverse 
Osmosis Water Purification Units approximately 20 feet from the Water 
Production Subsystem raw water tank and make sure to provide 10 feet of 
clearance between each water purification unit. 
 
4.3.1.3. Position the 20,000-gallon potable water tank approximately 35 feet from 
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units, and then install the tank’s vent, drain 
assembly, and 4-inch inlet elbow (female-to-female) and outlet elbow (female-to-
male) onto the tank. 
 
4.3.1.4. Position the 20,000-gallon brine tank approximately 50 feet from Reverse 
Osmosis Water Purification Units, and then install the tank’s vent, drain assembly, 
and 4-inch elbows. 
 
4.3.1.5. Place the 3,000-gallon wastewater tank approximately 25 feet from the 
brine tank, and then install the tank’s vent and drain assembly. Also, connect the 2-
inch female Quick Disconnect to the tank inlet and 2-inch male Quick Disconnect 
to the tank outlet.

Water Tank Connections (Typical). 
 
 
 
4.3.2. Assemble Raw Water Hoses and Components. Install hoses and components 
from the Water Production Subsystem and Source Run Subsystem raw water tanks 
to Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit locations as illustrated in Figure 4.5. 
 
4.3.2.1. Starting at the outlet branch assembly of the Source Run Subsystem tank, 
attach a 4-inch tee assembly (15) to the previously assembled 4-inch ball valve 
(10). Then connect three 4-inch x 15-foot suction hoses (11) with three tee 
assemblies (9) and two 4-inch ball valves as shown in Figure 4.5. At each tee, 
attach in order, a 4-inch x 2-inch reducer (16), a 2-inch ball valve (17), and a 2-
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
39 
 
inch x 1- 1/2-inch reducer (18). Each of these branches connects to a 1-1/2-inch 
raw water discharge hose leading to water purification units. 
 
Figure 4.5. Raw Water Hoses and Component Layout. 
 
 
 
4.3.2.2. After connecting the 1-1/2-inch reducer to the Reverse Osmosis Water 
Purification Unit hoses, ensure the ball valves at the inlet and outlet sides of the 
Water Production Subsystem raw water tank are open and the ball valves on the 
three branch outlets are closed. Then confirm the ball valves (14) are closed on both 
Water Production Subsystem and Source Run Subsystem raw water tank drain 
hoses. After that, ensure the ball valves on the valve inlets to the Reverse Osmosis 
Water Purification Units are also closed. Keep this configuration until the subsystem 
is ready to begin water production operations. 
 
4.3.3. Assemble Brine Hoses and Components. Install brine hoses and

Chapter 5 
 
550-INITIAL SUBSYSTEM 
 
5.1. General Information. The 550-Initial Subsystem is the primary potable 
water distribution subsystem of the contingency water system. Units may deploy 
this subsystem as a stand-alone potable water distribution subsystem; however, 
manufacturers designed the subsystem for expansion and buildup to meet varying 
user deployment and operational needs. The 550-Initial Subsystem (Figure 5.1) 
normally receives potable water input from the Water Production Subsystem 
discussed in Chapter 4. However, the adapters supplied with this subsystem do 
provide a means to draw potable water from other similar potable water sources. 
Potable water input to the subsystem typically goes to three 20,000-gallon fabric 
tanks for storage. The storage tanks, usually in tank farm configuration, distribute 
the potable water to a variable speed dual pumping station. The two pumps are 
parallel-configured, enabling dual or single pump operation, and single pump 
isolation for maintenance or repair purposes. The remaining operational pump 
maintains water pressure in the distribution line. Output from the pumping station 
runs to a distribution line, looped, and connected to form a pressurized feed line. 
User facilities, such as latrines, showers, and laundries, are branch fed from the 
pressurized feed line. Wastewater output from user facilities distributes via lift 
pumps and wastewater lines to a wastewater collection tank for disposal. Hose 
rollover protection ramps (hose bridges) are available in the event potable water 
distribution and/or wastewater distribution lines cross roadways or similar heavy 
vehicular traffic areas. 
 
5.2. Components. Illustrated in Figure 5.1 and described in Table 5.1 are the 
major components that make up the 550-Initial Subsystem. However, for a 
complete list of all subsystem components, including nomenclature and quantity 
per subsystem, refer to Table 5.4 in this handbook and the 550-Initial Subsystem 
Illustrated Parts Breakdown in Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1.

5.3.2. Position Sewage Ejector Systems. Sewage ejector systems should be 
located next to the facilities they support. Verify an adequate power source is 
available to the sewage ejector tank, and then position sewage ejector systems 
according to the following paragraphs. Note: When installing the sewage ejector 
system, a backhoe or similar digging equipment may be necessary for excavation 
and backfill operations. 
 
 
 
5.3.2.1. Position sewage ejector systems alongside latrine facilities. To determine 
the exact location, first set up the latrine's drain system to verify its exact ending 
point. Then, assemble the inlet and outlet components to the sewage ejector tank 
and excavate a hole for the tank. 
 
5.3.2.2. Excavate a hole large enough to accommodate the station tank to a depth 
of at least 24 inches. Prepare the bottom of the hole with 6 inches of backfill 
material of gravel or stone that is not less than 3/8-inch in diameter or larger than 
3/4-inch in diameter (if available). Ensure the base is level and smooth. 
 
 
 
 
CAUTION 
Damage and/or destruction of Sewage Ejector System 
(Latrine) tank will result if accidental tip-over occurs due 
to equipment or similar contact occurring as the result of 
ground-level installation. To prevent tip-over damage, 
the tank should be installed in-ground to a depth of 24 
inches. 
CAUTION 
In freezing conditions, backfill material must be dry 
and free of ice. Do not use other backfill materials 
unless approved by the manufacturer. 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023

5.3.3. Position 3,000-Gallon Potable Water Tanks. Position 3,000-gallon potable 
water tanks (24) next to their respective facilities (Figure 5.5) as follows: 
 
5.3.3.1. Position one 3,000-gallon potable water tank about 25 feet away from the 
kitchen facility’s water connection. Position additional 3,000-gallon tanks 
approximately 25 feet away and centered between each of the two shower/shave 
and latrine facilities. Each tank will feed one shower/shave and one latrine facility. 
 
5.3.3.2. Position another 3,000-gallon tank directly behind and approximately 25 
feet away from the laundry facility. Afterward, connect all vents and drain 
assemblies to the 3,000-gallon tanks. If a Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources 
laundry facility is used, it comes equipped with its own 3,000-gallon tank that is 
usable in lieu of the tank from the 550-Initial Subsystem.

5.3.4. Assemble Potable Water Distribution Loop and Facility Connections. 
Begin assembling the potable water distribution loop and facility connections as 
depicted in Figure 5.6. Note: If using the 550-Follow-On Subsystem or multiple 
550-Initial/Follow-On Subsystems, the loop on the 550-Initial Subsystem is NOT 
closed but connects to the next subsystem until the last subsystem assembled closes 
the loop. Always ensure hose couplings have neoprene gaskets properly installed 
before connecting hose assemblies. 
 
5.3.4.1. Connect the 3-inch x 25-foot discharge hoses (16) to the outlet of the dual 
pump station. Use as many hoses as required to reach the loop starting point, 
which is along the perimeter of the facility placement area. 
 
5.3.4.2. Connect one 3-inch tee (17) to the end of the discharge hose. Attach 3-
inch ball valves (18) on each end of the 3-inch tee. Next, start laying the loop 
around the camp facility area toward the water-using facilities using 100, 50, and 
25-foot discharge hoses. 
 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
62 
 
5.3.4.3. Connect the first hose to the 3-inch ball valve at the dual pump station 
outlet branch (Figure 5.7) and if possible, route the hose to avoid exposure to high 
volumes of traffic. Use the 100-foot hose (5), 50-foot (19), and 25-foot (16) hoses 
where needed so the hose position ends up centered, and within 20 to 25 feet of 
the inlet side of 3,000-gallon facility tanks. Note: All water tanks (bladders or 
vessels) inserted into the water distribution loop or downstream but connected to 
the Dual Pump Station MUST have a bladder water level controller or be manually 
filled and isolated with a valve inserted on the inlet side of the bladder/vessel.

5.3.4.4. 3,000-Gallon Tank Inlet Connections. Starting at the water distribution 
loop adjacent to each 3,000-gallon facility tank (Figure 5.8), install a 3-inch x 2-
inch tee (20), and attach a 2-inch ball valve (21) on the tee assembly’s branch 
outlet. Next, use one 2-inch x 25-foot discharge hose (22) and connect to the 
bladder water level controller (23). Attach another 2-inch ball valve to the inlet of 
the 3,000-gallon tank and connect the bladder water level controller directly to the 
2-inch valve (Figure 5.9). Note: If necessary to connect facilities “directly” to the 
water distribution loop, installers must convey the potential consequences of this 
configuration and should install shut-off valves/pressure regulators and establish a 
quick response capability to mitigate damages if a failure occurs. The water 
distribution loop is constantly pressurized at about 45-55 pounds per square inch 
(depending on camp size). Those high pressures could damage equipment, flood 
areas, and deplete camp water supplies if the facility plumbing fail.

5.4.2. Verify Potable Water Production. Ensure potable water from the water 
production subsystem or alternate potable water collection system is flowing into 
20,000-gallon potable water tanks. While the 20,000-gallon tanks are filling, 
recheck all hose assemblies, valves, fittings, and tanks for leaks. When 20,000-
gallon tanks have sufficient water (at least 1/4 full), recheck all hose assemblies, 
valves, and fittings for leaks, and make needed repairs. Also, make sure that the 
dual pumping station connects to an adequate power source. Afterward, ensure 
the inlet and outlet valves on the dual pumping station are open. Note: During 
filling operations, it will be necessary to monitor the level of all 20,000-gallon 
potable water tanks. When tanks become full, it will be necessary to shut down 
the water production subsystem or potable water collection system.

5.4.4.2. Pull the EMERGENCY STOP button out on the control panel and set 
Pump 1–OFF/ENABLED switch to ENABLED. Verify Pump 1-ENABLED and 
RUN indicators are illuminated and that Pump 1 rotation is clockwise. Then, set 
Pump 2–OFF/ENABLED switch to ENABLED. Verify Pump 2-ENABLED and 
RUN indicators are illuminated and that Pump 2 rotation is clockwise. Then verify 
SYSTEM PRESSURE is preset to 45 pounds per square inch. 
 
5.4.4.3. Verify the SYSTEM FLOW and SYSTEM PRESSURE meters stabilize 
after the entire system is pressurized. 
 
5.4.4.4. Verify the Chlorine Feed System–FEED TANK LOW indicator light is 
off and that the fault indicators are not illuminated. If a fault indication is 
illuminated, open the panel and briefly press RESET then START pushbuttons. 
If indications recur, refer to the installation and operation manual to troubleshoot 
the problem. 
 
5.4.4.5. On the chlorine feed tank, adjust the STROKE knob for the desired 
chlorine solution level. Use the SAMPLE WATER ball valve (Figure 5.31) to 
draw water into a container and check required chlorine level. It may be necessary 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023

to readjust the STROKE knob and resample the water until achieving the desired 
chlorine level. When completed, lower the plastic shield on the feed pump control 
panel. 
 
Figure 5.31. Sample Water Ball Valve. 
 
 
 
5.4.5. Check Potable Water Distribution Loop. Ensure potable water is flowing 
through the water distribution loop. Then, connect bladder water level controllers 
to an adequate power source at each 3,000-gallon potable water tank. Adjust the 
bladder water level controls as necessary (see Figure 5.32 and Table 5.3 for 
Controls and Indicators) and verify 3,000-gallon tanks are being filled. Then, 
recheck all hoses, valves, and fittings throughout the potable water distribution 
loop and 3,000-gallon tanks for leaks. Make any needed repairs. Note: 
Contingency water systems tend to leak a little, so small leaks are usually 
unavoidable and should not be a major cause of concern. Always ensure hose 
couplings have neoprene gaskets properly installed before connecting hose 
assemblies.

5.4.6. Check Facilities Operation. Once the 3,000-gallon tanks for shower, latrine, 
laundry, and kitchen facilities have sufficient water, check the operation of these 
facilities according to their respective technical orders. 
 
5.4.7. Verify Wastewater Collection. Check wastewater collection lines by first 
turning on and allowing water to run in connected facilities. Then complete the 
following procedures: 
 
 
 
5.4.7.1. Connect the sewage ejector system to an adequate power source and verify 
correct pump operation by allowing the latrine holding tank to empty into the 
sewage ejector system. Repeat this step for each ejector system utilized. 
 
5.4.7.2. Check the hose line, valves, and fittings leading to the macerator pump 
lift station for leaks and make needed repairs. 
 
5.4.7.3. Set the macerator pump lift station HAND/OFF/AUTO power switch to 
AUTO (Figure 5.33) and verify the PUMP RUN indicator on the front of the 
control box is illuminated. Then, verify the SEAL FAIL indicator on the side of 
the control box is off and the macerator pump lift station is operating correctly. 
 
5.4.7.4. Check the hose line, valves, and fittings leading to the dual pump lift 
station for leaks and make any needed repairs. 
 
5.4.7.5. On the dual pump lift station, open the power panel door and set the Pump 
1-HAND/OFF/AUTO power switch to AUTO (Figure 5.34). Then verify the 
Pump 1–PUMP RUNNING indicator on the front of the control box is illuminated 
and the Pump 1-SEAL FAIL indicator is off. Next, set the Pump 2-HAND/OFF/ 
WARNING

AUTO power switch to AUTO and verify the Pump 2-SEAL FAIL indicator is 
off. Afterward, verify the dual pump lift station is operating correctly. 
 
5.4.7.6. Check the hose line, valves, and fittings leading to the 25,000-gallon 
wastewater collection tank for leaks and make any needed repairs. When sufficient 
water has accumulated in the 25,000-gallon waste tank, open the lower (left) stage 
ball valve on the intake assembly, ensuring the middle and upper stage ball valves 
on feeding mixer assembly are closed. Then turn on the circulation pump and verify 
operation of the aerator assembly. As the tank level rises, sequentially turn on the 
middle (center) and upper stage ball valves for complete system operation. Then, 
check hose assemblies, valves, and fittings for leaks and make needed repairs.

5.4.7.7. The wastewater tank needs to be emptied periodically using either a sewage 
suction trailer/truck, or by contract. Make sure that either the mixing pump is 
shutdown, or the stage ball valves are shut off sequentially as the tank is emptied; 
top/right, middle, bottom/left.  If suction is all the way down to the bottom stage, 
shut the pump down. Note: Keeping the system running while pumping the tank 
has advantages because the sludge keeps moving constantly minimizing bottom 
tank buildup and better tank evacuation. 
 
5.4.8. Monitor Potable Water Tank Levels. Keep an eye on the water level of 
20,000-gallon and 3,000-gallon potable water tanks throughout the operation of 
the system. Shut down and start up the Source Run Subsystem, the Water 
Production Subsystem, and/or the 125-gallons per minute Diesel Pump as 
necessary to maintain the required amount of water storage. Attachment 6 lists 
normal operating steps after the system is initially filled and functioning normally.

550-FOLLOW-ON SUBSYSTEM 
 
6.1. General Information. The 550-Follow-On Subsystem expands and builds 
off the 550-Initial Subsystem; manufacturers did not design it to function alone. 
When used as an expansion to the 550-Initial Subsystem, this system functions 
identically to the 550-Initial Subsystem. User facilities, such as latrines, showers, 
laundries, and kitchen (Figure 6.1) are branch fed from the pressurized potable 
water distribution loop or feed line. Wastewater output from user facilities 
distributes via lift pumps and wastewater lines to a wastewater collection tank for 
disposal. Hose rollover protection ramps (hose bridges) are available if potable 
and/or wastewater distribution lines need to cross roadways or similar heavy 
vehicular traffic areas. 
 
Figure 6.1. User Facilities (Typical). 
 
 
 
6.2. Components. Illustrated in Figure 6.2 and described in Table 6.1 are the 
major components that make up the 550-Follow-On Subsystem. However, for a 
complete list of all subsystem components, including nomenclature and quantity 
per subsystem, refer to Table 6.3 in this handbook and the 550-Follow-On 
Subsystem Illustrated Parts Breakdown in Technical Order 40W4-21-1-WA-1.

6.3. Installation. Before installing the 550-Follow-On Subsystem, orient the 
subsystem in relation to the other subsystems. Then, refer to component layout 
diagrams in this chapter and the list in Table 6.3 to identify each numbered 
component when performing the steps below. 
 
 
 
6.3.1. Expand the Potable Water Tank Farm. Expand the initial potable water tank 
farm (Figure 6.3) by using the 550-Follow-On Subsystem’s 20,000-gallon tanks 
as follows. 
 
Figure 6.3. Initial Tank Farm Configuration (Typical). 
 
 
 
6.3.1.1. Using Figure 6.4 as a guide, position additional 550-Follow-On 
Subsystem 20,000-gallon potable water tanks (4) across from the existing tanks 
by spacing them approximately 6 feet apart. Align the tank outlets with the 
manifold joint connections. 
 
WARNING

6.3.1.2. Install the vent and drain assembly, 4-inch inlet elbow Quick Disconnect 
(female-to-female), and 4-inch outlet elbow Quick Disconnect (female-to-male) 
onto each of the tanks (Figure 6.5). 
 
6.3.1.3. Working backwards from the dual pump station inlet, begin assembling 
each 550-Follow-On tank outlet branch as shown in Figure 6.6. On the first tank 
outlet, attach a 4-inch x 15-foot suction hose (1) followed by a 4-inch ball valve 
(3) and 4-inch tee (7). Align the tee with the manifold to gauge the final 
connection distance, but do not connect the tee to the manifold at this time. Repeat 
these procedures for the remaining 550F tanks. Note: When aligning the tee with 
the manifold, position the tee slightly passed the manifold because the suction 
hose will move back toward the tank during filling operations.

6.3.1.4. Using Figure 6.7 as a guide, close the inlet 4-inch ball valves that supply 
water to the existing tank farm. Then, shut down the dual pump station and close 
the outlet 4-inch ball valves on all tanks within the tank farm. Next, insert each 
550-Follow-On tank outlet tee into the 4-inch manifold. Note: Normally, operators 
should keep tank inlet ball valves closed except during filling operations. If valves 
remain open, a single tank leak can drain ALL tanks through back feeding.

the outlet end of the tee. Then, working away from the first tank, connect 4-inch 
suction hoses, ball valves, and tee assemblies to the remaining two tank inlets. 
 
6.3.1.5.3. Next, insert two 4-inch x 15-foot hoses (1) between each 20,000-gallon 
tank. Connect the hoses to the 4-inch tee assemblies already in place. Then, 
connect two more 15-foot hoses to the tee assembly on the last tank. At the end 
of the 15-foot hose, attach the branch end of another 4-inch tee and install a 4-
inch ball valve on the outlet end of the tee. Note: Always ensure hose couplings 
have neoprene gaskets properly installed before connecting hose assemblies.

hoses as depicted in Figure 6.9 to close the water feed inlet lines to the Follow-
On tanks. 
 
Figure 6.9. Assembly of Water Feed Inlet Lines for Follow-On Tanks. 
 
 
 
6.3.1.7. To recharge the potable water distribution loop and fill the 550F 20,000-
gallon tanks after tank farm expansion, complete the following procedures. 
 
6.3.1.7.1. Ensure the 550F tank outlet ball valves are in the closed position as 
illustrated in Figure 6.10. Then open the Water Production Subsystem and 550I 
tank outlet ball valves and turn on the Dual Pump Station (allows the Water 
Production Subsystem and 550I tanks to recharge the distribution loop). 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
110 
 
Afterward, open the ball valve on the branch tee and begin filling 550F tanks 
(ensure tank inlet ball valves are in the OPEN position). 
 
6.3.1.7.2. Once the 550F tanks are full, close tank inlets and begin normal use of 
the expanded tank farm. Make sure to rotate tank use throughout the tank farm to 
prevent water stagnation and refill tanks as needed.

6.3.2. Install Latrine Sewage Ejector Systems. Install 550-Follow-On Subsystem 
sewage ejector systems (latrines) next to their respective facilities as follows. 
 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
111 
 
6.3.2.1. Ensure an adequate power source is available to the sewage ejector tank 
and position the sewage ejector system alongside the latrine facility (Figure 
6.11). To determine the exact location, first set up the latrine's drain system to 
verify its exact ending point. Then, assemble the inlet and outlet components to 
the sewage ejector tank. Note: When installing the sewage ejector system, a 
backhoe or similar digging equipment may be necessary for excavation and 
backfill operations. 
 
Figure 6.11. Sewage Ejector System Installed Next to Latrine Facility. 
 
 
 
6.3.2.2. Excavate a hole large enough to accommodate the sewage ejector tank to 
a depth of at least 24 inches. Prepare the bottom of the hole with 6 inches of 
backfill material of gravel or stone that is not less than 3/8-inch in diameter or 
larger than 3/4-inch in diameter (if available). Ensure the base is level and smooth.

6.3.2.3. Lower the sewage ejector tank into the hole and insert backfill material 
until it reaches ground level. 
 
6.3.3. Install Kitchen Sewage Ejector Lift Station. Similar to latrines, ensure an 
adequate power source is available to the lift station and position the kitchen 
sewage ejector lift station alongside the kitchen facility. To determine the exact 
location, first set up the kitchen’s drain system to verify its exact ending point. 
Then assemble the inlet and outlet components to the lift station tank and perform 
the following procedures: 
 
 
 
6.3.3.1. Excavate a hole large enough to accommodate the lift station tank to a 
depth of at least 24 inches. Prepare the bottom of the hole with 6 inches of backfill 
material of gravel or stone that is not less than 3/8-inch in diameter or larger than 
3/4-inch in diameter (if available). Ensure the base is level and smooth. 
 
6.3.3.2. Lower the lift station tank into the hole and insert backfill material until 
it reaches ground level. 
 
 
CAUTION 
In freezing conditions, backfill material must be dry 
and free of ice. Do not use other backfill materials 
unless approved by the manufacturer. 
CAUTION 
Damage or destruction of Sewage Ejector Lift Station 
(Kitchen) tank will result if accidental tip-over occurs 
due to equipment or similar contact occurring as the 
result of ground-level installation. To prevent tip-over 
damage, the tank should be installed in-ground to a depth 
of 18 inches. 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
113 
 
6.3.4. Position 3,000-Gallon Potable Water Tanks. Position the four 3,000-gallon 
potable water tanks from the 550-Follow-On subsystem next to their respective 
facilities or predesignated facility locations (Figure 6.12). 
 
6.3.4.1. Position one 3,000-gallon potable water tank approximately 25 feet away 
from the kitchen’s water connection. 
 
6.3.4.2. Position the next two 3,000-gallon potable water tanks approximately 25 
feet away and centered between each of the two shower/shave and latrine facilities 
to where each tank will feed one shower/shave and one latrine facility. 
 
6.3.4.3. Position the last 3,000-gallon potable water tank directly behind and 
approximately 25 feet away from the laundry facility. 
 
Figure 6.12. Placement of 3,000-Gallon Potable Water Tanks (Typical). 
 
 
 
6.3.4.4. Finally, connect vent and drain assemblies to all 3,000-gallon tanks. Note: 
All water tanks (bladders or vessels) inserted into the water distribution loop or 
downstream but connected to the Dual Pump Station MUST have a bladder water 
level controller or be manually filled and isolated with a valve inserted on the inlet 
side of the bladder/vessel. 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
114 
 
6.3.5. Expand Potable Water Distribution Loop and Facility Connections. Using the 
potable water components in the 550-Follow-On Subsystem, expand the 550-
Initial Subsystem potable water distribution loop and facility connections 
according to requirements at the deployment location. Figure 6.13 provides a 
basic example of a distribution loop expansion. Note: Always ensure hose 
couplings have neoprene gaskets properly installed before connecting hose 
assemblies. 
 
Figure 6.13. Expanded Water Distribution Loop Component Layout. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
115 
 
6.3.5.1. Beginning at the outlet of the dual pump station’s 3-inch branch tee, begin 
expanding the potable water distribution loop by connecting the 3-inch x 100-foot 
discharge hoses (9) to the 3-inch ball valve on the branch tee. 
 
6.3.5.2. Using 3-inch discharge hoses in lengths of 100 feet (9), 50 feet (8), and 
25 feet (11), lay out the potable water distribution loop toward the water-using 
facilities. If possible, route the hose away from high traffic areas. It may be 
preferable to use the 3-inch x 100-foot hoses first, then the 50-foot and 25-foot hoses 
where needed to properly position the hose so it is centered and within 20 to 25 feet 
of the inlet side of facility 3,000-gallon tanks. Note: If hose rollover protection 
becomes necessary, assemble, and install hose bridge system as illustrated in 
Attachment 5. 
 
6.3.5.3. Assemble 3,000-Gallon Tank Inlet Connections. At the potable water 
distribution loop adjacent to each 3,000-gallon facility tank (Figure 6.14), install 
a 3-inch x 2-inch tee (10) and attach a 2-inch ball valve (13) on the tee assembly’s 
branch outlet. Next, insert a 2-inch x 25-foot discharge hose (14) between the ball 
valve and the bladder water level controller (15). Finally, attach another 2-inch 
ball valve directly to the bladder water level controller and connect the other end 
of the valve to the inlet of the 3,000-gallon tank (16). Note: If necessary to connect 
facilities “directly” to the water distribution loop, installers must convey the 
potential consequences of this configuration and should install shut-off 
valves/pressure regulators and establish a quick response capability to mitigate 
damages if a failure occurs. The water distribution loop is constantly pressurized at 
about 45-55 pounds per square inch (depending on camp size), and pressures that 
high could damage equipment, flood areas, and deplete camp water supplies if the 
facility’s plumbing fail. 
 
6.3.5.4. Assemble 3,000-Gallon Tank Outlet Connections. Outlet connections on 
3,000-gallon tanks vary according to the type of facility supported. Assemble the 
outlet manifold of each 3,000-gallon tank as follows. 
 
6.3.5.4.1. Shower and Latrine Facilities. As depicted in Figure 6.15, connect a 2-
inch ball valve (13) to the outlet of the 3,000-gallon tank (16). Next, connect a 2-
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
116 
 
inch x 25-foot discharge hose (14) to the ball valve followed by a 2-inch tee (17). 
Afterward, connect a 2-inch x 3/4-inch reducer (19) to the tee for the latrine and 
a 2-inch x 1-inch reducer (20) on the opposite end of the tee for the shower.

valve (13) to the outlet of the 3,000-gallon tank (16). Then connect a 2-inch x 25-
foot discharge hose (14) to the ball valve followed by a 2-inch tee (17). Lastly, 
connect a 2-inch x 1-1/2-inch reducer (18) to each open end of the tee. 
 
Figure 6.16. 3,000-Gallon Tank Outlet Connections (Laundry). 
 
 
 
6.3.5.4.3. Kitchen Facility. Connect a 2-inch ball valve (13) to the outlet of the 
3,000-gallon tank (16) as shown in Figure 6.17. Then connect a 2-inch x 25-foot 
discharge hose (14) to the ball valve followed by a 2-inch tee (17). Afterward, 
connect a 2-inch x 1-inch reducer (21) to each open end of the tee. 
 
6.3.5.5. After connecting all facilities, continue assembling 3-inch x 100-foot (9) 
and 3-inch x 50-foot (8) discharge hoses (see Figure 6.13) until they connect or 
interface with the 550-Initial Subsystem’s potable water distribution hose, 
forming a loop around the camp. Note: If using multiple 550 (Initial/Follow-On) 
subsystems, connect each subsystem to the next until the last subsystem assembled 
closes the loop.

6.4.2. Verify Potable Water Flow. Verify water is flowing in the 3-inch potable 
water distribution loop. Ensure an adequate power source connection to bladder 
water level controllers at each 3,000-gallon potable water tank. Verify 3,000-
gallon tanks fills with water. Recheck all hoses, valves, and fittings throughout 
the 3-inch potable water loop and the 3,000-gallon tanks for leaks. Make repairs 
as necessary. 
 
6.4.3. Check Facilities Operation. Once the 3,000-gallon tanks for shower, latrine, 
laundry, and kitchen facilities have sufficient water, check the operation of these 
facilities according to their respective technical orders. 
 
6.4.4. Check Wastewater Collection. Check wastewater collection lines by first 
turning on and allowing water to run in connected facilities. Then complete the 
following procedures. 
 
 
 
6.4.4.1. Connect the sewage ejector system (latrine) to an adequate power source 
and verify correct pump operation by allowing the latrine holding tank to empty 
into the sewage ejector system. Repeat this step for each sewage ejector system 
(latrine) utilized. 
 
WARNING 
To prevent injury or death to personnel, make sure 
Source Power is OFF before connecting power input to

RUN indicator on the front of the control box is illuminated. Then, verify the 
SEAL FAIL indicator on the side of the control box is OFF and the macerator 
pump lift station is operating correctly. 
 
6.4.4.5. Check the hose line, valves, and fittings leading to the dual pump lift 
station for leaks and make any needed repairs. Note: Contingency water systems 
tend to leak a little, so small leaks are usually unavoidable and should not be a 
major cause of concern. Always ensure hose couplings have neoprene gaskets 
properly installed before connecting hose assemblies. 
 
6.4.5. Monitor Potable Water Tank Levels. Keep an eye on the level of the 20,000-
gallon potable water tanks and the 3,000-gallon potable water tanks throughout the 
operation of the system. Shut down and start up the Source Run Subsystem, the 
Water Production Subsystem, and/or the 125-gallons per minute Diesel Pump as 
necessary to maintain the required amount of water storage.

(17), followed by two 1-inch x 25-foot discharge hoses (18). If needed, attach a 
1-inch x 3/4 inch reducer (19) to the end of one of the discharge hoses. Then 
connect the discharge hoses to the user facilities. 
 
7.3.1.5.4. On the inlet of the 3,000-gallon tank, connect a 2-inch ball valve (3); 
and the bladder water level controller (5). Next, connect a 2-inch x 50-foot 
discharge hose (4) to the controller, then attach a 3-inch x 2-inch reducer (15) to 
the other end of the hose. Then, connect a 3-inch check valve (12) to the reducer. 
 
7.3.1.5.5. Starting at the check valve (12), connect enough 3-inch discharge hoses 
(13, 14) to reach the 35-gallons per minute pump and complete the connection to 
the water distribution loop. 
 
7.3.2. If any of the subsystem plumbing crosses roadways or similar heavy 
vehicular traffic areas, use the hose bridge system to provide hose rollover 
protection. Assemble the hose bridge system as shown in Attachment 5. This 
completes basic installation of the Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension 
Subsystem assembly. 
 
7.4. Operation. The following procedures address basic steps to operate the 
Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem after installation. If 
necessary, refer back to the basic layout diagrams presented throughout this 
chapter for component identification. 
 
7.4.1. Perform Extension Subsystem Preoperational Checks. Before operating the

7.4.2. Initiate and Verify Potable Water Flow. Initiate and verify water flow to the 
extension subsystem as follows: 
 
7.4.2.1. Open the 2-inch ball valve on the inlet to the 2-inch hose line and connect 
the bladder water level controller for the first 3,000-gallon tank to an adequate 
power source. Ensure the first 3,000-gallon tank begins to fill with water, and then 
recheck hoses, valves, and fittings to the outlet of the tank for leaks. Repair as 
required. 
 
7.4.2.2. Once the 3,000-gallon tank is full, open the outlet ball valve and position 
the power ON/OFF switch for the electric pump to the ON position. Verify water 
is flowing from the first 3,000-gallon tank through the pump to the bladder water 
level controller on the facility tank. Then connect the second bladder water level 
controller to an adequate power source and verify water is flowing into the facility 
tank. 
 
7.4.2.3. Recheck all hoses, valves, and fittings from the electric pump to the 
facility tank for leaks. Make any necessary repairs. Note: Contingency water 
systems tend to leak a little, so small leaks are usually unavoidable and should not 
be a major cause of concern. Always ensure hose couplings have neoprene gaskets 
properly installed before connecting hose assemblies. 
 
7.4.2.4. When the 3,000-gallon facility tank is full, it is ready for service if the 
using facilities are connected. The 35-gallons per minute electric pump operates 
automatically and should not require any user input to maintain water level in the 
facility tank.

WATER SYSTEM 
 
Table A6.1. Normal Operating Procedures. 
NORMAL OPERATION 
The following procedures highlight basic operation of the Contingency Water 
System and do not have to be performed in the order presented here. These 
procedures assume the system was initially fully filled and currently 
functioning normally. Users should read and understand subsystem 
operational procedures in T.O. 40W4-20-1-WA-1 prior to system operation. 
A. 
Inspect all tanks, hoses, valves, and connections for leaks and repair as 
required.

Regularly check the level of the 20,000-gallon potable water tanks of 
the 550 Initial and 550 Follow-On (if equipped) Subsystems and 
proceed as follows: 
(1) If the height of all potable water tanks is at least 36 inches, proceed 
to Step C. 
(2) If the height of all potable water tanks is less than 36 inches and the 
source of potable water is the Water Production 1500 Reverse Osmosis 
Water Purification Unit Subsystem, proceed to Step C. 
(3) If the height of all potable water tanks is less than 36 inches and the 
source of potable water is the 125-gallons per minute Diesel Pump that 
is part of the 550 Initial Subsystem, proceed to Step E. 
C. 
Check the height of the 20,000-gallon raw water tanks from the Water 
Production 1500 Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit 
Subsystem(s) and Source Run Subsystem (if installed) and proceed as 
follows: 
 
AFTTP3-32.34V4  7 DECEMBER 2023 
159 
 
(1) If the height of the tanks is at least 36 inches and potable water is 
not required for the 550 Initial and 550 Follow-On (if installed) 
Subsystems, continue to monitor tank levels. No action is required at 
this time. 
(2) If the height of the tanks is at least 36 inches and potable water is 
required for the 550 Initial and 550 Follow-On (if installed) Subsystems 
operate Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units in accordance with 
applicable Technical Order as required. 
NOTE 
If operation of Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units are required, 
it may be necessary to operate the 400-gallons per minute Diesel Pump 
(or 125-gallons per minute Diesel Pump if used) as required to supply 
sufficient raw water for Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit 
operation (refer to Step F). 
(3) If the height of the tanks is less than 36 inches and the Source Run 
Subsystem is installed, proceed to Step D. to startup 400-gallons per 
minute Diesel Pump. 
(4) If the height of the tanks is less than 36 inches and the Source Run 
Subsystem is not installed proceed to Step E. to startup 125-gallons per 
minute Diesel Pump. 
D. 
Monitor the height of the 20,000-gallon raw water tanks and proceed as 
follows: 
(1) Startup the 400-gallons per minute Diesel Pump in accordance with 
Operator's Manual Power Tech4.5/6.8 L Tier 2 Original Equipment 
Manufacturer Diesel Engines. 
(2) Allow pump to run and fill 20,000-gallon raw water tanks. Proceed 
to Step F. 
E.

CAUTION 
Do not operate 125-gallons per minute Diesel Pump Assembly without 
water in pump case. Operating pump without liquid flowing through it 
will damage pump seals and make pump inoperative. 
(1) Remove pump plug and fill pump case with water. Reinstall pump 
plug. 
(2) Remove engine fuel fill cap and fill and/or verify tank is full. 
Reinstall engine fuel fill cap. 
(3) Remove engine oil fill cap and check oil level. Add oil as required 
and reinstall fill cap.
