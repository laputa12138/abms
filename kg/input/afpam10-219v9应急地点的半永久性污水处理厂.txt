Chapter 1 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Overview. This publication addresses wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) alternatives for 
contingency locations. These alternatives provide a starting point to address risk factors related to 
wastewater treatment. Much of the technical information in this publication comes from 
requirements established by unified, multi-service, and DAF subject matter experts. While the 
information may reflect Department of Defense (DoD) guidance for environmentally responsible 
stewardship of contingency locations, DO NOT use this information as directive or authoritative 
guidance. The information in this publication does not supersede any legal requirements (domestic 
US law for operations in the US and for operations outside the US: US law with extraterritorial 
application, applicable international agreement requirement, or Combatant Command directive) 
that specifies wastewater treatment options, procedures, or associated requirements. Rather, the 
information addresses general techniques and procedures only. The type of systems available for 
use at a particular contingency location depends on what is required, authorized, and restricted by 
international agreements, DoD directives, and operational (e.g., Combatant Command) 
requirements. For additional information, consult the references listed in paragraph 1.3 and 
Attachment 1. The Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) has a Reachback capability to 
answer additional engineering, readiness, and environmental concerns. Personnel may contact the 
AFCEC Reachback Center by e-mailing AFCEC.RBC@us.af.mil.  
 
1.2. General Information. Approximately 80 percent of water used during contingency 
operations, other than for human consumption, becomes wastewater and requires treatment or 
disposal. Wastewater created at contingency locations includes black water and gray water. As 
used here, black water is latrine or toilet wastewater containing human waste or fecal matter. 
Although it is sometimes treated with chemicals and reused for purposes such as irrigation of 
certain non-food crops and dust control, black water is generally not recycled as potable water 
during contingency operations. Conversely, gray water refers to wastewater from non-latrine 
sources such as showers, laundries, kitchens (except from food grinders/garbage disposals), 
vehicle wash racks, and hand-washing stations. Recycling gray water from showers, sinks, 
laundries, and other non-potable water sources conserves energy and water, protects the 
environment, and is part of joint engineer doctrine. Recycled gray water can be an option for 
irrigation, showering/hand washing, laundry, toilet flushing, vehicle wash racks, mechanical 
heating/cooling processes, and reintroduction into fresh water sources. It is important to remember 
the hazards of storing gray water for extended periods. If allowed to sit, gray water can turn into 
stagnant, sludge-filled concoctions of bacteria and pathogens—it can essentially become black 
water in as little as 24 hours if not filtered and treated. Civil Engineers (CE) have primary 
responsibility for managing wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal, particularly in an 
expeditionary environment. The tactics, techniques, and procedures for these functions primarily 
depend on location, capabilities, and the environment. Onsite, simplified conventional wastewater 
systems such as septic tanks, lagoons, and leach fields provide appropriate treatment for most 
contingency locations. These systems provide effective treatment, significantly reduce risks to 
public health, and likely are the lowest-cost alternative for deployed/contingency locations if 
international agreements, operational directives, or site conditions do not prohibit their use.

1.3. Engineer Doctrine and Standards. Air Force Civil Engineers remain cognizant of various 
DoD and theater-level engineering and environmental guidance affecting wastewater treatment 
solutions at contingency locations. Relevant guidance includes Department of Defense Instruction 
(DoDI) 4715.22, Environmental Management Policy for Contingency Locations; Air Force 
Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 3-34, Engineer Operations; Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222, 
Volume 4, Environmental Considerations for Overseas Contingency Operations; Joint Publication 
(JP) 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations; JP 4-03, Joint Bulk Petroleum and Water Doctrine, and 
Combatant Command (CCMD) contingency construction and environmental guidance in the 
Environmental Annex of the contingency operation OPLAN and/or OPORD. Find additional 
resources using the engineer Reachback links in Attachment 2. 
 
1.3.1. The anticipated mission and duration of overseas operations determine expeditionary 
construction standards. CE organizes, trains, and equips its personnel to provide capabilities 
suitable for any environment or range of military operations—from beddown at initial 
contingency locations to supporting sustainment at permanent bases. The information presented 
in this publication supplements CE training, and when combined with other technical resources 
and guidance, supports delivery of engineer capability to combatant commanders. This 
information is not a replacement for engineering design and analysis; instead, it offers potential 
solutions and points the reader to documents and sources of information by authorities in the 
wastewater treatment field. Qualified and experienced wastewater civil engineers may find the 
information useful when planning/developing onsite wastewater treatment solutions at 
contingency locations. 
 
1.3.2. CE personnel use conventional and expedient means for wastewater disposition, 
including connecting to local or municipal sewage systems, collecting and retaining wastewater 
for contractor removal to fixed treatment facilities, or using onsite and field expedient systems. 
Examples of wastewater treatment and disposal methods addressed here include septic systems, 
leach fields, sewage lagoons, sand filters, seepage pits, soakage pits and trenches, and 
evaporative beds. CE personnel have a keen awareness that expeditionary and expedient 
construction can differ from US conventional standards and requirements. Unlike most 
domestic or in-garrison situations where water usage is virtually uncontrolled and unlimited, 
CE guidance provides expeditionary planning factors for water usage and disposal for deployed 
forces. For example, the common planning factor for water usage in austere conditions is 30 
gallons per capita per day (gpcd), of which approximately 20 gpcd will need to be disposed of 
in some manner. Early planning for expedient wastewater management is essential to protect 
the health of the deployed force. Portions of the wastewater treatment and disposal information 
presented here was adapted from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 625/1-80-012, 
Design Manual, Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems, EPA 625/R-00/008, 
Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems Manual, and other design manuals. For more 
information on wastewater planning, review AFH 10-222V4.  
 
1.4. Public Health Risks Associated with Untreated Wastewater. There are a variety of ways 
people could contact untreated wastewater, including recreational aquatic activities in 
contaminated water bodies, bathing, washing clothes or utensils, during food preparation, or 
ingesting vegetation exposed to contaminated water sources. Contamination can occur by direct 
consumption or by more subtle contact with the skin, eyes, or ears. 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023

1.4.1. Constituents of Wastewater. Wastewater contains a combination of biological and 
chemical waste products. After use, this water can return to the environment and rejoin the 
hydrologic cycle by discharging into a surface water body (such as a lake or stream) or into 
groundwater. Left untreated, this wastewater can harm the health and wellbeing of deployed 
personnel, local populations, and ecosystems. Biological wastes can contain harmful organisms 
such as waterborne pathogens that can cause a myriad of illnesses including, but not limited to, 
cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and other infections. While some of the illnesses may pass in a few 
days to a week, they can also last much longer and without proper treatment can cause long-
term damage or fatalities. Untreated sewage also contains high volumes of nutrients, which, 
when discharged to the environment can, among other impacts, fertilize algae populations and 
cause blooms to develop. These blooms can be toxic to humans and damage aquatic 
environments. 
 
1.4.2. International Guidance for Sanitation and Health. As identified by the World Health 
Organization, countries are at varying levels of sanitation awareness and sensitivity to 
wastewater treatment and the protection of both groundwater and surface waters. Largely, these 
differences center on cultural, educational, and economic development factors. In industrial 
countries, degradation of surface and groundwater sources has been a consequence of economic 
development while environmental impacts have been a lesser priority. In undeveloped 
countries, cultural practices, and a lack of education about the relationship between water 
quality and disease is unfortunately still a major world health issue. The international 
community has acknowledged the severity of the problems caused by deteriorating water 
quality and, to some extent, is taking action to protect the quality of freshwater resources. 
 
1.4.3. Goals and Considerations. A goal at every expeditionary site is to reduce health risks to 
personnel and provide environmental protection in support of sustainable clean water for use 
onsite and in the surrounding community. With this intent, the following considerations are 
important when determining the requirements for any onsite treatment facility: 
 
• Type of water supply used onsite and by the surrounding community. 
• Site proximity to surface waters and/or wetland areas. 
• Site proximity to local farms for potential reuse of treated wastewaters. 
• Awareness of local environmental concerns. 
 
1.4.3.1. Guidance and standards vary from location to location; personnel can adjust the 
design methods in this publication to meet local requirements and loading. With the 
information provided herein and preparation of a site evaluation, units can develop an 
appropriate wastewater management solution for their deployment site. 
 
1.4.3.2. Even after a WWTF, methods, and systems are in place at contingency locations, 
there may still be areas on the base that need expedient systems. This may be due to distance 
from the primary treatment system(s) or due to shortages of Basic Expeditionary Airfield 
Resources that have not yet arrived. Personnel can review AFTTP 3-32.33V1, Expedient 
Hygiene, Water, and Waste Methods and AFTTP 3-32.34V1, Civil Engineer Bare Base 
Development, for expedient options and alternative solutions.

SYSTEMS OVERVIEW AND SITE SELECTION FACTORS 
 
2.1. General Information. The approach to wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal at 
overseas contingency locations depends on several factors. These include CCMD or coalition 
guidance, international agreements, local site conditions, and deployment site requirements. 
Engineers use site screening and system selection factors to design and operate wastewater 
facilities and systems to ensure protection of health and safety. The advantages of adequate 
screening and planning for wastewater management is that it helps ensure projects meet 
requirements, complies with applicable standards, are programmed at the lowest life cycle costs, 
achieve resource efficiency, and minimize damage to the environment. This chapter identifies 
various onsite wastewater treatment alternatives, favorable criteria for siting facilities, and the 
required soil, site, and climate conditions that affect the design, operation, and performance of 
wastewater treatment and disposal systems. Certain information presented here was adapted from 
EPA 625/1-80-012 and EPA 625/R-00/008. Find these and other EPA wastewater treatment 
system publications at https://search.epa.gov/epasearch/epasearch. 
 
2.2. Wastewater Treatment Alternatives. At initial, temporary, and semi-permanent 
contingency locations, connection to an existing wastewater collection system (while preferred)  
is often impractical or impossible. Therefore, engineers may need to develop or employ onsite 
wastewater treatment and disposal solutions to support the planned size and population density of 
the location. The design of the wastewater treatment system should meet the anticipated effluent 
or incoming waste load. Below is a list of various onsite treatment methods, followed by their 
description, advantages and disadvantages, and key selection factors. Chapter 3 addresses specific 
design and alternatives for these wastewater treatment methods. 
 
• Conventional septic systems 
• Lagoons 
• Sand filters 
• Natural land treatment systems 
• Commercial systems and package plants 
• Disinfection units 
 
2.2.1. Conventional Septic Systems. A standard septic system has a septic tank, distribution box 
and drain pipes in a leach field. Some soil conditions may require an alternate leach field 
location. Additional, alternative pretreatment units may be required to meet stricter effluent 
standards. Grease, non-biodegradable products, and industrial wastewater should not discharge 
into these systems. For this reason, garbage grinders are not allowed in septic tanks systems. 
 
2.2.1.1. A conventional septic system allows filtration of the treated effluent to the 
groundwater below (Figure 2.1). Septic systems are simple and well suited to small 
populations located in semi-rural areas; the effluent quality is not well suited for 
environmentally sensitive areas, and non-sanitary debris introduced into the system can 
create significant performance problems. More sophisticated small treatment systems use 
septic tanks for pre-treatment. A main component in many onsite treatment and collection

alternatives, the septic tank provides pretreatment for conventional subsurface soil 
absorption systems and commercial systems when applied under the conditions identified in 
Table 2.1. Listed in Table 2.2 are key advantages and disadvantages of septic systems. 
Personnel can find additional technical information in the International Private Sewage 
Disposal Code.

discharge to ground or surface waters. 
 
2.2.1.2. A key component of conventional septic systems is the septic tank. The septic tank 
is the most common form of onsite wastewater pretreatment. The effluent from the tank 
typically flows to a leach field (Figure 2.2). The septic tank collects wastewater; segregate 
settleable and floatable solids (sludge and scum); accumulate, consolidate, and store solids; 
digest organic matter; and discharge treated effluent. 
 
Figure 2.2. Septic System with Leach Field. 
 
 
 
2.2.1.3. As illustrated in Figure 2.3, wastewater flows enter the septic tank and detained 
there long enough for heavier solids (sludge) to settle to the bottom while oils and greases 
(scum) float to the top. The leach field or soil adsorption system (SAS) distributes the tank 
effluent to the surrounding soils through a series of perforated pipes. The treatment process 
completes as the effluent percolates down through the soil on its way back into the 
groundwater. Manhole access at the locations shown allows periodic observation and

cleaning of the inlet/outlet tees. A newer feature commonly added on CONUS installations 
is an effluent filter in the outlet tee as shown. If used, place these filters directly in the effluent 
tee to protect the leach field from solids carried over from the septic tank. Maintainers can 
easily remove, clean, and reuse the filters. The filters are also suitable for protection of 
pressure-dosed systems. Effluent filters are available through industrial suppliers such as 
Grainger® and hardware stores and easily shipped. Effluent filters are available in various 
diameters for use in 4-inch to 8-inch pipes. 
 
Figure 2.3. Single Compartment Septic Tank. 
 
 
 
2.2.1.4. In addition to providing pretreatment for leach fields, septic tank pretreatment serves 
an important role in the success of other treatment alternatives, such as constructed wetlands, 
lagoons, sand filters, mounded systems, and packaged aerobic treatment systems. While 
septic tanks can achieve some separation of grease in the scum layer, place a properly 
designed grease trap upstream for all sewer flows generated from a kitchen or dining facility. 
An accumulation of grease in the septic tank could affect the quality of the effluent and clog 
the leach field. The configuration of the septic tank inlet tee directs sewage flow down into 
the clear zone without disturbing the scum layer. Likewise, the design of the effluent tee 
allows the liquid below the scum line to exit the tank to the distribution box (D-box) or 
pumping chamber. The biological process within the tank removes approximately 40 to 60 
percent of the influent solids; however, personnel will have to periodically remove and 
dispose of the scum and sludge that remains. 
 
2.2.2. Lagoon Systems. Lagoons (also known as ponds) usually consist of earthen basins with 
a liner made of natural or synthetic material. While there are many designs and terms used to 
categorize wastewater treatment lagoons and ponds, there are three basic types: aerobic, 
anaerobic, and facultative. These systems may have controlled discharge, continuous discharge, 
or no discharge. Some installations use lagoons alone or in combination with other treatment 
processes. Use of aeration equipment is sometimes an option to enhance the wastewater 
treatment process. 
 
14 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
2.2.2.1. A typical residential treatment lagoon system consists of both a septic tank for 
primary treatment and a lagoon (or pond) for additional treatment. When not preceded by a 
septic tank, the lagoon influent channel is typically equipped with a manually cleaned bar 
screen to keep rags and other floatables out of the lagoon. Some lagoons have chlorine 
contact chambers as part of the effluent structure, but this is normally not required if the 
lagoon has a detention time in the 50- to 60-day range. Controlled discharge lagoons 
commonly discharge only twice a year and produce excellent results with BOD, suspended 
solids removals in the 85 percent to 95 percent range, and fecal coliform reductions up to 99 
percent. Lagoon systems offer many advantages for small installations, especially if land is 
available and the location is isolated from inhabited areas. See Table 2.3 for common 
advantages and disadvantages of lagoon systems. 
 
Table 2.3. Lagoon Systems Advantages/Disadvantages. 
 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
Expensive equipment not required. 
Highly trained personnel not required. 
Economical to construct and operate.

applications.

Low or no energy requirements. 
Provides wildlife habitat. 
Few solids disposal problems. 
Mostly trouble-free when used correctly. 
May emit odors. 
Requires a large area of land. 
Seasonal climate changes may affect the quality 
of treatment. 
Can have suspended solids carryover in the 
effluent. 
Faulty construction may contaminate 
groundwater. 
May attract nuisance insects and/or pests. 
 
2.2.2.2. There are three types of wastewater treatment lagoons: aerobic, anaerobic, and 
facultative. The following paragraphs provides a brief overview of each type of lagoon 
system, however, more information for the commonly used facultative lagoon is provided in 
subsequent paragraphs. 
 
2.2.2.2.1. The aerobic lagoon is typically shallower than other types of lagoons to 
facilitate permeation of oxygen from the surrounding environment. As oxygen mixes with 
wastewater, aerobic bacteria and algae remove biological contaminants while larger 
solids settle to the bottom of the lagoon. Due to the shallow nature of these lagoons, 
engineers commonly pave or line them to prevent the growth of weeds and vegetation. 
Another common feature in aerobic lagoons are mechanical aerators. To enhance oxygen 
distribution through the flow depth of the lagoon, mechanical aerators or mixers create a 
turbid environment to increase the interface between the atmosphere and wastewater. The 
increase in aeration provided by the aerators can decrease the required retention by 
providing treatment that is more effective; however, offsetting this benefit is the increased 
costs for operation. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
15 
 
 
2.2.2.2.2. The anaerobic lagoon creates an environment that is oxygen deficient. This type 
of lagoon is most often the first step in treatment for farming, industrial, or commercial 
wastes. The anaerobic lagoon is deeper than other types of lagoons, ranging anywhere 
from 8 to 20 feet (2.4 to 6 m) deep. Similar to the inside of a septic tank, the wastewater 
settles into various layers: oils and greases on top, heavier solids on the bottom, with the 
flow undergoing treatment floating between the two. The grease and scum layer serves 
as a barrier to oxygen attempting to enter the system. As in septic tanks, personnel should 
periodically remove the bottom layer of sludge to maintain adequate storage in the lagoon. 
Although there is some treatment of wastewater by the bacteria and organisms that thrive 
in anaerobic conditions, the anaerobic lagoon is typically a pretreatment process and 
wastewater requires further treatment prior to discharge. 
 
2.2.2.2.3. The facultative lagoon is a common option for noncommercial sanitary 
wastewater treatment and has a simplified operational process. A typical system consists 
of a septic tank for primary treatment, a pond for secondary treatment, and either a leach 
field for final disinfection in groundwater discharge or other disinfection for surface water 
discharge (Figure 2.4). 
 
Figure 2.4. System Flow Diagram. 
 
 
 
2.2.3. Facultative Lagoons. The facultative lagoon is typically between 5 and 10 feet deep and 
settles into three distinct treatment layers: the aerobic zone on top, the facultative zone in the 
middle, and the anaerobic zone on the bottom (see Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6). Each of these 
zones provides a unique form of treatment, with help from bacteria, algae, and other organisms 
inhabiting the lagoon. 
 
2.2.3.1. The aerobic zone provides aerobic treatment by mixing with atmospheric oxygen 
and helps control odors released from the waste-treatment process. An algal layer forms at 
the top of the aerobic zone, taking in sunlight and carbon dioxide released from the 
wastewater treatment process and releasing oxygen back into the aerobic zone. 
 
2.2.3.2. The anaerobic zone breaks down settled solids with microorganisms that thrive in 
oxygen-depleted conditions. If correctly sized, the solids gathering in the anaerobic zone 
will not accumulate to where the lagoon needs cleaning out. 
 
16 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
2.2.3.3. The facultative zone contains a spectrum of aerobic to anaerobic conditions and any 
of a variety of treatment processes can occur in that region. The performance of a facultative 
lagoon is largely dependent on its surroundings: sunlight, wind and occasional rain provides 
for oxygen, photosynthesis of algae, and mild mixing of the top aerobic zone. Without the 
right conditions, treatment performance will decline, and the retention times needed to 
achieve adequate effluent quality will significantly increase. The treatment process is also 
highly temperature-dependent; thus, lagoons installed in locations with colder winter 
temperatures must be sized to contain all wastewater generated through the winter. When 
spring/summer temperatures return, the treatment process begins, and operators can 
discharge the winter effluent. Table 2.4 lists key selection factors for facultative lagoons, 
and Table 2.5 identifies the main advantages and disadvantages of facultative lagoons.

changes. 
 
2.2.4. Sand Filters. Sand filters are another method of secondary treatment of septic tank 
effluent (Figure 2.7). They provide secondary treatment in three ways; filtration, chemical 
sorption, and assimilation (Table 2.6). One of the oldest methods of wastewater treatment 
known, sand filtration, if properly designed, operated, and constructed, produces high quality 
effluents. During construction, engineers often bury sand filters partially or completely in the 
ground but may build them above the ground to avoid bedrock or a high water table. Open or 
18 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
subsurface sand filters are beds of granular materials, typically 24-36 inches deep and underlain 
by graded gravel and collecting tile or drainpipe. Some sand filter systems recirculate filter 
effluent through the filter using recirculation tanks. Wastewater treatment normally follows 
with disinfection (as required) prior to reuse or disposal to land or surface waters.  
 
2.2.4.1. Various types of sand filters include single-pass sand filters, bottomless sand filters, 
and recirculating sand filters. While single-pass and bottomless sand filters are briefly 
reviewed in this chapter, the primary focus is on recirculating sand filters. Key selection 
factors for sand filters include those listed in Table 2.7. Table 2.8 lists some advantages and 
disadvantages of sand filters. 
 
2.2.4.2. Bottomless sand filters provide for specific low-flow applications (less than 800 gpd 
[3,000 Lpd]) and where a shallow water table and/or unlimited site area is not available for 
a conventional leach field. Secondary pretreatment may also be required after the septic tank. 
 
2.2.4.3. Single-pass sand filters are also suitable for lower design flows and where nitrogen 
removal is not required. Single–pass sand filter designs may also be in a mound arrangement 
for direct discharge to the soil below. Note: Some kind of large particle separation may be 
required before effluent goes into sand filters. In this application, a separate area for leaching 
is not required. An example of this arrangement is in Technology Fact Sheet 10, Intermittent 
Sand/Media Filters, of EPA Manual 625/R-00/008.

2.2.4.4. The recirculating sand filter is a high-performance process that requires a pretreated 
effluent and more O&M attention than other small systems. A power source is necessary for 
pumping. The basic components of recirculating sand filters include a recirculation/dosing 
tank, pump and controls, distribution piping network, filter bed with underdrain system, and 
a gravity return line back to the tank for mixing with septic tank effluent before reapplication 
to the filter (Figure 2.8).

2.2.5. Natural Land Treatment Systems. Natural land treatment refers to the application of pre-
treated wastewater to the land at a controlled rate where physical, chemical, and biological 
processes treat the wastewater as it passes across or through the soil. Natural land treatment 
systems offer many advantages for small installations, especially if ample land is available and 
the location is isolated from inhabited areas. While there are several natural land treatment 
systems, principal methods include Rapid Infiltration and Overland Flow. 
 
2.2.5.1. Normally, natural treatment systems are simple to operate, produces a high-quality 
effluent, but require a large amount of land. There are several types of treatment systems in 
the natural treatment system family. They include slow rate infiltration, overland flow 
systems, irrigation systems, infiltration basins, and constructed wetlands. Designers must 
precede these natural treatment systems with either fine screens or primary sedimentation, 
or both because the systems are not capable of treating raw sewage without pretreatment by 
these additional processes. For that reason, natural treatment systems could be a viable 
choice to follow a lagoon or septic system in an area that requires a high-quality effluent due 
to local environmental sensitivity requirements. Table 2.9 lists the advantages and 
disadvantages of natural treatment systems.

when seasonal temperature variations slow 
or preclude treatment. 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
21 
 
 
2.2.5.2. The rapid infiltration process involves collecting wastewater into a shallow 
infiltration basin (or spreading basin) above highly permeable soils so it can percolate and 
receive treatment (Figure 2.9). This method can treat a large amount of wastewater on a 
smaller plot of land, and the system is not climate-dependent, allowing the system to function 
year-round. Unlike facultative lagoons, continuous operation negates the need for long-term 
storage of untreated waste, which reduces the overall size of the system. However, units 
typically install multiple basins to allow resting between applications, especially during wet 
seasons. Key selection factors for rapid infiltration systems include those listed in Table 
2.10. In addition, Table 2.11 lists the main advantages and disadvantages of rapid infiltration 
systems.

Less effective in heavy rain. 
Must have at least two operating basins. 
Requires more land than some other treatment 
methods. 
Soil clogging may generate odors. 
Infiltration cycles must be tracked and managed, 
including seasonal adjustments. 
 
2.2.5.3. The overland flow treatment dispenses wastewater down a gradual, mainly 
impervious, grass-covered slope where it collects at the bottom and discharges back into the 
hydrologic cycle (Figure 2.10). The process requires little pretreatment outside of primary 
settling; however, it is a secondary or advanced treatment process. Treatment takes place in 
the top layer of soil and the bacteria and algae in the grasses help break down dissolved 
organics. The grasses will consume some nutrients; however, overland flow provides a lower 
degree of treatment for phosphorous and suspended solids than rapid infiltration. 
 
Figure 2.10. Overland Flow Treatment. 
 
 
 
2.2.5.3.1. Siting overland flow systems can be a challenge as the ideal impervious site is 
not always available. Identify a functional site early in the design process to confirm 
availability. Table 2.12 lists key selection factors for overland flow treatment systems. 
Since these systems operate on a feed/dry cycle, at least two process trains are needed so 
one can be in use while the other rests (dries). This system is not a good choice in areas 
with high rainfall or extremely cold weather. It is also not appropriate in arid regions

lacking natural vegetation. The overland flow system is generally lower in cost and has 
the added benefit of retaining 40 percent to 80 percent of the effluent within the 
watershed. 
 
2.2.5.3.2. Consider selling grasses harvested from the flow slope as mulch or hay to offset 
costs. Another advantage of the overland flow system is its ability to run year-round; 
however, nitrogen removal reduces greatly in the winter. Table 2.13 lists other 
advantages and disadvantages.

2.2.6. Constructed Wetlands Treatment Systems. Using natural wetlands for wastewater 
treatment is not normally an option. However, it may be feasible to create and use constructed 
wetlands to emulate the benefits provided by natural wetlands. Typically, engineers design 
constructed wetlands treatment systems as a contained bed or channel filled with appropriate 
vegetation and uses it as a polishing treatment. These systems treat wastewater by passing it 
through the constructed wetlands. Engineers design the wetlands to recreate and enhance the 
natural physical, chemical, and biological processes specifically to treat municipal and 
industrial wastewater, and storm water runoff. Significant water quality improvements, 
including nutrient reduction is possible using this system. Constructed wetlands treatment is a 
cost-effective, low-maintenance treatment option that can continue in all but the coldest of 
climates. There is no sludge processing as treated bio solids can remain within the system. 
Unfortunately, constructed wetlands typically require large portions of land, and they will 
eventually become saturated with nutrients and other treatment byproducts. The performance 
of constructed wetlands depends upon a steady flow of debris-free wastewater. The treatment 
process is dependent upon vegetation growth, so the climate can affect its efficiency. While 
most vegetation can survive a freeze, treatment during colder times is not very effective and an 
alternate source of treatment or a storage method for influent is necessary. Key selection factors 
for constructed wetlands include those listed in Table 2.14. See Table 2.15 for the main 
advantages and disadvantages of constructed wetlands. There are two types of constructed 
wetlands used to treat wastewater: free water surface (FWS) and subsurface flow (SF) wetland 
treatment systems. 
 
2.2.6.1. FWS Treatment. The more commonly implemented systems are FWS, and occur 
mostly as marshes, but bogs and swamps are also used (Figure 2.11). The treatment process 
orients more around interaction with the vegetation. Water flows over the vegetation/soil to 
an outlet point. In some FWS, the water is disposed of via evapotranspiration and seepage 
into the wetland. The water surface in FWS systems is exposed to the atmosphere. As such, 
most FWS wetlands are accessible by humans and can be breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

2.2.6.2. SF Treatment. In a SF system, treatment takes place both on the surface of the media 
and in the roots of the vegetation growing in the media. Use a gravel-based media inside a 
lined or impervious channel. Marsh-like vegetation anchors itself in the media and operators 
raise the wastewater level to just below the top of the media. Keeping the water level below 
the top of the media is an effective method for preventing mosquitoes and provides a barrier 
against human contact with raw wastewater. Figure 2.12 depicts a SF wetland treatment.

2.2.7. Commercial Process Systems. For onsite wastewater management requiring advanced 
treatment beyond the conventional septic tank and leach field, many commercial systems offer 
an alternative to the recirculating sand filter design, considered the generic advanced treatment 
design. The popularity of these commercial systems is because for the same design flow, the 
process tanks typically require a smaller footprint than the recirculating sand filter design and 
tank installation can be below grade, which can be advantageous when space is at a premium. 
Legal, operational, or practical factors might limit selection of commercial system alternatives. 
These systems incorporate the advances made in municipal processes and apply them to a 
smaller-scale system. While most are simple adaptations, many include proprietary features and 
are trade name-protected 
 
2.2.7.1. Systems Availability. The following are some of the available commercial systems 
capable of meeting a discharge effluent limit of 30 mg/L TSS, 30 mg/L BOD, and 25 mg/L 
total nitrogen. Some reliably provide nitrogen reduction to below 10 mg/L where necessary, 
but often require soda ash for alkalinity adjustment and a carbon source for the denitrification 
conversion necessary to reach that low value. Fecal coliform removals can also be achieved 
with disinfection. 
 
2.2.7.1.1. Packed Bed Filter System. Packed bed filter systems are similar to recirculating 
sand filters. However, rather than sand, the system utilizes a lightweight textile media 
with a large surface area. The system can provide equivalent treatment to that of a sand 
filter loaded at rates of 25 to 50 gpd/ft2 (1,020 to 2,040 Lpd/m2). After flowing into the 
processing tank, sewage separates into scum, sludge, and liquid effluent. The effluent 
flows into the filter media pod where microorganisms growing on the synthetic textile 
sheets remove impurities. After passing through the tank and the packed bed filter, the 
effluent discharges to the leach field for further treatment prior to groundwater 
integration. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
27 
 
 
2.2.7.1.2. Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR). Some BNR systems utilize a submerged 
attached growth bioreactor that operates in batch mode. This type of unit has a deep bed 
sand filter designed for the removal of soluble organic matter, nitrogen, and suspended 
solids within a single reactor. In addition to the deep bed sand filters, the system also 
contains an anoxic/equalization tank that serves as a primary clarifier ahead of the 
bioreactor. This bioreactor is mixed but not aerated to encourage denitrification of the 
recycled flows from the reactor. Within the reactor, the sand media functions as a filter 
and provides the surface area for maintaining the attached growth biomass. Recycle 
pumps and air compressors maintain the desired aerobic and anoxic process conditions at 
various batch stages. 
 
2.2.7.1.3. Aerobic Nitrogen Reduction. Aerobic nitrogen reduction systems use the 
natural settling process that takes place before the wastewater moves into the activated 
sludge treatment module. Introducing oxygen facilitates mixing through the media 
channel. After cleansing by the microbes in the media channel, effluent typically 
discharges to a leach field for groundwater disposal. 
 
2.2.7.1.4. Biofilter Systems. The biofilter system includes a synthetic, absorbent filter 
medium configured as a free draining, attached-growth, biological trickling filter. The 
engineered filter medium creates an environment that encourages microbial attachment 
that simultaneously provides aerobic, anaerobic, and anoxic environments for biological 
treatment, without air compressors and their high-energy use. Biofilters are appropriate 
for cold regions. This effluent typically discharges to a leach field for groundwater 
disposal. 
 
2.2.7.1.5. Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) Systems. Recent technical innovation and 
significant membrane cost reductions have pushed MBRs to become an established 
process option to treat wastewater. The MBR process is also capable of enhanced 
wastewater treatment where effluent reuse may be a goal. The MBR process consists of 
a suspended growth biological reactor integrated with an ultrafiltration membrane system, 
using hollow fiber membranes. Essentially, the ultrafiltration system replaces the solids-
separation function of secondary clarifiers and sand filters in a conventional activated 
sludge system, producing a high-quality effluent, simplifying operation, and greatly 
reducing space requirements. 
 
2.2.7.1.6. Extended Aeration. The extended aeration process is one modification of the 
activated sludge process which provides biological treatment for the removal of 
biodegradable organic wastes under aerobic conditions. Air may be supplied by 
mechanical or diffused aeration to provide the oxygen required to sustain the aerobic 
biological process. Mixing provided by aeration or mechanical means maintains the 
microbial organisms in contact with the dissolved organics. Basically, the extended 
aeration process includes the following components: bar screen, aeration chamber, 
clarifier chamber, and recycling. The effluent can be disinfected and capable of meeting 
reuse quality. The extended aeration or aerobic bioreactor system is not a proprietary 
process; however, many manufacturers trademark their package system.

2.2.7.2. Package Plants. Small installations have several options available for wastewater 
treatment. They may utilize the wastewater systems of neighboring communities, when 
possible. If permitted, they may install soil absorption systems. If sufficient land area is 
available, they may construct stabilization ponds. However, if none of these options are 
available, several types of commercially available wastewater treatment package plants 
should meet their needs. The term "package" as applied to wastewater treatment plants 
usually means a compact, relatively simple to operate unit designed to give complete 
treatment to the wastewater from a small community. Figure 2.13 illustrates some 
aboveground and belowground package plants for wastewater treatment. 
 
Figure 2.13. Various Package Plants. 
 
 
 
2.2.7.2.1. Most package plants currently being used employ a modification of the 
activated sludge process. The conventional activated-sludge plant aerates settled 
wastewater and return activated sludge at a mixed-liquor suspended solids concentration 
of about 2000 milligrams per liter for about 6 hours. The activated sludge is then settled 
in a secondary settling tank. Return sludge amounting to about 25 percent of the influent 
flow is recycled ahead of the aeration tank. The remainder of the activated sludge is 
wasted. The modifications to the activated sludge process that are used for package plants 
are the extended aeration process and the contact stabilization process. 
 
2.2.7.2.2. These systems have potential advantages over some "natural" alternatives in 
that they can provide a high-quality effluent, and they are generally very land-efficient. 
Disadvantages include the need for close skilled operator supervision, high maintenance 
requirements, and high- power consumption compared to natural wastewater treatment 
systems. The key selection factors in Table 2.16 and additional advantages and 
disadvantages listed in Table 2.17 are generic to all package plants.

2.2.8. Disinfection. Disinfection is the inactivation of disease-causing organisms. Disinfection 
occurs after primary or secondary treatment by an onsite wastewater treatment system. There 
are several methods of disinfection, but two of the systems—ultraviolet (UV) and chlorine 
disinfection—are the most likely to be used with a simple onsite wastewater disposal system. 
The need for disinfection will depend on applicable requirements (e.g., international agreement, 
30 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
DoD, operational chain of command), proximity to environmentally sensitive areas and 
drinking water supplies, and type of discharge (groundwater vs. surface water). Generally, 
surface water discharge is more likely to require disinfection. Chemical disinfection is 
undesirable in instances where the chemical residual would harm beneficial microbes. For 
example, do not use chemical disinfection in conjunction with a septic tank and leach field. The 
residual chemical will harm the organisms responsible for treatment in the soil biomat. 
 
2.2.8.1. UV Disinfection. Generally, UV disinfection is more appropriate for commercial 
package wastewater treatment units due to its specific influent and O&M requirements. UV 
disinfection involves exposing wastewater to UV light. The UV light penetrates pathogenic 
organisms’ cells and breaks up their genetic material, making it impossible for them to 
reproduce or sustain life. Use UV disinfection only when designed to work with the 
preceding wastewater treatment system, e.g., a commercial package system specifically 
designed for UV disinfection. Table 2.18 list advantages and disadvantages of UV 
disinfection. 
 
Table 2.18. UV Disinfection Advantages/Disadvantages. 
 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
No danger of overdosing. 
No smell. 
Short contact time. 
Does not require hazardous material 
storage. 
Minimal space requirements. 
Relatively insensitive to temperature and 
pH (acidity or alkalinity) fluctuations. 
Will not cause any byproducts or residuals 
to be discharged to the environment. 
Higher energy requirements compared to 
chemical disinfection. 
Cannot be used when wastewater has high 
levels of suspended solids, turbidity, color, 
or soluble organics. 
Replacement parts may not be available in 
remote locations. 
Requires a higher level of design precision. 
Requires a relatively high level of operator 
skill. 
 
2.2.8.2. Chlorine Disinfection. Chlorination is commonly used because it can kill disease-
causing bacteria and control nuisance organisms such as iron-reducing bacteria, slime, and 
sulfate-reducing bacteria. Common chlorine-containing disinfection products include 
chlorine gas, hypochlorite solutions, and chlorine compounds in solid or liquid form. Liquid 
sodium hypochlorite and solid calcium hypochlorite tablets are the most common forms of 
chlorine used for small systems because they are less hazardous than chlorine gas. Of these, 
tablet (solid) chlorination is the most common option selected for small onsite wastewater 
disposal systems that require disinfection. Liquid bleach should also be considered as 
suitable for some locations. Table 2.19 list advantages and disadvantages of chlorine 
disinfection. 
 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
31 
 
 
Table 2.19. Chlorine Disinfection Advantages/Disadvantages. 
 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
Chlorine is reliable and effective against a 
wide spectrum of pathogenic organisms. 
Chlorine is more cost-effective than UV 
disinfection. 
Chlorine residual in wastewater effluent 
prolongs disinfection after initial treatment.  
Chlorine residual can be measured to 
evaluate effectiveness. 
Dosing rates are flexible and can be 
controlled easily. 
Chlorine is highly corrosive and toxic, special 
storage and handling required. 
Chlorine residuals are toxic to aquatic life, 
dechlorination may be necessary before surface 
discharge. 
Chlorine reacts with certain organic matter in 
wastewater, creating hazardous compounds.  
Wastewater with high BOD concentration may 
require higher chlorine doses for adequate 
disinfection, creating hazardous disinfectant by-
products such as harmful compounds and gases, 
and possible corrosive water. (consult with 
bioenvironmental engineers) 
 
2.2.8.2.1. Calcium hypochlorite is added by immersing chlorine tablets in the wastewater 
using a tablet chlorinator. As illustrated in Figure 2.14 and Figure 2.15, a typical calcium 
hypochlorite tablet chlorinator or tablet disinfection system usually include the items 
listed below. Wastewater flows through the contact basin and erodes the tablets at a 
predictable rate based on the amount of water flowing through the basin. An accurate 
chlorine dosage can be achieved by controlling the water flow rate through the 
chlorinator. 
 
• A PVC tube to dispense tablets, generally by gravity. 
• A contact chamber where the wastewater comes into contact with the tablets. 
• A storage reservoir where the disinfected water is retained before discharge. 
 
2.2.8.2.2. Disinfection with liquid bleach can range from sophisticated installations using 
metering pumps to simple, manual addition of the chemical. Where metering pumps are 
used, design the pump to withstand the corrosive effect of liquid bleach. Additionally, 
adjust the pump to meter the appropriate amount of the chemical based on flow; this may 
require flow meters with instrumentation and a control system. The system should be 
designed by a registered professional engineer. Manual bleach addition occurs only when 
no other resource is available. The operator may pour bleach into a wet well of wastewater 
and allow mixing and contact time. Generally, 15 minutes of contact with 0.2 mg/L of 
bleach is adequate for disinfection. The operator determines the concentration of liquid 
bleach for the volume of liquid, and meter out the appropriate amount to achieve 
disinfection. Take care when handling liquid bleach—it is corrosive and damaging to the 
skin and eyes. Additionally, its vapors are corrosive to metals; metal objects generally are 
not stored in the same room as liquid bleach. Recommend well ventilating liquid bleach 
storage areas. Since liquid bleach is more volatile and may present complex storage and 
handling requirements, the best option may be to use tablet chlorination/dechlorination, 
with very few exceptions.

2.2.9. Commercial Systems Selection and Purchase. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-240-
01, Wastewater Collection and Treatment, offers basic guidelines for selection of wastewater 
treatment processes. Treatment system selection and design should be determined by feasibility 
studies, considering all engineering, economic, energy, and environmental factors. Address 
special considerations for tropics/semiarid and cold/arctic locations outside the U.S. All 
legitimate alternatives should be identified and evaluated by life cycle cost analyses. As noted, 
there are several alternatives available for consideration. Use specifications prepared by 
AFCEC or its consultant for selecting materials and equipment for construction of each system 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
33 
 
 
as appropriate. Many systems are deliverable as a single package for installation with limited 
pre-construction; however, site preparation, including a leveling pad or foundation, is a 
minimum requirement. The manufacturer or supplier also provides guidelines for system 
installation and testing. Order specialty treatment equipment with all O&M manuals, including 
troubleshooting guides. 
 
2.2.9.1. Commercial treatment systems are typically proprietary systems purchased from a 
single supplier and delivered as a unit, which may require some assembly and site 
preparation prior to delivery. There is no common requirement for operating a proprietary 
system as each supplier has their own unique requirements. Commercial treatment systems 
come in several process types; some are designed to achieve advanced treatment for surface 
water discharge, whereas other systems are intended as an add-on to a conventional septic 
system intended for subsurface discharge of the final effluent. 
 
2.2.9.2. When working with consultants or designers, consider that these professionals are 
most comfortable with technologies they are familiar with already. For this reason, it is 
useful to get more than one estimate or opinion with written justification why their 
recommendations are the most appropriate for the site and unit needs. Each system type has 
its own merits. Evaluating different methods and manufacturers can be a daunting task even 
for experienced system designers. Selecting a package plant for use at a semi-permanent 
deployment location would likely be an option when the site is not well suited for more 
conventional treatment methods like septic systems or lagoons or if advanced treatment is 
required due to local conditions or regulations. The person charged with the task of selecting 
a technology and its fabricator needs to consider several factors, some include: 
 
• Discharge quality requirements 
• Site-related issues 
• Constructability 
• Purchase cost, including shipping 
• Installation and O&M costs 
• O&M frequency and staffing requirements 
• Power requirements and availability 
• Availability of operating supplies (e.g., lubricants, chemicals) 
 
2.2.9.3. The checklists in Table 2.20 through Table 2.24 outlines additional parameters to 
consider prior to selecting a commercial package plant and vendor. Lifecycle costs should 
be an important consideration. While some technologies may have a lower initial capital 
cost, they may also have a high O&M cost. Cost estimates also include electricity and the 
cost of spare parts over the lifecycle of the facility. See Table 2.24 for a sample evaluation 
of a lifecycle cost analysis. Comparing the total costs for all of the technologies under 
consideration, assuming a 20-year period multiplier for the annual O&M costs, should yield 
a true picture of the total cost of each system under consideration.

2.2.10. Cost Estimating. Planners responsible for estimating construction costs follow 
guidance in DAFI 32-1020, Planning and Programming Built Infrastructure Project, and 
AFI 32-1023, Designing and Constructing Military Construction Projects, when making 
cost estimates for supporting facilities, including wastewater treatment plants. Be sure to 
consider initial construction, overhead, and life-cycle costs for each alternative treatment 
system. Construction costs for onsite treatment systems at overseas contingency locations 
can vary widely depending on the treatment system selected. First, consider a conventional 
septic system for its simplicity and cost efficiencies. Consider alternatives only when site 
conditions or environmental factors warrant the additional expense and complexity. 
 
2.2.10.1. Depending on the location, it is likely that additional costs could be a factor at an 
overseas deployment location. The most likely factor in increased cost is the availability of 
materials and equipment and the need to transport these process elements to the site. 
Materials and simple equipment used in basic treatment systems should be available at many 
contingency locations, and many wastewater-related equipment and supply items are 
available worldwide. However, costs for many equipment items and specialty devices may 
vary significantly based on the location of the supply source, its proximity to the deployment 
site, and delivery to the deployment site. 
 
 
36 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
2.2.10.2. Additional costs associated with installation at a foreign deployment site are unique 
for each installation and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. When projecting a 
WWTF for an existing deployment site or a site with significant intelligence on local 
conditions and commercial access to equipment and supplies, it may be a good idea to do 
some pre-planning and cost estimating. However, it is difficult to prepare accurate cost 
estimates for a new deployment site until the following factors are considered. 
 
2.2.10.2.1. Availability and purchase cost of materials and process equipment: 
 
• Does the location have access to piping and concrete suppliers? 
• Can the site provide adequate materials for back-fill and grading? 
 
2.2.10.2.2. Delivered cost of materials and equipment to the deployment site: 
 
• Is delivery limited to air shipment? 
• Is weight and size of process equipment a limiting factor? 
 
2.2.10.2.3. Site preparation and utility requirements: 
 
• Is power required for pumping or process equipment? 
• Is water required for O&M of process equipment? 
 
2.2.10.2.4. Installation costs, including labor and equipment: 
 
• Is construction equipment available at the site? 
• Can a local contractor be hired for installation? 
 
2.2.10.2.5. Expertise required for installation and start-up: 
 
• Lower-complexity WWTF requires minimal expertise—likely by Air Force 
personnel. 
• Commercial systems require professional assistance—additional cost for services. 
 
2.2.10.2.6. Available personnel/operator qualified for WWTF O&M (for remote locations 
with commercial systems, recommend an onsite operator): 
 
• Commercial systems will require onsite qualified licensed operator. 
• On-line or web-based assistance may be available to the operator for additional 
troubleshooting. 
• On-line monitoring connection by a supplier is not likely available to military 
deployment sites. 
 
2.3. Site Screening Factors. The site-screening checklist at Table 2.25 lists initial planning factors 
to establish baseline conditions for deployment sites and identify potential limiting factors. The 
checklist can help evaluators identify limitations that may exclude certain alternatives and thus 
reduce the number of alternatives left for consideration.

Consider using the WWTF selection factors in Table 2.26 to help guide the selection process for 
a suitable, practical, and sustainable plan at each site. The following paragraphs and the WWTF 
Planning and Selection Matrix at Attachment 3, further addresses these selection factors. The 
matrix is a visual aid addressing recommended steps for developing a wastewater plan for a site 
based on available site information and guidance documents. It is usable throughout this 
publication as a systematic decision tree for the process of evaluating, screening, selecting, 
designing, and constructing a WWTF that meets the needs of the deployment site while 
considering many important factors.

2.5. Wastewater Flow and Characteristics. Wastewater characteristics vary throughout the 
world. For wastewater treatment process design, determining the flow rate and mass loading 
variations are important in sizing certain unit processes. An adequate determination of waste 
characteristics is best made from existing sampling data (if available) or based on a similar 
deployment site. In lieu of available data, make estimates based on water supply and consumption 
records. The physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of wastewater can also vary at each 
site based on several factors, including established habits of community personnel that cause 
hourly, daily, and weekly variations, seasonal conditions, and changes in water supply sources. 
 
2.5.1. Wastewater Estimates. Sanitary flows vary based on the source, water consumption, and 
site-specific conditions. As shown in Table 2.27, wastewater projections for deployed locations 
are significantly lower than typical U.S. locations where water supply is readily available, not 
typically restricted, and of consistently good quality.

2.5.1.1. As identified in AFPAM 10-219V5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning, an estimated 
19.7 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) (74.6 liters per capita per day [Lpcd]) of wastewater 
is generated from an average potable water supply of 30 gpcd using mobile water system 
assets. Where non-mobile (fixed water treatment plants) water assets are available, typical 
water consumption is 60 gpcd (227 Lpcd), which generates an estimated 42.7 gpcd (162 
Lpcd) of wastewater flow. 
 
2.5.1.2. In contrast to mobile water system assets, the typical U.S. wastewater flow values 
are an estimated 60 gpcd (227 Lpcd). The water use difference may also affect the relative 
wastewater characteristics with respect to pollutant loading and design adjustments may be 
necessary. 
 
2.5.2. Wastewater Characteristics. It is important to note that water resources are usually limited 
at contingency locations, and therefore units will take conservation measures to mitigate the 
shortages. These results in higher BOD loading rates per volume or flow compared to non-
contingency locations as shown in Table 2.28. Designing for the appropriate BOD loading rate 
and ambient temperature is key to achieving desired levels of treatment.

2.5.2.1. Another important concern to address is chemical wastes in wastewater. In general, 
the treatment alternatives listed in this publication are for biological wastes (e.g., human 
waste, hand wash-water). Disposing of chemicals in the wastewater treatment process will 
inhibit treatment and damage the process. The most notable chemicals are those used in 
portable toilets or chemical toilets. If these types of toilets are widely used, it is advisable to 
use commercial package plants designed to handle that type of waste. 
 
2.5.2.2. Unfortunately, there are no typical values for wastewater because it varies so much 
and depends on many factors. The summary of cited values in Table 2.28 above is based on 
a review of published data. From this starting point, estimated values reflect expected 
concentrations for two deployment site conditions: one where the water supply is limited to 
mobile sources; the other where the water supply is permanent, such as an onsite well or a 
connection to a nearby water supply. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
41 
 
 
2.5.3. Water Quality Standards Applicable to Stream or Surface Water Discharge. Units must 
review regulatory requirements mandated by international agreement, DoD policy, or 
combatant command (command authority) (COCOM)/operational chain of command when 
considering options and selecting the wastewater treatment design that best meets the needs of 
the site. In the U.S., individual states impose stringent limits for nitrogen and phosphorus to 
limit nutrient loading on local streams and harbors. The same concerns may exist at a 
contingency location and units may have to consider the potential use of a surface water 
discharge at their deployment site. Typically, units do not pursue surface water and/or stream 
discharges for onsite systems; instead, groundwater recharge is encouraged through leach field 
effluent disposal. In situations where a leach field is not possible or feasible, pretreatment before 
discharging to surface waters would require one of the advanced treatment methods addressed 
in Chapter 3, with an additional requirement for disinfection. Another alternative to consider 
would be a non-discharging lagoon system, depending on the size of the deployment site and 
population generating the wastewater. 
 
2.5.4. Water Quality Standards Applicable to Subsurface/Groundwater Discharge. The focus of 
this publication is for WWTFs intended to serve contingency locations staffed with 30 to 250 
personnel. For this size facility, the estimated flow ranges from less than 1,000 gpd (3,790 Lpd) 
up to 10,000 gpd (37,850 Lpd), for a site with non-mobile water supplies and much lower design 
flows for sites served with mobile water supplies. In this range, onsite systems with 
groundwater discharge are often the most simple, expedient, long-term management plan. 
However, always review MAJCOM or CCMD guidance for specific requirements onsite 
WWTF systems. 
 
2.5.4.1. Studies have shown that conventional septic treatment and leaching systems achieve 
high removal rates for most pollutants of concern. Soil filtration through the biomat 
effectively removes biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, fecal coliform, and 
ammonia nitrogen. The aerobic subsoil and high temperatures also reduces viruses and 
effectively treats toxic organics. However, nitrate generated from ammonia conversion is 
highly soluble and passes through to the groundwater. Because of their solubility, chlorides 
also pass through to the groundwater. 
 
2.5.4.2. Table 2.29 presents the recommended effluent water quality under various site 
conditions, including protective zones for water supply wells or other nitrogen-sensitive 
areas. In general, the estimated water quality at the point where the leach field effluent meets 
the groundwater typically includes 50 mg/L BOD, 50 mg/L TSS, and 45 mg/L total nitrogen. 
As shown in Table 2.30, the conventional septic system meets these limits for lower flows. 
Where additional nitrogen reduction requires denitrification to meet sensitive groundwater 
conditions, consider advanced treatment such as a recirculating sand filter or a commercially 
available alternative treatment system described elsewhere in this publication. These 
systems can reliably produce an effluent quality of 30 mg/L BOD and TSS, 25 mg/L total 
nitrogen to the leach field and are typically required for facilities treating higher wastewater 
flows, as indicated.

2.5.5. Characteristics of Receiving Site. Initially assess receiving site characteristics by 
performing a physical survey or reports from local representatives. Consider the climate, size 
of the site, physical features and restrictions, and security when reviewing alternatives. In 
addition, the personnel population, both initially and long-term for the deployment, may be a 
factor. Site requirements with respect to expected term for the deployment location, funding 
limitations for construction, and/or long-term O&M costs will be important factors in selecting 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
43 
 
 
an alternative. All these factors are critical to selecting a successful wastewater plan that 
addresses the needs of the deployment location in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. 
The WWTF Planning and Selection Matrix in Attachment 3 identifies and qualifies key factors 
to consider that will facilitate a decision on the most appropriate system for a specific site. 
Consider the treatment alternatives described in previous sections of this chapter. 
 
2.6. Site Evaluations. When reviewing WWTF alternatives for a particular location, evaluators 
often proceed in three phases, a preliminary review of documented site information, a 
reconnaissance of potential sites (preliminary site survey), and a detailed evaluation of the priority 
site or sites. Using this phased approach can help focus site evaluation efforts on only the most 
promising sites. The scale and detail of the evaluation depends on the anticipated amount of flow 
and quality of wastewater to be treated, the nature of local soils, the hydrogeological setting, and 
number of available sites, among other factors. 
 
2.6.1. Review Documented Site Information. Evaluators usually conduct a preliminary review 
before performing fieldwork or site testing. The preliminary review examines key criteria, 
including climate, topography, geology, soil surveys, wastewater characteristics, surface water 
and groundwater risk factors, and general site conditions. The information may lack accuracy 
but is useful in identifying problems or features to investigate. Further, the preliminary review 
can help identify potential receiver sites, determine the most feasible receiving environments, 
identify potential design boundaries, and assist in developing a relative suitability ranking. 
More than one receiving environment might be feasible and available for use. Focusing the 
effort on the most promising receiving environments and receiver sites allows the evaluator to 
eliminate the least suitable sites early in the site evaluation process. For example, basic 
knowledge of the local climate might eliminate evaporation or evapotranspiration as a potential 
receiving environment immediately. While certain conditions may be beyond predictability, the 
preliminary review phase should provide an overview of key site conditions that help evaluators 
compare the feasibility of one alternative over another for a specific site or location. 
 
2.6.1.1. Climate. Climate can affect the performance of certain wastewater treatment system 
alternatives, and extreme climate conditions will likely prohibit or reduce the available 
options for a specific site. Sites with extreme cold and/or permafrost conditions limit and 
challenge belowground construction of wastewater management facilities. Elsewhere, 
seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation usually will not be prohibitive for most 
alternatives. Other extreme conditions such as high temperatures, continuous heavy 
precipitation, or desert conditions must also be considered during design, but are also likely 
not prohibitive. The climate of a deployment location will influence site conditions, 
including soil and groundwater and surface water characteristics. 
 
2.6.1.2. Topography and Geology. Consider site topography in siting sanitary and dining 
facility sources of wastewater with respect to the intended sites for treatment and disposal 
sites for the collected wastewater. Where possible, gravity flow will minimize the need for 
pumping equipment and simplify design and operations. Geology will directly affect the 
constructability of a wastewater treatment system and preferred location. Surface water 
features and water supply well locations will require protection from contamination and thus 
impose additional siting limitations. 
 
44 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
2.6.1.3. Soil Survey Data. Contemporary soil survey data usually consists of a collection of 
reports, maps, images, and geographic information system data, indicating the type, 
description, distribution, and interpretation of potential uses of soils in a particular area or 
region. Soil survey data for an existing deployment site may be available from onsite 
personnel or local community records. For a new deployment location, consider obtaining 
general soils data through the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC). 
ISRIC is an independent foundation responsible for collecting, archiving, and distributing 
data and research information. Typically, soil surveys rely on deductive projections of soil 
units based on topographical or landscape position and evaluators should regard it as general 
in nature. The accuracy of soil survey maps decreases as assessments move from the 
landscape scale to the site scale. This information is useful as background and an indication 
of potential future problems; however, onsite testing is necessary to specifically identify the 
soil type and determine the suitability of a specific site. See paragraph 2.6.2.2 for 
preliminary soil investigations and paragraph 2.6.3 for detailed site evaluations. 
 
2.6.1.4. Wastewater Characterization. Having an accurate characterization of the anticipated 
wastewater stream is critical when assessing the level of wastewater treatment and disposal 
for contingency locations. Specifically, evaluators consider the characterization of 
wastewater from water-using activities, including daily volumes, rates of flow, and quality 
(i.e., pollutant load). Where applicable, review beddown planning factors for anticipated 
wastewater characteristics at contingency locations. Consider the type of plumbing fixtures 
and appliances, their extent and frequency of use, and any other factors influencing 
wastewater flow and quality. Also, be sure to consider any short- or long-term variations to 
daily wastewater volume and flow that will affect the size of system components. Once 
evaluators know the characteristics of the anticipated wastewater, they should consider the 
potential treatment and disposal options available. 
 
2.6.1.5. Wastewater Disposal. Since site characteristics constrain the method of disposal 
more than other components, evaluators should address the disposal component first. To 
determine the disposal method properly, a detailed site evaluation is required. Since it is not 
economical nor practical to evaluate a site for every conceivable system design, begin by 
eliminating disposal options with the least potential so the detailed site evaluation 
concentrates on the most promising options. Evaluate disposal options based on 
characterization (i.e., flow and quality) of the wastewater to be treated and disposed. For 
contingency locations, the method of disposal is usually via subsurface soil absorption, 
evaporation, or discharge into surface waters. 
 
2.6.2. Reconnaissance Survey. Evaluators use the reconnaissance survey to obtain preliminary 
site data to help determine the appropriate receiving environment, screen potential receiver 
sites, and further focus the detailed site evaluation. The survey typically includes visual checks 
of each potential site, preliminary soils investigations using hand borings, and potential system 
layouts. Information gathered from the preliminary review, soil sampling tools, and other 
materials should be on hand during the reconnaissance survey. Begin the reconnaissance survey 
with a site walkover to observe and identify existing conditions, select areas to perform soil 
borings, or view potential routes for piping or outfall structures. The site evaluator should have 
an estimate of the total area needed for the receiver site based on wastewater characterization, 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
45 
 
 
including average daily flow (ADF) and anticipated soil characteristics from the preliminary 
review. 
 
2.6.2.1. Visual Survey. Used to identify general features that might affect site suitability or 
system layout and design. General features that should be noted include the following: 
 
2.6.2.1.1. Landscape Position. Landscape position and landform determines surface and 
subsurface drainage patterns that can affect treatment and infiltration system location. 
Landscape features that retain or concentrate subsurface flows, such as swales, 
depressions, or floodplains, should be avoided. Preferred landscape positions are convex 
slopes, flat areas with deep, permeable soils, and other sites that promote wastewater 
infiltration and dispersion through unsaturated soils. Use landscape positions when 
determining the locations for soil investigations. 
 
• The underlying bedrock often controls landscapes, which are modified by a 
variety of natural forces. Ridgelines are narrow areas that typically have limited 
soil depth but often a good potential for surface/subsurface drainage. 
• Shoulderslopes and backslopes are convex slopes where erosion is common. 
These areas often have good drainage, but the soil mantle is typically thin and 
exposed bedrock outcrops are common. Sideslopes are often steep, and erosion is 
active. 
• Footslopes and depressions are concave areas of soil accumulation; however, 
depressions usually have poor drainage. The deeper, better-drained soils are found 
on ridgelines, lower sideslopes, and footslopes. Bottomlands might have deeper 
soils but might also have poor subsurface drainage. 
 
2.6.2.1.2. Topography. Long, planar slopes or plateaus provide greater flexibility in 
design than ridges, knolls, or other mounded or steeply sloping sites. This is an important 
consideration in gravity-flow treatment systems, collection piping for cluster systems, 
treatment unit sites, and potential routes for point discharge outfalls. 
 
2.6.2.1.3. Vegetation. Existing vegetation type and size provide information regarding 
soil depth and internal soil drainage, which are important considerations in the subsurface 
wastewater infiltration system layout. 
 
2.6.2.1.4. Natural and Cultural Features. Surface waters, wetlands, areas of potential 
flooding, rock outcrops, wells, roads, buildings, buried utilities, underground storage 
tanks, property lines, and other features should be noted because they will affect the 
suitability of the receiver site. 
 
2.6.2.2. Preliminary Soil Investigations. Select areas for soil investigation based on the 
desired location and your experience and knowledge of the landscape position, local soil 
formation factors, and geologic conditions. Consider using preliminary soil borings to 
examine potential sites unless subsurface wastewater infiltration as a treatment or dispersal 
option has been ruled out for other reasons. Shallow borings, typically to a depth of at least 
5 feet should be made with a soil probe or hand auger to observe the texture, structure, 
46 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
horizon thickness, moisture content, color, bulk density, and spatial variability of the soil. 
Excavated test pits are not typically required during this phase, however they are often used 
during detailed site evaluations (paragraph 2.6.3) to produce comprehensive soil profiles. 
See Attachment 4 for field-expedient soil testing methods that can aid in the preliminary 
identification and classification of soils. 
 
2.6.2.3. Potential System Layouts. The final step of the reconnaissance survey is to make a 
preliminary layout of the proposed system on each remaining candidate site based on 
assessed site characteristics and projected wastewater flows. This step is necessary to 
determine whether the site has sufficient area and to identify where detailed soils 
investigations should be performed or concentrated. In practice, this step becomes integrated 
into the field reconnaissance process, so the conceptual design unfolds progressively as it is 
adapted to the growing body of site and soil information. Typically, placement of the WWTF 
depends on the site features (Table 2.31) and planned developments at the location. Consider 
using geographic and geospatial information, aerial photographs, topographic terrain maps, 
visual surveys, and other available data. Note: A detailed site evaluation is needed to confirm 
the selected location can work from a more comprehensive design perspective and is key to 
providing a successful onsite WWTF in the most suitable location.

2.6.2.3.1. Illustrated in Figure 2.16 is an example arrangement of a deployed site layout 
for a conventional septic system sized to treat up to 3,000 gallons per day (gpd) (11,360 
liters per day [Lpd]) of wastewater. This arrangement assumes that the soil characteristics 
will support a leach field and provides the smallest footprint while considering the 
following: 
 
• Adequate offset between water supply well and other features. 
• Gravity sewer piping to carry flows away from sources. 
• Location of septic tank away from housing and kitchen facilities to reduce odors. 
• Location of leach field away from vehicle traffic. 
• Adequate offset between surface water and wastewater facilities (see paragraph 
2.6.4.3).

2.6.2.3.3. For conventional (leaching systems) and lagoon systems, the recommended 
Do’s and Don’ts for site management and use protects the long-term viability of the water 
and wastewater facilities at the site. Consider the recommendations in Table 2.32. If the 
recommended distances in the table are not available onsite, consider moving or 
modifying the arrangement, alternate locations, or using different wastewater treatment 
and disposal options, i.e., packaged treatment systems, surface water discharge, 
nondischarge wastewater systems, or host nation (HN) off-site WWTFs and systems. Be 
sure to consult with the Engineering Flight and Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) when 
considering alternatives for wastewater treatment and disposal.

Table 2.32. WWTF Location Recommendations. 
 
Recommendations 
Maintain water supply offsets to potential contaminant sources: 
 
Locate sewer pipes, latrines, and tanks at least 300 feet from the public water supply well. 
 
Locate the leach field at least 400 feet from the well. 
 
Locate fuel storage at least 400 feet from the well. 
Protect the sewer system and leaching area from damage: 
 
Do not park or drive vehicles over treatment system areas. 
 
Establish vehicle access outside these areas. 
 
Do not dig or construct within 10 feet of the leach field. 
 
Consider only raised platforms over leach field for tent placement. 
 
Do not plant trees in the sewer or leach field areas. 
 
Consider grass or shallow ground cover over field to prevent erosion. 
 
Do not drive over shallow sewer piping. 
 
Bury sewer piping at least 3 feet deep if crossing a travelled way (Note: Greater depths 
may be needed depending upon type of backfill, pipe material, and compaction specified. 
Considerations for lagoons: 
 
Maintain 100-foot buffer between toe of berms to surface waters. 
 
Avoid constructing lagoons in potential floodplain zones. 
 
Locate downwind and away from lodging and kitchen areas. 
 
Locate at least 400 feet away from water supplies. 
 
2.6.3. Detailed Site Evaluation. The objective of the detailed evaluation is to evaluate and 
document site conditions and characteristics in sufficient detail to allow interpretation and use 
by others in designing, siting, and installing the WWTF. Address surface features such as 
topography, drainage, vegetation, site improvements, property boundaries, and other significant 
features identified during the reconnaissance survey. In addition, address subsurface features 
such as soil characteristics, depth to bedrock and ground water, subsurface drainage, presence 
of rock in the subsoil, and identification of hydraulic and treatment boundaries. Convey this 
information using standardized nomenclature for soil descriptions and hydrological conditions, 
such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D2487, Standard Practice for 
Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes (Unified Soil Classification System), or other 
applicable standards. Excavation pits, soil borings, soil permeability measurements, ground 
water characterizations, and pilot infiltration testing may be necessary for large subsurface 
infiltration systems. For evapotranspiration systems, field measurements of pan evaporation 
rates or other parameters, as appropriate, might be necessary. Because detailed site evaluations 
can be extensive, they should not be performed unless the preliminary and reconnaissance 
evaluations indicate a high probability that the site is suitable. At a minimum, the detailed 
investigation should include soil profile descriptions and topographic mapping. Specific site 
evaluation information may include the surface and subsurface features listed in Table 2.33.

Standard Practice for Subsurface Site Characterization of Test Pits for On-Site Septic 
Systems, which is summarized in Table 2.34, might be useful when describing soil profiles 
in the field. Depending on composition, soil can treat organic materials, inorganic 
substances, and pathogens in wastewater by acting as a filter, exchanger, adsorber, and a 
surface on which many chemical and biochemical processes may occur. The combination of 
these processes acting on the wastewater as it passes through the soil produces a water of 
acceptable quality for discharge into the groundwater under the proper conditions.

2.6.3.1.1. Much of the treatment provided by the soil may be by the physical entrapment 
of particulate matter in the wastewater. This process performs best when the soil is 
unsaturated. If saturated soil conditions prevail, the wastewater flows through the larger 
pores and receives minimal treatment. However, if the soil remains unsaturated by 
restricting the wastewater flow into the soil, filtration improves because the wastewater 
then flows through the smaller pores of the soil. The soil depth needed to remove bacteria 
and viruses to acceptable levels and nearly all the phosphorus, depends on the 
permeability of the soil. Soils with rapid permeability may require greater unsaturated 
depths below the infiltrative surface than soils with slow permeability.

2.6.3.1.2. While a nearly infinite variety of substances may exist in soils, their basic 
components are minerals, organic matter, air, and water. The groups of mineral particles 
separated on the basis of a range in size (soil separates) are sand, silt, and clay. Air and 
water may exist in the pores between solid soil particles. Collectively, sand, silt, and clay 
refers to the fine earth fraction of soil, all of which are less than 2 millimeters (mm) (0.08 
inch) in diameter and range, as noted in Figure 2.18. 
 
Figure 2.18. Soil Separates and Size Ranges. 
 
 
 
2.6.3.1.3. The percentage by weight of each mineral affects the permeability of the soil 
and thus the ability of the soil to absorb and drain water. Figure 2.19 identifies soil 
textures based on the percentage of separates (sand, silt, and clay). Soils are divided into 
drainage classes related to the frequency and duration of saturation during soil formation. 
Soil texture can be used to estimate the percolation rate, which is used to estimate the size 
of the onsite treatment area. The following is a general description for each soil textural 
class based on the soil classification used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
Table 2.35 describes the feeling and appearance of the various soil textures for a general 
soil classification. 
 
2.6.3.1.4. Ideal conditions for septic systems and their respective leaching areas include 
sandy, well-draining soils with limited silt and clay. Where clay soils are prevalent, 
consider a lagoon system for post-septic tank treatment in lieu of a leach field. 
 
2.6.3.1.5. One of the identifying characteristics of wetlands is the presence of hydric, or 
wet, soils. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) defines hydric 
soils as "soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding or ponding long 
enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part." 
These soils do not drain well and are not appropriate for septic systems. Avoid wetland 
areas to reduce potential contamination of local groundwater.

2.6.3.1.6. In Figure 2.20, historic high groundwater elevation appears to be only 3 to 4 
inches below the ground surface. This site is not advisable for a septic system. If installed, 
a mounded leach field would be necessary to accomplish a 2- to 4-foot offset to the high 
groundwater level shown. 
 
2.6.3.1.7. Mottling above observed groundwater is an indication of a zone that was 
periodically saturated (sometimes seasonal) and may impede drainage under a leach field. 
Well-drained soil is often brown or red, while poorly drained soil is gray. The gray colors 
result from many cycles of soil saturation (Figure 2.21).

2.6.3.2. Subsurface Soil Evaluations. As part of detailed site evaluations, soil borings, 
observation pits, and soil percolation tests can help determine subsurface soil features for 
areas proposed for a wastewater effluent leach field or lagoon. Refer to Figure 2.22 for a 
soil testing plan example. This plan shows the general locations for performing soil 
investigations, including borings, observation pits, and percolation tests. If the conditions 
are previously established or found to be consistent throughout the site, consider reducing 
the testing protocol. For all testing, document and maintain at the site, a detailed plan with 
locations and notes on the conditions. The data will be useful during system design and 
future modifications (if necessary) for repair or expansion. 
 
2.6.3.3. Soil Borings. Soil borings may be feasible if the equipment and expertise is readily 
available at the site. Soil borings can help determine the soil texture and depth to the 
groundwater table or ledge. Consider boring study for proposed wastewater system area to: 
 
• Assess general soil conditions. 
• Locate ledge or boulders that may hinder construction. 
• Locate water table, if encountered. 
• Identify other problem conditions. 
• Identify the most appropriate location for the leaching area (consider preliminary soil 
investigation and slope of site). 
 
2.6.3.4. Observation Pits. In contrast to soil borings, most sites will have an excavator and 
experienced operator readily available to dig observation pits. Also, observation pits provide 
access for a more detailed analysis of the soil conditions than soil borings. However, it might 
not be possible to identify all design boundaries, such as the permanent water table surface 
or bedrock if they are beyond the depth of the observation pit. In addition to providing 
detailed soil characterizations, observation pits can help determine: 
 
 
56 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
• Presence of groundwater in the area and/or mottling point, if observed. 
• Presence of rocks or boulders in the immediate area. 
• Presence of clay or other hindering soil features. 
• Consistency of the materials in the area. 
• Soil horizon relationships. 
• Approximate bottom of leach field required to maintain adequate distance to the 
groundwater.

AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
57 
 
 
2.6.3.4.1. Dig observation pits based on the system size. Excavate pit up to 10 feet deep 
(or to refusal) in the lowest part of the test area of the proposed leaching area to check 
soil texture and determine mottling or groundwater elevation. Recommended pervious 
material below a leaching area is 3 to 4 feet minimum. 
 
2.6.3.4.2. In the example shown in Figure 2.23, the excavation ran into groundwater at 9 
feet below site grade. Pending favorable percolation rates in subsequent analyses, 
construct the proposed leach field with a bottom elevation of 6 feet below grade or above. 
If the excavation encounters seasonally saturated soil or an impervious layer (rock or 
clay) at a depth of 3 feet or closer to the ground surface, the area may not be appropriate 
for a subsurface leaching system. However, consider a mounded leaching system if other 
factors are suitable. 
 
Figure 2.23. Example Observation Pit for Leaching Area. 
 
 
 
2.6.3.5. Percolation Test. The percolation test is designed to determine the suitability of a 
site for a subsurface discharge (to absorb liquid) and thus simulate the conditions in a septic 
system. The steps listed in Table 2.36 and illustrated in Figure 2.24, addresses procedures 
for performing a percolation test. Perform the test at the bottom elevation of proposed leach 
fields. Dig percolation test holes and conduct tests in the intended leach field area to: 
 
• Measure percolation rate(s) throughout the area. 
• Establish percolation rate to use for design conditions. 
• Verify the location and bottom elevation of the leach field.

AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
Table 2.36. Percolation Test Procedures. 
 
Day 1 or Early Same-Day Preparation: 
Step 1 Identify the proposed leaching area and expected depth. 
Step 2 Dig four to six test holes 6 to 8 inches in diameter and 24 inches deep that are 30 to 
40 feet apart in the area (and intended depth) of the proposed leach field. 
Step 3 Roughen walls of test holes to remove any smears caused by the digging process and 
remove all loose soil from the bottom of the holes. 
Step 4 Place gravel in the bottom to prevent soil erosion. 
Step 5 Dig a 4-foot deep test pit in the lowest part of the test area leaching area to check soil 
texture. This will not be filled with water and is used to monitor groundwater during 
the percolation test. No percolation test holes should be within 3 feet of the pit. 
Step 6 Presoak: Fill each of the test holes with water and refill to maintain a minimum depth 
of 12 inches for at least 4 hours. A 6-inch-diameter hole requires about 1.5 gallons 
per foot of depth. 
Step 7 Prepare a measurement stake with nails or other markers located at specific intervals 
that can be easily observed. Refer to Figure 2.24. 
Day 2 – Testing 
Step 1 Prior to testing, clear bottoms of test holes of any loose soils or debris. 
Step 2 If no water remains in the hole after the overnight soak period, add 6 inches of water 
above the gravel. 
Step 3 Fill the test holes to a specific marker elevation (typically 12 to 18 inches) above the 
bottom of the test hole and note the exact time. 
Step 4 Measure the drop in water elevation after a set time-period or the time required to 
drop to the next marker. 
Step 5 After each measurement, re-fill the hole to a minimum depth of 6 inches above the 
bottom gravel. 
Step 6 Calculate the percolation rate in minutes per inch of elevation drop. 
Step 7 Continue taking measurements until three consecutive percolation rates vary by no 
more than 10 percent. 
Step 8 Refer to Table 2.37 for the loading rates relative to percolation and soil textural class 
to determine the effluent loading rate on the leaching area. 
 
2.6.3.5.1. In very sandy soils, a stopwatch may be required to measure the time in seconds 
for the water level to drop 1 inch (2.5 cm). Consider timing the drop over several inches 
to check quick- draining soils. If percolation rates exceed 60 minutes per inch (2.5 cm), 
the soils may not be suitable for leaching. See Table 2.38 for soil textural class with 
associated descriptions and comparisons of the hydraulic loading in gpd/sf (cm/day) for 
two different effluent qualities: 
 
• Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) = 150 mg/L, which corresponds to typical 
septic tank effluent. 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
59 
 
 
• BOD = 30 mg/L, which corresponds to more advanced treatment provided by a 
recirculating sand filter or commercial treatment process described in paragraphs 
2.2.4 and 2.2.7, respectively.

2.6.4. Groundwater and Surface Water Features. The environmental conditions, including the 
groundwater and surface water features provide important information needed to size, select, 
and site the appropriate wastewater treatment system. 
 
2.6.4.1. Water Table or Saturated Zone Elevation. Groundwater protection is critical for 
maintaining environmental health. The location of the water table or saturated zone is an 
important factor in locating onsite leaching systems. Soil characteristics under the leaching 
area provide additional treatment for the septic tank effluent before it reaches the water table. 
The treatment zones, as shown in Figure 2.25, generally include: 
 
• Infiltration zone: About 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick directly under the leaching area is the 
most biologically active zone and is called the biomat; the biomat is the layer of 
biological growth and inorganic residue under a leach field that develops at the 
wastewater-soil interface and extends up to about 1 inch into the soil matrix. 
• Vadose (unsaturated) zone: Located below the biomat where nitrification occurs if 
sufficient oxygen is present in the soil. 
• Saturated zone: Here the treated wastewater is transported from the site with the 
laminar flow of groundwater. 
 
2.6.4.1.1. Most U.S. state health codes require minimum separation distances of at least 
18 inches (46 cm) from the seasonally high water table or saturation zone to the bottom 
of the leach field, regardless of soil characteristics. In general, 2- to 4-foot separation 
distances have proven to be adequate to remove most fecal coliform from septic tank 
effluent through the soil zones. 
 
2.6.4.1.2. Where high groundwater conditions exist and a mounded leaching system are 
considered, additional design factors include: 
 
• Increasing the surface (loading area) of the leach field. 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
61 
 
 
• Improving pre-treatment to the field. 
• Adding dosing field cell(s) to allow cycled dosing. 
 
Figure 2.25. Groundwater Zones. 
 
 
 
2.6.4.2. Hydraulic Loading Limitations. Use the soil texture classification (sand, silt, and 
clay proportions) determined from the site excavation, and the percolation rate measured in 
the field, to define the conditions for long-term hydraulic loading. Where unsuitable silt and 
clay conditions exist, the limited hydraulic loading may eliminate onsite treatment from 
consideration. Where leaching systems are not usable, consider a lagoon system as an 
alternative if adequate land is available onsite. 
 
2.6.4.3. Groundwater and Surface Water Protection. To minimize the potential impact from 
onsite treatment systems on nearby groundwater drinking water wells, wetlands, and surface 
water bodies such as ponds and streams, the setback distances below are recommended. 
These distances are intended only as a guide. Safe distance varies from site to site, based 
upon topography, soil permeability, groundwater gradients, geology, etc. 
 
• 400-foot (122 m) minimum setback from drinking water supply source. 
• 100-foot (30.5 m) minimum setback from leach field or lagoon to tributary stream. 
• 50-foot (15 m) minimum setback from septic tank to surface water. 
• 100-foot (30.5 m) minimum setback from leach field to surface water (not used for 
drinking water). 
 
2.6.5. Floodplains. Construction on floodplains is not advisable due to the potential for damage 
to the onsite systems and related risk of pollutant contamination. Where possible, consider a 
mounded leach field and/or surface-located pre-treatment system beyond the floodplain area. 
Make sure all tanks and piping are watertight and tested to avoid contaminating the 
groundwater.

TREATMENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND ALTERNATIVES 
 
3.1. General Information. Onsite wastewater treatment systems vary in design and performance, 
and depending upon site conditions and circumstances, each has its own unique advantages and 
disadvantages. In general, wastewater treatment systems should be designed to transform raw 
wastewater into an effluent suited to the disposal component or method. For example, in a 
subsurface soil absorption system, the pretreatment unit (e.g., septic tank) should remove nearly 
all settleable solids and floatable grease and scum so that a reasonably clear liquid is discharged 
into the soil absorption field. This allows the field to operate more efficiently. Likewise, for a 
surface discharge system, the treatment unit should produce an effluent that will meet applicable 
surface discharge standards. The wastewater treatment designs and alternatives addressed in this 
chapter may or may not be practical or otherwise allowed at a particular location because of legal, 
operational, or practical (e.g., natural terrain) factors. Refer to MAJCOM or Combatant Command 
guidance for specific requirements. 
 
3.2. Design Review, Construction Inspection, and Monitoring. A successful project depends on 
proper design, construction, and operation to ensure long-term service and reliability of the 
wastewater treatment system installed at a deployed location. Review and documentation of these 
project elements is important for ongoing maintenance as well as for future reference if we need 
to address a problem or changed condition. The following guides and checklist provide basic 
design, construction, and monitoring information for WWTFs, and personnel may use and modify 
them as needed for a specific project. 
 
3.2.1. Design Review Guide. At a minimum, take the steps in Table 3.1 when conducting a 
design review. Completion of the review items below are critical to ensuring the design will be 
capable of handling the flow. Completing a proper design review will help to minimize 
confusion during the construction phase. After design completion, it is ready for construction.

3.3. Septic Tank Systems. Septic tanks are a key component used in most conventional onsite 
treatment and collection alternatives and provides pretreatment of wastewater prior to discharge 
to leach fields. Septic tanks work because the design allows stratification within the tank, thus 
separating scum and sludge from the clear zone. The baffles help direct and slow the flow through 
the tank, which allows the sludge to settle and scum to remain on the surface. The key factors in 
design are: 
 
• Average daily flow (ADF): The flow volume processed by the plant on a typical day. 
• Velocity through the tank. 
• Reserve capacity. 
• Solids storage capacity. 
• Hydraulic retention time. 
• Recommended length to width ratio is 3:1. 
• Clear zone volume is 1.5 to 2 times the daily design flow. 
• Reserve sludge volume requires an additional 3-foot (0.9 m) reserve in tank bottom. 
• Minimum of 1-foot (0.3 m) surface is recommended for venting and scum accumulation. 
• Single-compartment septic tanks are adequate for single-unit applications and lower 
design flows. 
• For flows over 750 gpd (2,840 Lpd), a two-compartment tank is recommended for 
improved reliability and performance. 
 
3.3.1. Septic Tank Design. The following is a step-by-step guide to designing a dual-chamber 
septic tank: 
 
3.3.1.1. Determine the ADF for the facility. Engineers base the ADF on the number of 
personnel and water use. Refer to Table 2.27 for expected flows. 
 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
65 
 
 
3.3.1.2. Determine total storage volume required for each chamber as shown below. In a 
dual-chamber septic tank, the first chamber into which sewage flows has a detention time of 
48 hours. The second chamber has a detention time of 24 hours. Detention time (DT) is the 
length of time required for one complete volume change. 
 
V (gallons) = ADF gpd x detention time (days). 
 
3.3.1.3. Convert storage volume from gallons to cubic feet as shown below. 
 
V (ft3) = V (gallons) ÷ 7.48 gallons per cubic foot. 
 
3.3.1.4. Determine interior dimensions of both chambers as shown below. The total available 
volume of the tank (Vavail) is equal to or greater than the volume calculated for the required 
detention times. 
 
• The first chamber represents two-thirds of the volume. 
• The second chamber represents one-third of the volume. 
 
L1 = W 
L2 = 2 x L1 
H = 6 feet to 16 feet (max) 
Vavail (ft3) = (L1 x W x H) + (L2 x W x H) 
 
3.3.1.5. Establish maximum allowable sludge accumulation. The sludge should not 
accumulate to more than 3 feet (0.9 m) or 25 percent to 35 percent of the first chamber. 
 
3.3.2.6. Determine working volume as shown below. The working volume is amount of

the outlet flow tee.

3.3.1.7. Pipe sizing and location (refer to Figure 3.1). 
 
• Influent pipe should be equal to the gravity sewer pipe at least 21 inches (0.5 m) 
below grade. 
• Connection pipe between chambers should be 6 to 8 inches (152 to 203 mm) in 
diameter at same elevation as effluent pipe. 
• Effluent pipe should be minimum 6 inches (152 mm) in diameter and located 3 inches 
(76 mm) minimum below influent invert. 
 
3.3.1.8. Effluent filter locations. 
 
• Connection tee – To protect second chamber (or pump chamber). 
• Effluent tee – To protect leach field (or separate pump station).

3.3.1.11. Provide anti-flotation collar. Recommend an anti-flotation collar to counteract 
buoyancy when high groundwater may be an issue. Typically, a 6-inch (15 cm) collar is 
adequate for most situations, as shown in Figure 3.1. The extended base provides additional 
weight and bearing area for the soil pressure.

Refer to Figure 3.1 for dimensions key for this table 
 
3.3.1.12. Provided in Table 3.4 is a detailed design calculation for a 3,000-gpd system. It 
lists recommended design and dimensions for septic tanks with certain design flows. Figure 
3.1 shows the recommended installation for a concrete septic tank designed to serve a flow 
of 3,000 gpd (11,360 Lpd). Note that the inlet and outlet tees are set with an elevation 
differential to draw flow through the tank.

AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
3.3.1.13. Septic tanks must be watertight. Typically, they are made of reinforced concrete as 
shown in Figure 3.1. Steel tanks are not widely used because they require corrosive-resistant 
coatings and cathodic protection. Fiberglass and polyethylene-molded tanks are also 
available, but they must have anti-buoyancy provisions for belowground installation. If 
concrete tanks are not local-manufacture and shipping is required, consider polyethylene 
tanks for ease and cost of delivery, but availability may be limited in the larger tank sizes. If 
choosing polyethylene tanks, consider separating the wastewater flows into two separate 
treatment trains to reduce the tank sizing requirements. 
 
Table 3.4. Septic Tank Design Example. 
 
Septic Tank Design 
Problem: Given a site with a staff of 75 and served by an onsite well: 
Solution:  
ADF = 75 staff x 40 gpcd (from Table 2.27) = 3,000 gpd  
ADF = design flow (Q) = 3,000 gpd 
Total storage volume (V) = detention time (DT) x Q 
V = 2 days x 3,000 gpd + 1 day x 3,000 gpd 
V = 9,000 gallons  
V ≈ 1,200 ft3 
Interior height (H) = 12 ft. (refer to Table 3.3)  
Therefore required area = 100 ft2 
L2 = 2 x L1  
L1 = W 
Therefore, L2 = 2 x W 
100 ft2 = [(2 x W) x W] + [(W x W)] 
100 ft2= 2W2 + W2 
100 ft2 = 3W2  
W2 = 33.33 ft2 
W = 5.77 ft 
Round to 6-ft standard length from Table 3.3  
W = 6 ft 
If W = 6 ft then: 
L1 = 6 ft 
L2 = 12 ft 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
69 
 
 
Septic Tank Design 
Verify that given these dimensions there is sufficient working volume (Vw). 
Vw = (H – sludge depth – depth from bottom of cover to invert of effluent pipe) x L2 x W  
Vw = (12 ft – 3 ft – 1.25 ft) x 12 ft x 6 ft 
Vw = 612 ft3 
Vw ≈ 4,600 gallons 
4,600 gallons > 1.5 x ADF, so OK. 
Summary of Design: 
Tank dimensions:  
H = 12 ft 
L1 = 6 ft  
L2 = 12 ft 
W = 6 ft 
 
3.3.2. Leach Field Design. There are several options for effluent disposal following the septic 
tank, including leach pits, trenches, beds, and chambers. There are also commercial systems 
that units can install after the septic tank, such as a modified trickling filter with clarifier to 
reduce the size of the leach field for locations with limited space. Leach pits are less favored 
due to their vertical orientation and limited treatment capability. Leach trenches and beds each 
utilize polyvinyl chloride (PVC) distribution piping in a planned design arrangement that is 
simple to install and allows a soil treatment layer between the bottom of the field and the 
groundwater. The difference between trenches and beds relates to the slope and method of 
installation. Consider leach chambers in lieu of former alternatives where the leach field may 
be located in a travelled way or reducing the leach field profile. Leach chambers made from 
concrete or high-density polyethylene plastic are commercially available. 
 
3.3.2.1. Leach trenches and beds, also referred to as leach fields, are the most common 
methods for disposing of septic tank effluent. Sometimes called drain-fields, subsurface 
absorption systems (SAS), or subsurface wastewater infiltration systems, they are an integral 
part of the system design to achieve the following objectives of the soil treatment process: 
 
• Stabilization of organic wastes in the effluent. 
• Removal of pathogenic organisms, nutrients, and particulates. 
• Recharge of the groundwater table with adequately treated effluent. 
• Effluent disposal without discharge to ground surface or creation of any nuisance. 
 
3.3.2.2. The design features that are most capable of achieving the objectives above include: 
 
• Moderate organic loading from septic tank. 
70 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
• Shallow placement of the leaching surface (< 2 feet [61 cm] below grade) to assure 
soil aeration. 
• Narrow trenches (< 3 feet [1 m] wide). 
• Trench orientation parallel to surface contours. 
• Uniform distribution over the leach field for maximum performance. 
• Multiple cells (fields) for alternating; provides resting between dosing and standby 
capacity for service periods. 
 
3.3.2.3. Commonly, septic tank effluent distribution is by gravity to the leaching 
arrangement through a concrete distribution box for systems sized up to 2,000 gallons (7,570 
L) per day. In Figure 3.2, the operator is inspecting the distribution box to check gravity 
flow distribution to multiple headers. Operators can adjust inlet weir inserts at each 
distribution pipe to maintain even distribution. 
 
Figure 3.2. Distribution Box. 
 
 
 
3.3.2.4. Non-pressure dosing alternatives without electricity include a siphon bell utilizing 
an air vent for release, float-controlled using a mechanical float for release or alternating 
dosing flow to multiple compartments, and tipping buckets or pan system that functions on 
a balance principle. In general, these alternatives are for low-flow septic systems but are an 
alternative where power for a pressurized pump-dosed system is not possible or practical. 
 
3.3.2.5. In larger systems, pressure distribution of the leach field is advisable to maintain 
consistent loading rates throughout the field. A pressure system requires a two-compartment 
septic tank (or a separate pumping chamber) and the tank effluent is pumped to the leach 
field to maintain a minimum pressure at the furthest point of the field. The pump is activated 
based on set levels in the tank (or time intervals) and thus delivers periodic cycles of flow or 
doses. Dosing provides intervals between field loading to rest the field and is preferred in 
most applications because of its consistent distribution and long-term treatment reliability.

71 
 
 
3.3.2.6. Figure 3.3 shows a typical lateral pipe installed in a trench prior to backfilling. Note 
the granular pipe bedding material under the lateral. The pressure dose releases from orifice 
openings in the lateral located at 5-foot (1.5 m) spacing. An orifice shield (Figure 3.4) serves 
to protect the orifice, allows the discharge to spray and encourages even distribution 
throughout the leach field. Orifice shields are used in a pressurized distribution system to 
prevent surrounding media from blocking orifices. Constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
orifice shields snap-fit onto laterals. Orifice shields (and orifices) can be installed facing up 
or down (cold weather applications), the latter being shown in Figure 3.3. Refer to Figure 
3.5 through Figure 3.8 for more details on piping and field arrangements. For the leach field 
arrangement shown in Figure 3.8, a non-electric rotating cam (center) is used to alternate 
effluent dosing to four separate leaching areas. This allows rest between cycles for optimal 
performance and reliability.

3.3.2.7. Loading Rates – Leach Field Sizing. Generally, the design hydraulic loading rates 
for leaching systems are based on a typical BOD loading from a septic tank of 150 mg/L, 
the soil texture classification determined during the site excavation, groundwater elevation, 
and the percolation rate measured in the field. See paragraph 2.6.3.5 and Table 2.37 for 
information on percolation rate and soil textural class as identified in the site evaluation 
description. In Table 2.37, adjusted loading rates account for the long-term acceptance rate 
of the leach field. The long-term acceptance rate is limited in part by the texture of the soil 
layers under the field and the formation of a biomat based on the strength of effluent applied 
to the soil. Where engineers expect significant increased BOD strength, the loading rate may 
need adjustment. For this comparison, consult Table 2.38. The following paragraph presents 
an example that outlines the design process.

AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
3.3.2.8. Leach Field Design Example. Given a site with a staff of 75 and non-mobile water 
assets, size a leach field to follow a septic tank. Installation shall be in a fine, sandy loam 
(Class II soil) with a percolation rate of 30 minutes/inch. 
 
3.3.2.8.1. Refer to Table 2.37 to determine the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) based on 
soil classification and percolation test. 
 
HLR (perc) = 0.33 gpd/sf 
 
3.3.2.8.2. If the percolation test is not available, refer to Table 2.38 to compare HLR 
based on the BOD concentration expected for septic tank effluent at 150 mg/L. Make 
adjustments if necessary. 
 
HLR (BOD) = 0.2–0.4 gpd/sf. 
 
3.3.2.8.3. Use HLR (perc) = 0.33 gpd/sf because assumed BOD level = 150 mg/L and 
HLR (perc) is within the range noted above. 
 
3.3.2.8.4. Determine average daily flow (ADF): 
 
75 staff x 40 gpcd (from Table 2.27) = 3,000 gpd 
 
3.3.2.8.5. Calculate required leaching area = ADF ÷ HLR 
 
Area = 3,000 gpd ÷ 0.33 gpd/sf  
Area = 9090 sf; use 10,000 sf 
 
3.3.2.8.6. Determine minimum leaching area using a length:width ratio of 1.5:1. Note: 
Recommend dividing leaching area into four equal zones to minimize dose volume and 
allow for partial replacement if damage occurs to a section of the leach field. For this 
example, operators will dose the four zones two at a time (each pair off a dedicated force 
main). 
 
Area = 1.5 W x W  
10,000 sf = 1.5 W2 
6,666 sf = W2 
W = 82 ft., L = 123 ft. 
 
3.3.2.8.7. Determine leaching area piping layout using four zones to minimize each dose 
volume and thus reduce the size of the pump required. Minimum area for each zone = 1/4 
(10,000); or each with dimensions 41 ft x 61.5 ft. To keep lateral length within 40 feet 
and simplify spacing: 
 
Four zones, each: 40 ft. W x 66 ft. L 
 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023

3.3.2.8.8. Calculate number and size of the laterals required for effluent distribution in 
each zone: 
 
Lateral spacing = 6 ft. on center; 11 laterals required per zone 
Orifice openings are 0.25 inch and spaced at 5 ft. (staggered), eight per lateral 
 
3.3.2.8.9. Total area required for this system includes 10-foot grading buffer around 
perimeter, 6- foot spacing between zones along the length, and 10-foot spacing for 
installing two parallel distribution header lines to the zones, as shown in Figure 3.5.

3.4. Lagoon Systems. Generally, the design and sizing of facultative lagoons is based on the 
retention time required for adequate BOD removal. Adequate surface area is also required so 
wastewater can interface with atmospheric oxygen. Lagoons can be almost any shape; however, 
in the rectangular formation the length usually does not exceed three times the width. Table 3.6 
summarizes the surface areas and dimensions of ponds for various flow conditions. 
 
3.4.1. Sizing. Specific steps for sizing facultative lagoons are addressed below: 
 
3.4.1.1. Determine the average air temperature in the region where unit is installing the 
lagoon. 
 
3.4.1.2. Based on the average air temperature, select an areal loading rate and the total 
treatment time from Table 3.6. 
 
3.4.1.3. Based on Table 2.27; determine the flow rate into the lagoon.

3.4.1.4. Calculate the BOD loading into the lagoon by multiplying the flow rate by the BOD 
concentration. If the BOD concentration is unknown, use 200 mg/L as a standard value. 
 
3.4.1.5. Based on the BOD loading and the areal loading rate, determine the required surface 
area of the lagoon using the following equation: 
 
 
Surface area =
BOD loading
Areal loading rate 
 
3.4.1.6. Determine the dimensions for the surface area of the lagoon. Lagoons can range 
from square to rectangular; however, the length usually does not exceed three times the width 
for a rectangular lagoon. 
 
3.4.1.7. Based on the flow rate and total treatment time; calculate the total volume required 
for the lagoon. 
 
Total volume = flow rate × total treatment time 
 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
77 
 
 
3.4.1.8. Based on the required total volume and the surface area, calculate the depth of the 
lagoon. 
 
Depth = total volume ÷ surface area 
 
3.4.1.9. Calculate the total area required for the lagoon by adding additional area for berms, 
fences, etc. Table 3.7 shows an example calculation. 
 
Table 3.7. Example Total Area Calculation. 
 
Known: 
Average air temperature = 0–15 °C (59 °F)  
Flow rate = 3,000 gpd = 11,356.24 Lpd 
Example Calculation: 
Areal loading rate = 22 kg/ha/d 
Total required retention time = 150 days 
BOD loading = 11,356.24 Lpd x 200 mg/L x (1 kg ÷ 1,000,000 mg) = 2.27 kg/day  
Surface area = (2.27 kg/day ÷ 22 kg/[ha/day]) x (10,000 m2 ÷ 1 ha) = 1,032 m2  
Length = 3 x width 
Surface area = length x width = 3 x width2 
Width = (surface area)1/2 ÷ (3)1/2 = (1,032 m2)1/2 ÷ (3)1/2 = 18.6 m  
Length = 3 x 18.6 m = 55.8 m 
Total volume = (1 m3 ÷ 1,000 L) x 11,356.24 Lpd x 150 days = 1,703 m3  
Depth = 1,703 m3 ÷ 1,032 m2 = 1.65 m 
Final Lagoon Dimensions: 
Length = 55.8 m 
Width = 18.6 m 
Depth = 1.65 m 
 
 
 
 
 
3.4.2. Selecting Type and Discharge Arrangement. There are various discharge types for 
facultative lagoons. A continuously discharging lagoon maintains the level of wastewater in the 
lagoon by discharging at the same rate it is receiving influent flow. In this situation, the most 
78 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
direct flow path must be adequate in length for treatment to occur. A complete retention lagoon 
(or evaporation lagoon) never releases flow from the containment area, but instead relies on 
evaporation and percolation to discharge at a rate higher than the influent rate to maintain a 
constant volume. Engineers usually size the controlled discharge lagoon to only discharge once 
or twice a year. In colder temperatures, a facultative lagoon’s treatment process slows or ceases 
completely. In a controlled discharging lagoon, the untreated winter flows remain in the lagoon 
until warmer temperatures return and treatment occurs. 
 
3.4.3. Lining Requirements. Lagoon liner alternatives include compacted clay in locations 
where low permeable soil conditions are compatible. Where soils are too permeable, consider 
installing synthetic liners such as laminated rubber, polyethylene, or PVC with a minimum 
thickness of 30 mils (0.03 inch) over a cushioning layer. Concrete liners are another alternative 
to consider if anticipating O&M issues. Sites suitable for unlined lagoons must have soils with 
percolation rates of 120 minutes/inch (47 min/cm) or less. Where soils are too permeable, a 
synthetic liner may be used. The liner needs to be at least 30-mil (0.03 inch) -thick and is 
typically made of laminated rubber compounds. Installation may require the services of a 
professional liner contractor, although homeowner-installable liners are available. To install 
such a liner, complete the soil-shaping portion of the lagoon then lay down a layer of sand or 
geotextile fabric to protect the liner from rock punctures when applying it over the cushioning 
layer. Depending on the manufacturer, seams in the liner may be hot-fused or overlapped; and 
consider anchoring the ends of the liner material in a trench dug in the top of the berms around 
the perimeter of the lagoon. Not all lagoons require seams; manufacturers sell sheets in sizes as 
large as 40,000 ft2 (3,700 m2). If PVC is used, cover the liner with 12 inches (30.5 cm) of soil 
to prevent photodegradation. The inside dikes should not exceed a 3:1 slope to prevent slumping 
of the soil. 
 
3.4.4. Construction Guidelines. When locating a site for the treatment lagoon, it is important to 
maintain certain setback distances from clean water sources. See Chapter 2 for specific siting, 
location, and separation guidance. 
 
3.4.4.1. Build the berms in 4- to 6-inch (10 to 15 cm) lifts of moist soil, taking time to 
compact each layer of soil before adding the next. To ensure an adequate seal in the clay 
liner on the lagoon bottom, it is important to destroy the original soil structure by repeated 
compaction and/or disking with rubber-tired equipment, such as a wheel tractor or a 
sheepsfoot roller. A 12-inch (30.5 cm) total thickness of compacted clayey soil on the bottom 
and up the inside slopes of the lagoon will generally provide an adequate seal. 
 
3.4.4.2. Liners must be leak-tested at the time of installation. Ensure the bottom of liner is at 
least 3 feet (1 m) above the highest seasonal ground water level. In wet areas, this may 
preclude excavation and require the construction of elevated berms to contain the lagoons. 
For lagoons bermed above the surrounding ground level, build with an overflow culvert or 
spillway at the top of the berm to ensure against washout. In addition, keep water from 
surface drainage or storm runoff out of lagoons. Sometimes it is necessary to install diversion 
terraces or drains at the site. See Figure 3.9 and Figure 3.10 for a component overview and 
profile for facultative lagoons.

3.4.4.3. No starter bacteria or other additives are necessary to put a new lagoon into use. 
However, it is desirable to have the excavated area fully saturated and the lagoon prefilled 
with enough water for solids to stay in suspension. During wet weather, consider prefilling 
the lagoon by temporarily diverting runoff from a roof or footing drain into the lagoon. 
During drier weather, consider prefilling the lagoon by pumping water from a facility water 
well or nearby pond. Do not allow the lagoon's compacted earthen liner to dry out. After this 
initial prefill, the lagoon will gradually fill by the incoming effluent. For additional

3.5. Recirculating Sand Filters. Engineers employ these filters as secondary treatment methods 
to polish effluents from septic tanks or aerobic treatment processes. Operators intermittently apply 
wastewater to the surface of the bed through distribution pipes or troughs. Recirculating sand filters 
require only one-fifth of the land area as single-pass or intermittent sand filters and therefore have 
a wider application where nitrogen-removal treatment is a requirement. The increased hydraulic 
recycle rate improves process control and reduces odors. Recirculating sand filters are aerobic, 
fixed-film bioreactors and considered the generic equivalent of proprietary treatment systems now 
available on the commercial market. BOD and TSS removals are generally 70 to 80 percent and 
effluent values of less than 30 mg/L are common. Ammonia removal is by nitrification, and the 
recirculating allows nitrate removal for an overall reduction of total nitrogen by over 50 percent.

3.5.1. Design Characteristics and Specifications. Filter media characteristics determine the 
required filter area, dose volumes, and dosing frequency. Consider the available media before 
completing the detailed design of the system. There are detailed specifications in EPA-625/R-
00/008, but, in general, select sand or gravel that is washed, durable, and rounded, with fine 
particles passing U.S. No. 200 sieve and limited to 3 percent by weight (Figure 3.11). Other 
alternative types of media may be an option, including crushed glass, anthracite, garnet, plastic, 
open-cell foam, expanded shale, or expanded clay. 
 
Figure 3.11. Sand Filter Media. 
 
 
 
3.5.1.1. Consider recirculating sand filters when a deployment site has an onsite water supply 
well and recommended distances between the well and leach field is not maintainable. 
Another reason for considering recirculating sand filters is to improve effluent quality to 
allow a reduced leach field area or to accommodate shallow groundwater conditions. In these 
cases, effluent disinfection prior to discharge may also be considered. Table 3.9 provides a 
summary of typical design specifications for recirculating sand filters.

3.5.1.2. As shown in Figure 3.12, the basic components of recirculating filters include a 
recirculation/dosing tank, pump and controls, distribution piping network, filter bed with 
underdrain system, and a gravity return line back to the tank where mixing with the septic 
tank effluent occurs before being reapplied to the filter. 
 
3.5.1.3. Filter dosing is on low volume cycles (typically two to three times per hour). 
Recirculation ratios are typically between 3:1 and 5:1. Time-cycled doses, typically 48 times 
per day, allow the media to rest between loadings for more effective treatment. Calculate the 
dose volume as follows: 
 
Dose volume (gal) = design flow (gpd) x (recirculation ratio +1)/number of doses per day 
 
3.5.1.4. The proposed arrangement includes a recirculation/dosing tank and dual train sand 
filters with underdrain return. Following this system would be a leach field for final 
discharge as shown in Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.6. Refer to paragraph 3.5.2 for recirculating 
sand filter system design explanation and procedures, and Table 3.10 for an example of 
design calculations for a recirculating sand filter.

3.5.2. Design Procedures. 
 
3.5.2.1. Determine the average daily flow (ADF) and the design flow (Q) for the facility. 
The ADF is the amount of wastewater to be treated daily and may be estimated using Table 
2.27. 
 
(Q = ADF) 
 
3.5.2.2. Determine hydraulic loading rate (HLR). The HLR ranges from 3 to 5 gallons per 
day per square foot (gpd/ft2), dependent on the media type. For coarse sand like that found 
in recirculating sand filters, use 3 gpd/ft2. 
 
HLR = 3 gpd/ft2 for coarse sand 
 
3.5.2.3. Determine the area required (A). 
 
A (ft2) = ADF/HLR 
 
 
84 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
3.5.2.4. Determine tank dimensions (L x W). Two parallel basins are recommended to allow 
alternating dosing. Each basin provides one-half the required area. For each, the length (L) 
is 1.5 times the width (W), but not greater than 50 feet. 
 
L = 1.5 x W (ft) or 50 ft, whichever is less A (ft2) = L (ft) x W (ft) x number of basins 
 
3.5.2.5. Determine the recirculation ratio (RR) required. RR is the total flow through the 
recirculating sand filter compared to the design flow. In general, the RR is between 3:1 and 
5:1. The higher RR is recommended for a conservative design since higher loading 
concentrations are expected. 
 
RR = 5:1 
 
3.5.2.6. Determine the influent flow (Qi). 
 
Qi = ADF x (RR +1) 
 
3.5.2.7. Determine doses per day. For a typical design, the number of pump cycles would be 
four to eight cycles per hour or every 7.5 to 15 minutes. Use 15-minute intervals to preserve 
the life of the pump. 
 
Doses per day = 15 minutes x (1 hour ÷ 60 minutes) x (1 day ÷ 24 hours) 
Doses per day = 96 
 
3.5.2.8. Determine dose volume. 
 
Dose volume (gallons) = Qi ÷ (doses per day) 
 
3.5.2.9. Determine the number of laterals required. A lateral is a perforated pipe used for the 
even distribution of flow over an area. The number of laterals required is based on the 
dimensions of the recirculating sand filter being installed. Laterals shall be spaced 2 feet on 
center (o.c.) along the width (W) of the recirculating sand filter. 
 
Number of laterals per basin = (width – 2 feet) ÷ 2 feet 
 
3.5.2.10. Lateral size. Laterals shall be made using a 0.75-inch-diameter pipe. Laterals shall 
extend from the influent to 1 foot from the opposite wall. 
 
Lateral diameter = 0.75 inch Lateral length = L - 1 foot 
 
3.5.2.11. Orifice size. The laterals shall be perforated with 0.25-inch-diameter orifices. 
 
Orifice diameter = 0.25 inch 
 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
85 
 
 
3.5.2.12. Orifice spacing. 
 
Orifice spacing = 2 feet o.c. 
Orifice spacing = 1 foot o.c. at lateral ends 
 
3.5.2.13. Flow through orifice. 
 
Orifice flow ≤ 2 gallons per dose (recommended maximum) 
 
3.5.2.14. Determine number of orifices required. 
 
Number of orifices = dose volume ÷ orifice flow 
 
3.5.2.15. Determine number of orifices per lateral. The orifices are spaced 2 feet o.c.; 
therefore, the number of orifices is equal to the length of the lateral minus 2 feet divided by 
2 feet. 
 
Orifice per lateral = (length of lateral – 2 feet) ÷ 2 feet. 
 
3.5.2.16. Determine total number of orifices. 
 
Orifice total = orifice per lateral x number of laterals per basin x the number of basins 
 
3.5.2.17. Recirculation pump runtime (Tp). Each recirculation pump shall be designed to 
operate for five minutes per pump cycle. See paragraph 3.9.4.1 for information on sizing 
the recirculation pump. 
 
Tp = 5 minutes x doses per day ÷ number of pumps 
 
3.5.2.18. Determine flow rate per dose. To determine the flow per dose, divide the influent 
flow (Qi) by the total pump runtime (Tp). 
 
Flow per dose (gpm) = Qi ÷ Tp 
 
3.5.2.19. Determine flow rate per orifice. The flow per 0.25-inch orifice does not exceed 
0.43 gpm. If the flow per orifice is less than or equal to 0.43 gpm, then the design is complete. 
If the flow per orifice is greater than 0.43 gpm, additional orifices are required, and the 
surface area of the recirculating sand filter basin will need to be increased. 
 
Flow per orifice = flow per dose ÷ orifice total

Table 3.10. Recirculating Sand Filter Design Calculations Example. 
 
Recirculating Sand Filter Design Calculations 
Problem: Given a site with a staff of 75 and non-mobile water assets, design a two-basin 
recirculating sand filter. Recirculation pumps will cycle on and off four times per hour and 
will run for five minutes upon startup. Given the site conditions and the guidelines provided 
here on locating septic systems, the maximum width for the recirculating sand filter that the 
site can accommodate is 20 feet. Assume a recirculation ratio of 5:1 based on location. 
Solution: 
ADF = 75 staff x 40 gpcd (from Table 2.27) = 3,000 gallons per day (gpd)  
Design flow (Q) = ADF = 3,000 gpd 
Q= 3,000 gpd 
HLR (coarse sand) = 3 gpd/ft2  
A = Q/HLR 
A= 3,000 gpd ÷ 3 gpd/ft2 = 1,000 ft2  
A = 1,000 ft2 
Two basins; therefore, the area of each basin is: 1/2 A = 500 ft2  
A = L x W 
500 = L x W 
Where: W = 20 feet 
Solve for L 
L = 25 feet 
Dimensions of basin: 20 feet x 25 feet 
Total amount of flow (Qi): 
Qi(gpd) = Q(gpd) x (RR + 1)  
Qi = 3,000 gpd x 6 
Qi = 18,000 gpd  
Number of doses per day: 
(24 hours/day) x (4 doses/hour) = 96 doses/day 
Dose volume (VD): 
VD = (18,000 gpd) ÷ (96 doses/day)  
VD = 188 gallons/dose 
Number of laterals per basis = (W – 2) ÷ 2 
(20 feet – 2 feet) ÷ 2 
Required laterals per basin = 9 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
87 
 
 
Recirculating Sand Filter Design Calculations 
 
Number of orifices = VD ÷ 2 gallons per orifice 
Number of orifices = 188 gallons ÷ (2 gallons/orifice)  
Number of orifices = 94 
Number of orifices per lateral = (L - 1) ÷ 2 
Orifices = (25 feet – 1 foot) ÷ 2 feet  
Orifices per lateral = 12 
Total number of orifices per basin = 12 orifices/lateral x 9 laterals  
Total number of orifices per basin = 108  
Two basins ∴ = 216 orifices  
216 orifices are > 94, so this is satisfactory  
Total runtime per day per recirculation pump (TP) = 5 minutes x (96 doses/day ÷ 2 pumps)  
TP = 240 minutes/day  
Flow per dose provide by the pumps = Qi ÷ (2 x TP)  
Flow per dose = (18,000 gpd) ÷ (480 minutes/day)  
Flow per dose = 75 gpm  
Flow per orifice = flow per dose ÷ total number of orifices  
75 gpm ÷ 216 orifices  
Flow per orifice = 0.35 gpm  
0.35 gpm ≤ 0.43 gpm (acceptable)  
Summary of Design:  
Provide two basins that are each 20 feet x 25 feet.  
Each basin shall be equipped with nine 0.75-inch laterals located 2 feet o.c.  
Each lateral shall have 106 0.25-inch orifice openings located 2 feet o.c.  
 
3.5.3. Equipment List. Presented in Table 3.11 is a list of materials and equipment for installing 
a recirculating sand filter for 3,000 gpd (11,360 Lpd), as designed above. Note: This list is only 
for the recirculating sand filter, so combine it with the conventional septic system list in Table 
3.5. For some installations, the addition of the recirculating sand filter will allow a reduction of 
leach field area by 50 percent.

3.6. Natural Land Treatment Systems. Natural land treatment systems are not designed to treat 
raw sewage; therefore, they must be preceded by either fine screens or primary sedimentation, or 
both. Designs include infiltration basins, spray irrigation systems, overland flow systems, and 
constructed wetlands. Sometimes referred to as nondischarge wastewater systems, their design 
should consider local conditions of water quality, climate, soil, hydrogeology, and environmental 
constraints. 
 
3.6.1. Rapid Infiltration Systems. Similar to the processes taking place in a sand filtration 
system, rapid infiltration systems use sand and soil at the surface to facilitate physical filtering 
while ion exchange, chemical precipitation, and adsorption occur as the water filters downward 
(Figure 3.13). Biological treatment also occurs as wastewater mixes with air in the top 2 to 3 
feet (0.6 to 1 m) of soil. Rapid infiltration’s highest removal rates are in suspended solids, fecal 
coliform, and BOD, with limited success in nutrient and heavy metals removal. Various 
methods for increasing the nutrient removal rate can be implemented, including varying the 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
89 
 
 
wetting and drying periods, adding a pre-treatment process, adding vegetation to the topsoil, or 
lengthening the soil depth through which treatment occurs. 
 
3.6.1.1. Since rapid infiltration systems operate on a feed/dry cycle, multiple process trains 
are required as a minimum so that one can be in use while the other(s) rest or dry (Figure 
3.14). Influent needs to be low in TSS to prevent soil clogging. This system is not a good 
choice in areas with high rainfall or extremely cold weather. 
 
3.6.1.2. While having one of the smaller aboveground footprints and typically being the most 
cost-effective to construct, rapid infiltration basins do have one of the shorter lifespans of 
most treatment processes as the land eventually become saturated with nutrients and heavy 
metals, reducing the systems’ treatment efficiency. Major factors in locating a rapid 
infiltration system include soil type, depth, and percolation rates. Sands and gravel are the 
most desirable soil types because they are the best at facilitating percolation.

3.6.2. Irrigation Systems. Spray irrigation systems distribute wastewater evenly on a vegetated 
plot for final treatment and discharge. Spray irrigation can be useful in areas where conventional 
onsite wastewater systems are unsuitable due to low soil permeability, shallow water depth 
table or impermeable layer, or complex site topography. The spray irrigation system may not 
be ideal for certain locations because of its large areal demands, the need to discontinue 
spraying during extended periods of cold weather, and the high potential for human contact 
with the wastewater during spraying. 
 
3.6.2.1. Spray irrigation systems are among the most land-intensive disposal systems. 
Drifting aerosols from spray heads can be a nuisance and should be monitored for impact on 
nearby land use and potential human contact. Consider using buffers, such as, vegetation, 
trees, or setback distances to mitigate exposure to sprayed wastewater. When using setback 
distances as a buffer, consider the predominant or prevailing wind direction during your 
deliberations. Note: Buffer zones for populated areas must often be as large as, or even larger 
than, the spray field itself to minimize problems. 
 
3.6.2.2. When designing a spray irrigation system, pretreatment of the wastewater may be 
provided by a septic tank (primary clarifier), aerobic unit, sand (media) filter, disinfection 
unit, or other pretreatment methods. The pretreated wastewater in spray irrigation systems 
is applied at low rates to grassy or wooded areas. Vegetation and soil microorganisms 
metabolize most nutrients and organic compounds in the wastewater during percolation 
through the first several inches of soil. The cleaned water is then absorbed by deep-rooted 
vegetation, or it passes through the soil to the ground water. 
 
3.6.3. Overland Flow. In overland flow treatment (Figure 3.15), pretreated wastewater is spread 
along a contour at the top of a gently sloping site that has minimum permeability. The 
wastewater then flows down the slope and is treated by microorganisms attached to vegetation 
as it travels by sheet flow over very impermeable soils until it is collected at the bottom of the 
slope for discharge. Note: The overland flow information and illustrations addressed in this 
section was adapted from EPA 625/R-06/016, Land Treatment of Municipal Wastewater 
Effluents. 
 
Figure 3.15. Overland Flow Hydraulic Pathway (Notional Layout). 
 
 
 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
91 
 
 
3.6.3.1. The overland flow treatment process requires large land areas similar to the spray 
irrigation system. However, any necessary surface water discharge requirements (e.g., 
disinfection) from the overland flow system should still be met. Overland flow systems 
require sufficient soil depth to form slopes that are uniform and to maintain a vegetative 
cover. A finished slope should have a minimum of 0.15 to 0.3 m (6 to 12 in) of soil depth. 
The slope should be graded so that it is smooth and of nearly constant grade. This is 
especially true near the upper reaches of the slope to prevent channeling of wastewater and 
poor treatment. 
 
3.6.3.2. When designing overland flow treatment systems, the general layout should match 
as closely as possible the natural topography at the site to minimize extensive earthwork. If 
anticipating multiple slopes, consider laying out individual treatment slopes on a topographic 
map of the site until the field area requirements are satisfied. Individual slopes should be 
connected with a network of ditches for collection of treated runoff and stormwater runoff 
for conveyance to the final system discharge point (Figure 3.16). The choice of the system 
layout is also influenced by the type of wastewater distribution. If wastewater contains 
coarse solids that can impair and clog orifices and valves in surface and sprinkler distribution 
systems, fine screening or primary sedimentation with surface skimming may be necessary 
to prevent operating difficulties. For small systems, consider using Imhoff tanks or 1- to 2-
day aerated detention ponds. For sprinkler distribution systems, screen sizes should be less 
than one-third the diameter of the sprinkler nozzle. Consider using grit removal for 
wastewaters containing high grit loads. Grit reduces pump life and can deposit in low-
velocity distribution pipelines.

AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
3.6.3.3. High-solids-content wastewaters are typically applied using high-pressure sprinklers 
to ensure uniform distribution of the solids on the treatment slope. Low-pressure systems 
involving gated pipe or sprinklers have been used successfully for screened, primary, 
secondary or pond effluents. The various possibilities for both high- and low-pressure types 
are illustrated in Figure 3.17. 
 
Figure 3.17. Wastewater Distribution Alternatives for Overland Flow. 
 
 
 
3.6.4. Constructed Wetlands. Both the FWS (surface flow) and SF (subsurface flow) 
constructed wetlands can be designed to provide secondary treatment of primary effluent or 
polishing treatment for secondary effluent. They are not for treatment of raw wastewater. These 
systems can also be used in combination with other secondary treatment technologies. For 
example, a constructed wetland could be placed upstream in the treatment train from an 
infiltration system to optimize the cost of secondary treatment. In other uses, constructed 
wetlands could discharge secondary effluent to enhancement wetlands for polishing. Figure 
3.18 portrays a hypothetical wastewater treatment train utilizing constructed wetlands in series. 
A brief overview of their design and function follows. The constructed wetlands design 
information and illustrations addressed in this section was adapted from EPA 625/R-99/010, 
Constructed Wetlands Treatment of Municipal Wastewaters.

3.6.4.1. FWS systems closely resemble natural wetlands in appearance and function, with a 
combination of open-water areas, emergent vegetation, varying water depths, and other 
typical wetland features. Figure 3.19 illustrates the main components of a FWS constructed 
wetland. A typical FWS constructed wetland consists of several components that may be 
modified among various applications but retain essentially the same features. These 
components include berms to enclose the treatment cells, inlet structures that regulate and 
distribute influent wastewater evenly for optimum treatment, various combinations of open-
water areas and fully vegetated surface areas, and outlet structures that complement the even 
distribution provided by inlet structures and allow adjustment of water levels within the 
treatment cell. Shape, size, and complexity of design often are functions of site 
characteristics rather than preconceived design criteria.

3.6.4.2. SF systems, sometimes referred to as vegetated submerged bed (VSB) systems, 
consist of gravel beds that may be planted with wetland vegetation. Figure 3.20 provides a 
schematic drawing of a SF system. Similar to the FWS system described above, a typical SF 
system contains berms and inlet and outlet structures for regulation and distribution of 
wastewater flow. In addition to shape and size, other variable factors are the choice of 
treatment media (gravel shape and size, for example) as an economic factor, and selection 
of vegetation as an optional feature that affects wetland aesthetics more than performance.

3.7. Package Wastewater Treatment Plants. Package wastewater treatment plants can be 
obtained from various manufacturers. Some prefabricated plants may be capable of being 
relocated, depending on size and original construction. Most of these units are factory fabricated 
and shipped as complete units, ready for connection to piping and power. When choosing the type 
and design of the wastewater treatment plant for the location, consider the wastewater 
characterization and average daily flow rates. The size of the system selected should be 
conservative to account for peak flow conditions. Also consider the effluent quality standards 
stated in guidance for the contingency location. Package treatment plants have been used for small, 
medium, and large installations, both temporary and permanent. Typically, wastewater treatment 
plants are designed to treat flows as low as 0.002 million gallon/day (mgd) or as high as 0.5 mgd, 
although they more commonly treat flows between 0.01 and 0.25 mgd. Effluent from these systems 
can be discharged to surface water or applied to the land. Chapter 2 provided an overview of the 
types of commercial systems and package plants. This section addresses design considerations for 
two common types of package plants, extended aeration, and sequencing batch reactors. 
 
3.7.1. Extended Aeration Package Plant. Extended aeration package plants are largely 
preassembled, allowing rapid installation with a minimum of site preparation. For this reason, 
they are sometimes used for temporary or emergency applications. Generally, extended aeration 
package plants utilize steel tankage, but precast concrete is also used. If the system is small 
enough, the entire system should arrive as one unit that is ready to be installed. Tanks may be 
compartmentalized into flow equalization, aeration, clarification, disinfection, and aerated 
sludge holding/digestion segments. For larger systems, segments such as the clarifier, aeration 
chamber, disinfection tank, and digestion tank (if included) may be delivered as separate units, 
which are then assembled on-site.

3.7.1.1. The design of package plants and components such as aeration basins and clarifiers 
are pre-engineered, therefore, system selection is mostly based on wastewater flow. 
Furthermore, biological organisms within the system need sufficient contact time with the 
organic material to produce effluent of an acceptable quality. Typical contact time for 
extended aeration package plants is approximately 18-24 hours. The contact time, daily flow 
rate, influent parameters, and effluent parameters determine the size of the aeration tank 
where air is used to mix wastewater and to supply oxygen to promote biological growth. 
 
3.7.1.2. An extended aeration package plant is sized based on the average volume of 
wastewater produced within a twenty-four hour period. Although provisions are made for 
some peaking factor, a flow equalization system may be necessary to prevent overloading 
of the system from inconsistent flow rates in the morning and evening. Equalization allows 
the wastewater to be delivered to the treatment plant at more manageable flow rates. Table 
3.12 provides typical sizing of unit processes at average design flows of 0.01 to 0.1 mgd.

3.7.1.3. The following process description was adapted from EPA 832-F-00-016, 
Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet: Package Plants. An extended-aeration process typically 
consists of coarse screening or comminution, activated-sludge aeration using course air 
diffusers or mechanical aerators, secondary clarification using surface skimming and return 
sludge pumping, disinfection often with chlorine storage and feed facilities, and transport to 
a contact basin. Sludge is typically wasted to an aerobic holding or aerobic stabilization 
compartment. Sludge disposal varies widely. Primary clarification is rarely used. As 
illustrated in Figure 3.21, the process starts when wastewater enters the extended aeration 
treatment system and is typically screened immediately to remove large suspended, 
settleable, or floating solids that could interfere with or damage equipment downstream in 
the process. Wastewater may then pass through a grinder to reduce large particles that are 
not captured in the screening process. If the plant requires the flow to be regulated, the 
effluent will then flow into equalization basins which regulate peak wastewater flow rates. 
Wastewater then enters the aeration chamber, where it is mixed, and oxygen is provided to 
96 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
the microorganisms. The mixed liquor then flows to a clarifier or settling chamber where 
most microorganisms settle to the bottom of the clarifier and a portion are pumped back to 
the incoming wastewater at the beginning of the plant. This returned material is the return 
activated sludge. The material that is not returned, the waste activated sludge, is removed 
for treatment and disposal. The clarified wastewater then flows over a weir and into a 
collection channel before being diverted to the disinfection system. Most package plants 
discharge to surface waters, although they have been used to treat wastewater prior to land 
application or even subsurface disposal. However, the mechanical complexity of such plants 
is generally not compatible with low-maintenance, land-based disposal options. 
 
Figure 3.21. Typical Extended Aeration Plant Treatment Process. 
 
 
 
3.7.2. Sequencing Batch Reactor. The sequencing batch reactor (SBR) design utilizes a 
suspended-growth (activated sludge) process in which all major steps occur in the same reactor 
tank in sequential order. There are many types of SBR systems and modifications based on 
different manufacturer designs. The type of SBR system used depends on site and wastewater 
characteristics as well as the needs of the base or site installing the unit. Package SBRs are often 
manufactured to treat wastewater flow rates between 0.01 and 0.2 MGD, although flow rates 
can vary based on the system and manufacturer. When the wastewater flow rate at the site is 
less than 0.05 MGD, a single, prefabricated steel tank can be used. If the plant must be able to 
treat 0.1 to 1.5 MGD, multiple concrete SBR basins are commonly used. Single tank designs 
are usually divided into one SBR basin, one aerobic sludge digester, and one influent pump 
well. Typically, SBR systems contain two or more reactor tanks that are operated in parallel, or 
one equalization tank and one reactor tank. The type of tank configuration used depends on the 
wastewater flow characteristics (e.g., high or low volume). While the parallel setup allows the 
system to accommodate continuous influent flow, it does not provide for disinfection or holding 
for aerated sludge. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
97 
 
 
3.7.2.1. Shown in Figure 3.22 is a diagram of the SBR treatment process. The influent flow 
first goes through a screening process before entering the SBR. The waste is then treated in 
a series of batch phases within the SBR to achieve the desired effluent concentration. The 
sludge that is wasted from the SBR moves on to digestion and eventually to solids handling, 
disposal, or beneficial reuse. The treated effluent then moves to disinfection. An equalization 
tank is typically needed before the disinfection unit in batch SBRs to store large volumes of 
water. If the flow is not equalized, a sizable filter may be necessary to accommodate the 
large flow of water entering the disinfection system. In addition, SBR systems typically have 
no primary or secondary clarifiers as settling takes place in the SBR. 
 
Figure 3.22. Typical Sequencing Batch Reactor Treatment Process. 
 
 
 
3.7.2.2. The SBR treatment cycle treats batches of wastewater in five major steps or phases 
(Fill, React, Settle, Decant, and Idle). Figure 3.23 illustrates the SBR sequence of operation. 
In the fill phase, raw wastewater enters the basin, where it is mixed with settled biomass 
from the previous cycle. Some aeration may occur during this phase. Then, in the react phase, 
the basin is aerated, allowing oxidation and nitrification to occur. During the settling phase, 
aeration and mixing are suspended and the solids are allowed to settle. The treated 
wastewater is then discharged from the basin in the decant phase. In the final phase, the basin 
is idle as it waits for the start of the next cycle. During this time, part of the solids is removed 
from the basin and disposed of as waste sludge. Sludge wasting is an important step in the 
SBR process and largely affects system performance. It is not considered a basic phase since 
the sludge is not wasted at a specific time period during the cycle. The quantity and rate of 
wasting is determined by performance requirements. An SBR system does not require a 
return activated sludge system, as both aeration and settling occur in the same tank. This 
prevents any sludge from being lost during the “react” step and eliminates the need to return 
sludge from the clarifier to the aeration chamber.

3.8. Disinfection Design Considerations. Untreated domestic wastewater contains micro-
organisms or pathogens that produce human diseases. The disinfection process kills these harmful 
organisms during wastewater treatment to meet effluent standards. Disinfection is generally 
required in three onsite-system circumstances. The first is after any process that is to be surface 
discharged. The second is before a subsurface wastewater infiltration system where there is 
inadequate soil (depth to ground water or structure too porous) to meet ground water quality 
standards. The third is prior to some other immediate reuse (onsite recycling) of effluent that 
stipulates some specific pathogen requirement (e.g., toilet flushing or vegetation watering). While 
there are several disinfection methods, ultraviolet and chlorine disinfection are likely options for 
small wastewater treatment systems. Table 3.13 lists a number of factors to consider when 
selecting one of these disinfection systems. Certain information presented here was adapted from 
the EPA Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet, Disinfection for Small Systems. Find these and other 
EPA wastewater treatment system publications at https://search.epa.gov/epasearch/epasearch.

construction phases tend to be larger. 
2. Recent studies have shown that UV radiation may be effective against oocysts.

Systems 
 
3.8.1. Ultraviolet Disinfection. The effectiveness of a UV disinfection system depends on the 
characteristics of the wastewater, the intensity of UV radiation, the amount of time the 
microorganisms are exposed to the radiation, and the reactor configuration. Various commercial 
UV disinfection systems are available for onsite applications. Most are self-contained and 
provide low-pressure mercury arc lamps encased by quartz glass tubes (Figure 3.24). The unit 
should be installed downstream of the final treatment process and protected from the elements. 
UV units must be located near a power source and should be readily accessible for maintenance 
and inspection. Appropriate controls for the unit must be corrosion-resistant and enclosed in 
accordance with electrical codes. Other design considerations include: 
 
• A stable source of high-voltage electricity will be required. 
• The lamps may not run without wastewater flow; this will cause overheating. 
• A set of spare parts recommended by the manufacturer cab be stored on site so the 
system will not be inoperable due to shipping delays. 
• The UV lamps can be equipped with an automatic cleaning system, such as wipers, to 
100 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
remove buildup on the lamp; generally, the UV disinfection system manufacturer will 
provide such an automatic cleaning system. 
• A monitoring and alarm (instrumentation and control) system are usually provided by 
the manufacturer. 
• Unless instantaneous backup power is available, the effluent is stored during power 
outages. 
• Providing two units assures continuous disinfection even when one unit is inoperable. 
• In all cases consult the manufacturer for project-specific site requirements and 
equipment selection. 
 
Figure 3.24. Parallel Wastewater Flow in Quartz UV Unit. 
 
 
 
3.8.1.1. There are two types of UV disinfection reactor configurations: contact and 
noncontact. In both types, wastewater can flow either perpendicular or parallel to the lamps. 
In the contact reactor, a series of mercury lamps are enclosed in quartz sleeves to minimize 
the cooling effects of the wastewater. Flap gates or weirs are used to control the level of the 
wastewater. 
 
3.8.1.2. In the noncontact reactor, UV lamps are suspended outside a transparent conduit 
which carries the wastewater to be disinfected. In both types of reactors, a ballast or control 
box provides a starting voltage for the lamps and maintains a continuous current. 
 
3.8.2. Chlorine Disinfection. Use only chlorine tablets intended for wastewater in a tablet 
chlorinator. Wastewater chlorine tablets are made of calcium hypochlorite. Do not use 
swimming pool chlorine tablets for wastewater applications. Swimming pool chlorine tablets 
consist of trichloroisocyanuric acid, which works too slowly to be effective in wastewater. 
Additionally, swimming pool chlorine tablets can sometimes interact with wastewater in such 
a way as to produce explosive gas. Never mix swimming pool chlorine contact tablets with 
wastewater chlorine contact tablets; an explosive compound may form. Check the ingredient 
label on the tablets to ensure personnel use the proper tablets. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
101 
 
 
3.8.2.1. A chlorine tablet gradually dissolves in the contact chamber of the tablet chlorinator 
and the tablet in the tube above it eventually falls into the wastewater stream. It is important 
that the proper amount of contact between the chlorine tablet and the wastewater occur. Too 
little contact time results in insufficiently disinfected wastewater; too much contact time 
dissolves the tablets very quickly and results in an excess of chorine, which can be damaging 
to the environment. With most tablet chlorinators, the amount of the tablet(s) in contact with 
the wastewater is adjustable to add or reduce contact. 
 
3.8.2.2. Sufficient chlorination generally occurs if the water in the storage reservoir contains 
0.2 mg of chlorine per liter of wastewater. This can be determined by using a chlorine test 
kit. The test kit requires the operator to mix a small amount of chlorinated wastewater in a 
solution and compare the resulting color with the colors shown in the kit to determine the 
chlorine concentration. The operator can adjust the chlorine contact as necessary. Test kits 
using paper strips are much less accurate and not recommended for use. 
 
3.8.2.3. Approximately 15 minutes of contact time with the 0.2 mg/L chlorine solution is 
required in the storage reservoir prior to discharge for proper disinfection. Table 3.14 is an 
example calculation to size the storage reservoir. 
 
Table 3.14. Calculation for Storage Reservoir (Notional). 
 
Storage Reservoir Calculations 
Known: 
Average daily flow: 3,000 gpd 
Peak flow (peaking factor): 2.5 x average flow rate Detention time: 15 minutes 
Determine: 
Volume of storage reservoir 
Calculation: 
Average flow rate: 3,000 gpd ÷ 1,440 minutes per day = 2.1 gpm Peak flow: 2.5 x 2 
gpm = 5.2 gpm 
Volume = flow x detention time = 5.2 gpm x 15 minutes = 78 gallons 
 
3.8.2.4. Because chlorine is toxic to aquatic life, dechlorination after the storage reservoir 
may be required, particularly if the discharge is to surface waters. Many chlorine tablet 
manufacturers also sell sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) tablets to dechlorinate. The sodium sulfite 
tablets are positioned in a contact chamber similar to the chlorine contact chamber but 
downstream of the storage reservoir. The reaction between the chlorine and the sodium 
sulfite is instantaneous so another storage reservoir is not required. About 2 mg/L of sodium 
sulfite is required per 1 mg/L of chlorine. 
 
3.9. Wastewater Collection System and Pumping. The type of collection system will depend 
mainly on site topography, process selection, and siting of the treatment system and 
outlet/discharge relative to the source location. Where possible, gravity piping is encouraged since 
pumping requires electrical power for operation and controls. Legal (e.g., international 
102 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
agreements) and operational (e.g., COCOM/operational chain of command) requirements may 
also affect the type of collection system that can be used at a specific location. 
 
3.9.1. Gravity Sewers. PVC sewer pipe, couplings, and fittings conform to ASTM D3034, 
Standard Specification for Type PSM Poly (Vinyl Chloride) (PVC) Sewer Pipe and Fittings, 
with standard dimension ratio (SDR) 35. Joints are typically push-on, using permanently 
bonded elastomeric ring gaskets per the pipe manufacturer’s written instructions. Where surface 
or very shallow installation is necessary, consider Schedule 40 ductile iron pipe instead of PVC. 
Table 3.15 lists minimum slopes for various sewer diameters and associated capacities. Where 
possible, greater slopes are desirable; however, avoid velocities greater than 10 feet per second 
(1 m/s).

3.9.2. Sewer Manholes. Most sewer manholes are made of pre-cast concrete sections with a 
hand-troweled invert formed in the base after installation of structure and sewer piping. Figure 
3.25 shows a section of a typical sewer manhole (not to scale). Applicable codes for manhole 
fabrication include those listed below. Note: See Attachment 2 for hyperlink to ASTM 
standards. 
 
• ASTM C478, Standard Specification for Circular Precast Reinforced Concrete Manhole 
Sections. 
• ASTM A184, Standard Specification for Welded Deformed Steel Bar Mats for Concrete 
Reinforcement. 
• ASTM A615, Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Carbon-Steel Bars for 
Concrete Reinforcement.

3.9.3. Bar Screens. Designers of WWTFs often use bar screens when processing raw sewage 
from a collection system. However, the wastewater alternatives provided in this publication 
focus on smaller treatment facilities served by a limited collection system. These smaller 
systems operate very well using a septic tank for pre-treatment where large solids and debris 
are not a concern. When used, bar screens require consistent maintenance. If using a bar screen 
at a deployment site, especially for a natural system, follow the O&M recommendations in 
Chapter 4. Bar screens are typically fabricated of galvanized steel with bar dimensions between 
0.375 inch (10 mm) to 2 inches (50 mm) thick, by about 2 inches (50 mm) deep (Figure 3.26). 
Commonly, the position of the bars are at a 35 degree to 45-degree angle from the horizontal.

3.9.4. Pumping Systems and Force Main Sizing. Pumping stations may be necessary to deliver 
septic tank effluent to a mounded or dosed leach field or alternative system for additional 
treatment. In some cases, pumping may be necessary to feed raw sewage from certain sources 
to the wastewater collection system. The discharge from the pump is through a pressurized pipe 
(e.g., force main). Minimum force main diameter varies with the quality of the wastewater 
conveyed and minimum velocities required to avoid solids settlement in the pipe. In general, 
force mains for raw sewage applications need to be a minimum of 4 inches (101 mm) in 
diameter. Where anticipating low flows, use grinder pumps to reduce the risk of clogged force 
main piping. Effluent dosing arrangements utilize PVC or high-density polyethylene pipe 
unless conditions warrant the use of ductile iron pipe. Where pumps are installed, the following 
should be provided: 
 
• Duplex submersible pumps with alternating controls for redundancy (or spare back-up 
pump available for immediate replacement). 
• Alarm for failure notification, wired on separate circuit. 
• Emergency storage volume in tank equal to design flow. 
• Watertight tank constructed of concrete or fiberglass (steel not recommended). 
• Raw sewage flows pumped using non-clog or grinder pumps capable of handling 3-inch 
(76 mm) solids. 
• Install pumps with a quick-disconnect coupling to facilitate O&M. 
 
3.9.4.1. Pump Selection Procedure and Example. There are several types of pumps available 
for conveying wastewater. However, the type of pump used in septic tanks and as 
recirculation pumps for recirculating sand filters are submersible. Submersible pumps have 
a pump and motor designed for installation in the wet well or even fully submerged. These 
pumps do not require an influent pipe but must be submerged for adequate cooling and safe 
operation. To determine the size of the pump for each application, the required flow, force 
main size, and total dynamic head (TDH) need to be determined. Once established, provide 
this information to pump manufacturers for pump selection. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
105 
 
 
3.9.4.1.1. Step 1: Determine the Peak Flow. Pumps are sized based on the peak hour flow 
(peak flow), not the ADF used to size the septic tank, leach basin, and recirculating sand 
filter. Peak flow determined by multiplying the ADF by a peaking factor (PF). The 
maximum anticipated flow rate for an installation based on the data below is 15,000 gpd, 
which is a very low flow. A PF of 5 is recommended for most applications in this flow 
range. Note: The PF is expressed as a ratio of the maximum daily flow divided by the 
average daily flow. The ratio generally ranges from 1.2 for very large water systems to 
3.0 or even higher for specific small systems. In this example, maximum daily flow 
(15,000 gpd) divided by the average daily flow (3,000 gpd) equals a PF of 5. 
 
Peak flow = ADF x PF  
ADF = 3,000 gpd; PF = 5 
Peak flow = 3,000 gpd x 5 
Peak flow = 15,000 gpd or 10.5 gpm 
 
3.9.4.1.2. Step 2: Determine Required Wet Well Size. Based on the peak flow and 
dimensions of the wet well, determine the pump run time per cycle. Use the following 
criteria when determining if a wet well is adequately sized: 
 
• Pumps cycle on/off no more than four times per hour. 
• Pumps run for several minutes at a time without dewatering the wet well. 
 
3.9.4.1.2.1. Determine volume of wet well per inch. The following uses data from 
Table 3.4, “Septic Tank Design Example.” 
 
L1 = 6 feet  
W = 6 feet  
H = 12 feet 
Volume = 3,000 gallons 
Gallons per inch (gpi) = 3,000 gallons ÷ 144 inches  
gpi = 20.8 
 
3.9.4.1.2.2. Set level control for pumps to turn on 6 inches above low-level set point. 
 
Volume to be pumped = 6 inches x 20.8 gpi  
Volume to be pumped = 125 gallons  
Determine pump run time (TP) 
TP = 125 gallons ÷ 10.5 gpm  
TP = 12 minutes 
Pump will run one to two times per hour (acceptable) 
 
3.9.4.1.3. Step 3: Determine Force Main Size. 
 
3.9.4.1.3.1. Once the peak flow has been determined, size the force main. The diameter 
of the force main will impact pump selection as the friction losses through the pipe are 
directly related to the flow rate through the pipe. As a rule of thumb, maintain the 
106 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
velocity of the flow in the force main between 3 feet per second (fps) and 5 fps to keep 
solids suspended and avoid deposition in the line. 
 
Q (cfs) = A (ft)2 x V (ft/s) 
 
3.9.4.1.3.2. Rearrange the equation to solve for area (A). 
 
A = Q ÷ V 
 
3.9.4.1.3.3. Convert Q from gpd to cfs: 
 
Q = 15,000 gpd ÷ 7.48 gallons/ft3 ÷ 86,400 seconds/day 
Q = 0.0232 cfs 
 
3.9.4.1.3.4. Assume velocity = 4 fps 
 
3.9.4.1.3.5. Solve for A: 
 
A = 0.0232 CFS ÷ 4 fps 
A = 0.0058 ft. 
A = π x r2 
 
3.9.4.1.3.6. Solve for r: 
 
r = (A ÷ π)1/2 
r = 0.043 feet 
r = 0.515 inch 
d = 1.03 inches 
 
3.9.4.1.3.7. Use a force main diameter of 1 inch. 
 
3.9.4.1.4. Step 4: Determine the TDH. The TDH is the total height that a fluid is to be 
pumped, taking into account friction losses in the pipe. Find the TDH by adding the 
difference in water surface elevation (static head) to the losses in the pipe due to friction 
(fL). Following is an example for determining the TDH of a septic system pump that 
pumps to a gravity-leach field. 
 
3.9.4.1.4.1. Step 4a: Calculate Static Head.  
 
Pump on elevation:  
Evaluation of influent pipe at leach field: 
 
Static head (ft.) = elevation at leach field (ft.) – pump on elevation (ft.)  
Static head = 17.43 ft. – 7.41 ft. 
Static head = 10.02 ft. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
107 
 
 
3.9.4.1.4.2. Step 4b: Calculate Friction Losses. In addition to the elevation difference 
between the starting and ending points, the pump also has to overcome the friction of 
the fluid moving through the pipe. The longer the pipe length between the pump and 
the final discharge point, the greater the friction loss. 
 
3.9.4.1.4.2.1. Calculate the losses in the straight pipe using the Hazen-Williams 
Equation.  
 
fL = ([4.52 x L X Q1.85) ÷ (C1.85 x d4.87]) x 2.31 
 
Where:  
fL = friction loss in feet  
L = length of pipe (ft.)  
Q = flow 
C = Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient 
d = hydraulic diameter (interior diameter of pipe in inches 
 
3.9.4.1.4.2.2. If the septic tank effluent to the leach field includes 400 feet of 1-
inch PVC pipe, then the friction loss in the straight pipe can be determined. 
 
Total pipe length = distance from septic tank to leach field + vertical distance 
from pump discharge 
 
Total pipe length (ft.) = 400 ft. + 7.86 ft.  
Total pipe length (ft.) = 407.86 ft. 
 
3.9.4.1.4.2.3. Calculate the friction loss in the straight pipe:  
 
fL (ft.) = (4.73 x L x Q1.85) ÷ (C1.85 x d4.87) 
fL = ([4.73 x 407.86 x (15,000 gpd ÷ 1440 mins/day)1.85] ÷ [1201.85 x 14.87]) x 
2.31  
fL = 48.48 ft. 
 
3.9.4.1.4.2.4. Additional losses, such as those through fittings, may be 
insignificant and ignored if there are a small number of fittings (less than five). 
If there are a large number of fittings, account for the losses by adding another 
2 to 3 feet of head loss to the final calculation. If the designer prefers to calculate 
the actual head loss through these fittings, then the designer consults one of the 
numerous hydraulic handbooks on the market. These handbooks provide tables, 
charts, and equations for determining the head loss through fittings. Note: As 
with minor loss tables, numerous Hazen-Williams coefficient tables are 
available. The designer should select the appropriate coefficient based on the 
pipe material and age. A sample Hazen-Williams coefficient table is provided in 
Table 3.16.

TREATMENT SYSTEM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) 
 
4.1. General Information. For effective utilization of the design capabilities of WWTFs, 
personnel must provide the required attention and maintenance. Treatment system operators are 
responsible for the system’s O&M. However, if more than one person operates the facility, every 
operator working together as a team will ensure that the equipment and processes operate properly. 
This chapter provides general information for operation and maintenance of wastewater treatment 
systems. It should help personnel handle routine O&M and recognize problems that require help 
from suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, and engineers. Although most of these systems include 
operations that require little attention by an operator, nothing can replace the experience, judgment, 
and observations of trained personnel. As with any manufacturing process, efficient and 
economical operation of a wastewater treatment system depends on the personnel observing and 
operating the equipment. Good operating techniques provide, as a minimum, the following benefits 
to the installation: 
 
• The treatment system functions as designed and constructed. 
• Operating costs are held to a minimum. 
• Repairs and damage to equipment are minimized. 
• Good public relations results from preventing water pollution. 
 
4.2. Basic Guide to Operations Monitoring. Once construction is complete, the facility will go 
into operation. Daily monitoring of the various processes is essential to ensuring their proper long-
term function. If maintaining proper records, monitoring will alert the operators to potential or 
existing problems. Table 4.1 is a guide to developing a comprehensive monitoring program. See 
individual system information in subsequent paragraphs for specific O&M methods.

4.3. Septic Systems O&M. A properly designed and maintained septic system requires very little 
O&M intervention except for the periodic removal of accumulated settled solids and scum. 
Preventive care and smart use measures have more impact on the successful operation of a septic 
system than anything that is done after the fact. Typically, septic systems operate on gravity, but 
some systems are equipped with influent or effluent pumps, or both. Maintenance intervals on 
pumps in this type of service are likely to be more frequent than on other pump installations due 
to the nature of the product conveyed. The following Do’s and Don’ts will support long-term use: 
 
• Don’t plant trees or shrubs within 50 feet (15 m) of a septic tank or leach field; if any trees 
or shrubs exist within that perimeter, remove them. 
• Don’t operate wheeled or tracked vehicles over the tank or leach field; the weight may 
damage the pipes and structures and could compact the soil, making the leach field less 
efficient. 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
111 
 
 
• Don’t build or dig within the leach field area—it could damage the distribution piping. 
• Don’t place pavement or landscaping plastic over the leach field; if pavement is necessary, 
the field piping must be vented to the atmosphere. 
• Don’t allow surface waters to flow or pool in the leach field area, channel the water 
elsewhere. 
• Do allow grass or shallow-rooted plants to grow over the leach field to cut down on erosion 
and help absorb treated water discharged into the field. 
• Don’t dispose of grease or oils into the septic tank influent; wipe greasy cooking utensils 
clean before washing. 
• Don’t dispose of bleach and harsh cleaners down drains; these chemicals can disrupt the 
bacteria in the septic tank, negatively affecting the treatment process. 
• Do install grease separator tanks on the discharge piping from all kitchen facilities; 
regularly maintain the tanks to prevent grease carry-over to the sanitary sewer. 
• Don’t use in-sink garbage disposals; if a garbage disposal is installed, the accumulated 
solids in the tank will need to be removed more often. 
• Avoid introducing a large amount of water over a short period of time; wash dishes and 
clothes in small increments rather than saving them for big loads. 
• Don’t introduce anything into the sewage system except bodily wastes, wash water, and 
toilet paper; avoid flushing cigarette butts, paper towels, female sanitary products, plastics, 
and rubber products down the toilet. 
 
4.3.1. Septic Tank Inspection and Pumpout Intervals. The primary O&M task when operating 
a septic system is periodic inspection of the septic tank and removal of the accumulated settled 
solids and the scum layer by pumping out the entire contents of the tank. A minimal effort to 
perform periodic maintenance will significantly reduce the risk of septic tank overload and 
carry- over into the leach field. Keep a log to record inspections, sludge and scum 
measurements, and pump-out dates. This log will be useful for long-term monitoring by 
changing maintenance personnel and will be a helpful reference when conditions change and 
require more frequent pumping. Inspection recommendations include: 
 
• Inspect the tank and all tee locations at least annually. 
• Remove sludge before it exceeds 25 to 35 percent of the tank’s working volume. 
• Always remove scum when pumping sludge and when it accumulates near the outlet 
tees. 
• Remove, clean, and reinstall the effluent filters during all tank inspections. 
• If any accumulation is apparent in the outlet tee, also check the leach field distribution 
box or dosing pump chamber for carryover. 
 
4.3.1.1. There are simple means to measure sludge and scum in a septic tank and determine 
the remaining working volume. The following paragraphs address two of those methods: 
 
4.3.1.1.1. Method 1 – Core Sampler or “Sludge Judge.” This device is available for 
purchase and simple to make using clear plastic 1-inch (25 mm) pipe fitted with a ball 
valve at the end (see Figure 4.1). Inspection is a fundamental part of maintenance. This 
device measures scum and sludge depth in the septic tank by taking a column sample. A 
ball valve at the bottom of the tube seals fluid in when raising the tube out of the tank. 
112 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
 
• Step 1. Lower the device vertically to the bottom of the tank (ball valve on 
bottom). 
• Step 2. Lift the device straight up; the ball valve will retain the column of 
liquid/solids in the pipe. 
• Step 3. Measure the layers of scum, sludge, and clear (working volume). 
 
4.3.1.1.2. Method 2 – Stick and Foot/Sock Device. This device includes a long stick with 
a 3- inch (7.6 cm) piece of wood attached across one end, forming a “foot.” The device 
is simple to assemble. 
 
• Step 1. Use the foot to push through the scum layer until resistance is felt from 
the liquid layer. 
• Step 2. Pull out the device and measure the scum layer on the stick. 
• Step 3. Remove the foot from the stick. 
• Step 4. Wrap a cloth around the stick and secure with rubber bands or other 
method. 
• Step 5. Lower stick through the hole made previously in the scum layer. 
• Step 6. Push the stick down through the liquid in the tank until it hits the bottom 
of the tank. 
• Step 7. Lift the stick out of the tank and measure the depth that the solids are 
sticking to the cloth. 
 
Figure 4.1. Use of Sludge Judge. 
 
4.3.1.2. Septic tank pump-out recommended if any of the following conditions exist: 
 
• The solids layer is at or above one-third of the tank volume (depth). 
• The bottom of the scum layer is within 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the bottom of inlet baffle. 
• The bottom of the scum layer is within 8 inches (20.3 cm) of the bottom of outlet 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
113 
 
 
device. 
• Less than two-thirds of working depth remains (pump out the tank in its entirety). 
 
4.3.1.3. Typically, personnel use vacuum tank trucks to pump out septic tanks. The pumper 
will use a 4- to 6-inch (101 to 152 mm) -diameter hose and vacuum everything out of the 
tank (both solids and liquids). Take the septage removed to a host nation government-
licensed or authorized disposal site because of potential health problems from 
contamination. Such sites may include evaporation ponds, sewage plants, or wastewater 
treatment plants that accept septage for further treatment and processing. Procedure for tank 
pump-outs: 
 
• Remove the entire contents of the tank through an access port located on top of the 
tank. 
• Do not pump out the tank through the distribution box. 
• Dispose of the contents of the tank in an environmentally neutral way; if hauling 
offsite to a nearby WWTF is not possible, consider passive land disposal based on 
terrain and climate conditions. 
 
4.3.2. Leach Field Inspection and Checks. After several years of use, a build-up of bottom 
sludge and floating scum will reduce the effective capacity of the tank. This means waste passes 
through the tank too quickly and solids eventually plug the pipes in the leach field. The 
microorganisms in the leach field no longer have an aerobic (with oxygen) environment in 
which to perform their cleansing action; they are now struggling to survive in an anaerobic 
(without oxygen) environment. Either untreated effluent begins surfacing on the ground or 
sewage backs up into the connected building drains. At this point, the system has failed, and a 
new leach field is required. The only remedy for a non-functional leach field is replacement. 
There is no evidence that commercially available enzymes or chemical treatments can revitalize 
a leach field. There may be some short-term relief, but the problem will return quickly upon 
reuse of the system. To construct a new leach field on top of an existing field, dig trenches 
parallel to the existing pipes or widen the existing trenches. 
 
4.3.3. Troubleshooting System Problems. There are warning signs that indicate a septic system 
may be failing rather than just requiring a pumpout. The indicators shown below and the 
information in Table 4.2 may be helpful to troubleshoot and pinpoint system problems and 
identify potential remedies. 
 
• Obnoxious odors in the system area or connected structures. 
• Soft ground or newly occurring low spots in the system area. 
• Grass growing faster or greener in the system area. 
• Gurgling sounds in the plumbing or plumbing backups. 
• Sluggishness in a toilet when flushed. 
• Appearance of bacteria in nearby well water. 
 
4.3.3.1. The distribution box (D-box) connects a single effluent line from the septic tank to 
a network of absorption lines. Adjustable weir outlets with eccentric openings permit 
balancing flow among drainfield lines. 
114 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
 
4.3.3.2. An examination of the septic system distribution box interior may show flood lines 
in the box if a clogged or saturated drainfield occurred in the past, even if the box is not 
flooded at the time of inspection. If the septic drainfields have been flooded, continued use 
of the drainfield may be in jeopardy. Check whether site drainage patterns have changed or 
experienced flooding and make corrections, if possible.

4.3.3.3. Figure 4.2 shows a distribution box uncovered for inspection. All drainfield inlet 
lines are visible and the box is not flooded. Adjustable weir outlets are useful in making 
limited adjustments for a distribution box that has settled out of level after installation. As 
shown in Figure 4.2, adjust the outlet weirs by rotating the device to place the eccentric hole 
higher or lower with respect to the water level, thus compensating for a slightly tipped box, 
differences in leach line length, or differences in leach line condition. Two types of round 
plugs or outlets (Figure 4.3), typically 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter are available through 
on-line distributors.

4.4. Lagoon Systems O&M. Lagoons are simple to operate and therefore often neglected. Most 
problems with lagoon systems are due to poor housekeeping or process overloading. If the lagoon 
design and size is appropriate and the population it serves does not increase significantly, loading 
problems are usually not an issue. The following paragraphs concern best practices and 
housekeeping issues that can affect lagoon operation. For additional information, refer to UFC 3-
240-01. 
 
4.4.1. Best Practices. There are best practices for lagoon maintenance. External sources of water 
can be diverted away to avoid filling the lagoon beyond capacity with flow that does not need 
to be treated. Excess turbulence from run-off can also disturb the facultative layers. Lagoons 
are not for treating hazardous chemicals. All excess hazardous chemicals should be disposed of 
116 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
in accordance with product labels. Provide regular maintenance for grass, weeds, and general 
vegetation around and in the lagoons. Remove any growths or obstacles within the lagoon to 
avoid disturbing the flow pattern and create short-circuiting or “dead spots.” Remove blue-
green algae to maintain the health of the lagoon. Algal blooms can occur when the desirable 
green algae reproduce rapidly in response to changes in weather and then dies off, creating 
odors and clouding. Foul odors may release during the changing seasons, as changing 
temperatures within the facultative layers causes the anaerobic layer to rise as the aerobic layer 
sinks. Monitor the anaerobic layer yearly for thickness and removal as necessary. 
 
4.4.2. Bar Screens. Provide lagoons with bar screens in their inlet structure. Inspect these 
screens at least twice a day, more often during storms, and clean as necessary. Dispose of 
screenings immediately in a sanitary manner. One method is burial in a nearby trench, another 
is to place the screenings into containers with lids (e.g., garbage cans) and arrange to empty 
containers on a regular basis. Consider burying in a landfill or incinerating the collected 
screenings. 
 
4.4.3. Mixing and Aeration. Lagoons can be operated efficiently without mechanical mixing or 
aeration if they are not overloaded and the naturally occurring circulation and the oxygen 
supplied by suspended plant growth is sufficient to support stabilization of the organic wastes 
in the influent. For more heavily loaded lagoons, or for lagoons located in difficult climates 
(extremely low or high temperatures, or extremely heavy precipitation), mechanical mixing 
and/or aeration may be required. Most systems or devices that mix or move water around 
require a source of electrical power. If this is not available or would be difficult to obtain, solar-
powered mixer/aerators are available. These devices are floating mixers anchored in the lagoon 
and powered by solar panels. (One source for this type of mixer is Solar Bee®). 
 
4.4.3.1. Floating mixers/aerators, however powered, are the best choice for lagoons, but 
other methods include: 
 
• Pumped recirculation of the lagoon contents (for mixing only). 
• Diffused low-pressure air (aeration only; energy-intensive; not very efficient in 
lagoon environments). 
• Use of an air-cooled outboard motor mounted on a small boat. 
 
4.4.3.2. Regardless of the system in use, the operator matches the mixer/aerator operating 
time with the dissolved oxygen requirements of the lagoon. Too much dissolved oxygen is 
not better than just enough and, since it wastes energy and incurs needless wear on the 
equipment, it is not a good practice to over-mix or over-aerate the lagoon contents. 
 
4.4.4. Scum Control. Scum accumulation is common in lagoons—more so in the spring in 
temperate climates when biological activity resumes as water temperature rises. Wind often 
dissipates scum accumulations, but, in the absence of wind, or in sheltered areas, mechanical 
means may be an option to break up the scum. Address scum accumulations in a timely manner 
because if they are allowed to remain, over time the scum can cause objectionable odors and 
may dry out and become crusted, making it more difficult to break up. Scum may be broken up 
with rakes or jets of water from the shore or with rakes from boats. Personnel can also use 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
117 
 
 
outboard motors as a means of breaking up scum layers. Use air-cooled motors because algae 
and scum can easily plug water-cooled motors. 
 
4.4.5. Odor Control. Most incidents of odor generation in a lagoon result from either 
overloading or poor maintenance. Process upsets caused by unexpected shutdowns can also 
trigger an odor event. If operators suspect overloading, divert the influent to another treatment 
source (e.g., a second lagoon) to allow time for the odor to resolve itself. Gradually resume 
loading after the odor subsides. Other effective measures to reduce odor include the following: 
 
• Adding chlorine. 
• Providing mechanical aeration. 
• Odor-masking agents are another possibility, but, in the long run they are less effective 
than the remedies noted above. 
• Sodium nitrate can also be used to reduce odors, but it must be dispersed throughout the 
pond to be effective. 
 
4.4.5.1. There are a few items to note regarding the effectiveness of the above-listed 
remedies. Unless chlorination equipment or floating aerators are already on hand, it could 
be difficult to acquire and install the necessary equipment to aerate and/or chlorinate in a 
timely manner. In addition, sodium nitrate provides a source of oxygen for the facultative 
organisms in the lagoon and does not interfere with biological activity like chlorine or 
sodium hypochlorite. 
 
4.4.5.2. Regardless of the method chosen to address odor issues, it is not wise to wait until 
an odor situation arises before deciding what to do about it. Prior planning related to 
addressing an odor incident allows the operator to react quickly without having to decide 
what to do and then try to locate the necessary equipment and/or chemicals. 
 
4.4.6. Weed and Insect Control. Weed control is an essential part of lagoon maintenance. There 
are three areas of concern: 
 
• The lagoon levee. 
• The shallow areas on the edge of the lagoon. 
• Suspended vegetation growing on the water’s surface. 
 
4.4.6.1. Basic control of weeds (undesirable vegetation in unwanted areas) on the levee 
consists of a program of regular mowing combined with planting grasses that choke out 
weeds. Consider use of herbicides only as a last resort. Another option may be to place riprap 
or install a lagoon liner to reduce or eliminate unwanted growth on the sloped portion of the 
levee. 
 
4.3.6.2. Shallow water vegetation (e.g., tules) can be reduced or eliminated by maintaining 
the lagoon depth at 3 feet (1 m) or greater. For vegetation control in edge areas where this 
may not be possible, consider the following options: 
 
• Prompt removal of emergent vegetation, including roots, is the best means of control 
118 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
• Manipulate the level in lagoon to either expose vegetation for removal or drown it 
• Burning them out with a gas burner is also an option. 
 
4.4.6.3. Without lagoon edge vegetation, the likelihood of insect propagation greatly 
reduces. When removing emergent growth be sure to wear the appropriate gear, including 
approved flotation devices and work safely. Caution: Do not work alone on the edge of a 
lagoon or in a boat. Drowning after a slip or fall is a continuing risk. 
 
4.4.6.4. Suspended vegetation (e.g., duckweed) will not flourish in a lagoon exposed to wind. 
Remove any established suspended vegetation, typically by collecting it with rakes or other 
implements while in a boat if it is not reachable from the shore. 
 
4.4.6.5. Mosquitoes commonly breed in sheltered water areas with vegetation or scum where 
the female mosquito can attach her egg rafts. If the scum is broken up or removed and 
vegetation removed, the fragile mosquito egg rafts will not survive. Also, consider 
introducing small mosquito fish for mosquito control. Insecticides best control midges, when 
present. If it becomes necessary to use an insecticide, check with local authorities to find out 
which insecticides are acceptable. Always follow safe application procedures, including 
ambient conditions necessary for safe and effective application of the insecticide. 
 
4.4.7. Levee Maintenance. Levees may erode by (1) wave action or surface runoff during 
rainstorms or (2) animal burrows, which can compromise the integrity of a levee bank. Inspect 
the levee regularly, looking for signs of erosion or animal burrows. If erosion is a continuous 
problem, consider installing bank protection such as those listed below. Plantings are also a part 
of good levee control. Do not plant vegetation with long roots like willows or alfalfa. Low-
growing, spreading native grasses are the best option. If using the top of a levee as a wet weather 
road, consider paving or laying stones to prevent ruts caused by vehicles on wet ground. If leaks 
appear on the outside of the levee, consult with an engineer to resolve this problem before 
damage occurs. 
 
• Riprap or stone/broken concrete rubble. 
• Semi-porous plastic sheeting can be useful if properly installed in conjunction with 
riprap. 
• Evict any burrowing animals found and fill in their burrows. 
 
4.4.8. Sampling and Analysis. Sample analysis is one of the best ways for an operator to monitor 
the condition and efficiency of the lagoon. Not only will the data tell the operator what is going 
on in the lagoon, but when analysis results are recorded it allows the operator to predict the 
trend direction that the lagoon is going in, i.e., whether the lagoon is in a steady state or if the 
process parameters are headed in the wrong direction. This information allows the operator to 
troubleshoot the lagoon and make process adjustments before a serious problem occurs. For 
recommended sample types, frequencies, and sample locations, see Table 4.3.

4.4.8.1. Always, take samples at the same location. Take influent and effluent samples at a 
point where the flow is well mixed. Take lagoon samples at least 8 feet (2.5 m) from the 
edge and at a depth of at least 1 foot (0.3 m). Do not collect lagoon samples immediately 
after a high wind or storm because the lagoon will be temporarily agitated, and the sample 
will not be representative. Good sampling technique is important to ensure a representative 
sample every time. There are two types of samples normally collected for a lagoon system: 
 
4.4.8.1.1. Grab samples are used to measure temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and 
chlorine residual. Perform these measurements immediately after collecting the sample 
to ensure accurate results. 
 
4.4.8.1.2. Composite samples are stored in a refrigerator or ice chest until analyzed. 
Typically, personnel use composite samples to measure BOD and suspended solids. 
Sampling records also provide a measure of the treatment efficiency in the lagoon. Table 
4.4 lists some common treatment efficiency ranges. Dissolved oxygen, pH, and 
temperature are important indicators to determine lagoon conditions. BOD, coliform, and 
solids testing measure the lagoon treatment efficiency.

4.4.9. Troubleshooting System Problems. There are warning signs that indicate when a lagoon 
system may be overloaded. Use the indicators listed below and the information in Table 4.5 to 
troubleshoot and pinpoint system problems and identify potential remedies. 
 
• Obnoxious odors in the area of the lagoon.

4.5. Natural Treatment Systems O&M. Natural systems are uncomplicated, so they are often 
neglected. Most problems with natural systems are due to poor maintenance or process 
overloading. If the design and size of the system is appropriate, and the population it serves does 
not increase significantly, loading problems usually will not be an issue. The following paragraphs 
concern maintenance issues that affect the operation of various natural systems. 
 
4.5.1. Overland Flow Systems. Overland flow is the controlled application of wastewater to 
relatively impermeable soils on gentle grass covered slopes. The hydraulic loading is typically 
several inches of liquid per week and is usually higher than for most slow rate infiltration 
systems. Vegetation in the overland flow system contributes to slope stability, erosion 
protection, and treatment. The flow is normally directed through highly vegetated lands, 
populated with non-root crops, trees, or grasses. The vegetation assists in the treatment process 
by absorbing a portion of the water and the nutrients (e.g., nitrates and phosphorus), and 
provides a substrate for the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that stabilize organic 
wastes in the wastewater. These systems require an established pre-treatment system and a large 
amount of land to be successful. It is unlikely that they would be a good fit for semi-permanent 
deployments. 
 
 
122 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
4.5.1.1. If using an overland flow system: 
 
• The operator needs to be diligent in maintaining the bar screen and any other pre-
treatment systems. 
• There must be a solution in place to store or divert the flow to the overland flow 
system during times of cold weather, heavy rain or, in the case of crop grasses, during 
harvest. 
• Low-permeability soils are acceptable for siting overland flow systems. 
 
4.5.1.2. The application rate is defined as the flowrate applied to the slope per unit width of 
slope. The application rate used for the design of overland flow systems depend on the 
limiting design factor (usually BOD), the pre-application treatment, and the climate. BOD 
loading is limited to 85 pounds/acre/day (95.4 kg/hectare/day). Application periods usually 
range from 6 to 12 hours/day for 5 to 7 days/week; an 8 hour/day application period is 
typical. Occasionally, the system may be able to operate 24 hours/day for relatively short 
periods. 
 
4.5.1.3. Slope lengths in overland flow systems typically range from 100 to 200 feet. The 
longer the slope the greater the removal of BOD, TSS, and nitrogen. The recommended slope 
length depends on the method of application. For gated pipe or spray heads where the 
wastewater is applied at the top of the slope, a slope length of 120 to 150 feet is 
recommended. For high-pressure sprinkler application, the slope should be between 150 and 
200 feet. 
 
4.5.1.4. Once the vegetative cover has been established, the overland flow slopes will need 
little, if any, maintenance work. It will, however, be necessary to mow the grass periodically. 
A few systems have been operated without cutting, but the tall grass tends to interfere with 
maintenance operations. Normal practice has been to cut the grass two or three times a year. 
The first cutting may be left on the slopes. After that, however, it is desirable to remove the 
cut grass. The advantages of doing so are that additional nutrient removal is achieved and 
channeling problems may be more readily observed. Additionally, depending on local 
market conditions, cut grasses may be sole as hay to offset the cost of harvesting. 
 
4.5.1.5. Slopes should be allowed to dry sufficiently such that mowing equipment can be 
operated without leaving ruts or tracks that will later result in channeling of the flow. The 
drying time required before mowing varies with the soil and climatic conditions and can 
range from a few days to a few weeks. The downtime required for harvesting can be reduced 
by a week or more, if green chop harvesting is practiced instead of mowing, raking, and 
baling. Take care to minimize pathogens (disease-causing micro-organisms) effects on 
personnel. Local markets for green-chop should exist for this method to be considered or 
feasible. 
 
4.5.1.6. It is common for certain native grasses and weeds to begin growing on the slopes, 
but usually they have little impact on treatment efficiency, and it is generally not necessary 
to eliminate them. However, there are exceptions, consider consulting local agricultural or 
farming community for advice. Proper management of the slopes and the application 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
123 
 
 
schedule will prevent conditions conducive to mosquito breeding. Other insects are usually 
no cause for concern, although an invasion of certain pests such as army worms may be 
harmful to the vegetation and may require periodic insecticide application. 
 
4.5.2. Constructed Wetlands. Wetlands are nature’s sewage treatment plants. This pamphlet 
does not recommend nor is it usually permitted to discharge wastewater into a naturally 
occurring wetland. Primarily, this is due to the potential for environmental damage to the natural 
ecosystem; however, it is permissible and even desirable to discharge pre-treated wastewater 
into constructed wetlands designed and built specifically to treat wastewater. Constructed 
wetlands may be of either the surface flow type or subsurface flow type. The surface flow type 
has exposed water that can support mosquito breeding while the subsurface flow type does not. 
Each type of constructed wetland requires different types of vegetation, with reeds and 
bulrushes typically planted in the subsurface flow type due to their deep penetrating roots and 
stems. Cattails, sedges, rushes, reeds, and bulrushes all grow well in exposed water wetlands. 
All these plants tolerate freezing conditions and do not normally require harvesting; however, 
maintenance personnel may occasionally burn off dried grasses in surface water systems. 
 
4.5.2.1. Vegetation assists in the treatment process by: 
 
• Providing oxygen though the root systems. 
• Providing a substrate for the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that 
stabilize organic wastes in the wastewater. 
 
4.5.2.2. These systems require an established pre-treatment system and a large amount of 
land to be successful. If a constructed wetlands system is in use, the operator needs to be 
diligent in maintaining the bar screen and any other pre-treatment systems. There needs to 
be a solution in place to store or divert the flow to the constructed wetlands system during 
cold weather. Low-permeability soils are acceptable for siting constructed wetlands. BOD 
loading is limited to 100 pounds/acre/day (112 kg/hectare/day) for subsurface flow systems 
and 60 pounds/acre/day (67 kg/hectare/day) for surface flow types. Phosphorus removal in 
constructed wetlands is not significant. 
 
4.5.3. Irrigation-Based Systems. Irrigation-based systems are similar to overland flow systems 
(see paragraph 4.5.1) in that they must be preceded by pre-treatment processes and are 
dependent upon vegetation for a significant portion of treatment and nutrient uptake. Influent 
distribution occurs by sprinklers, surface application, or a drip system. These systems require 
an established pre-treatment system and a large amount of land to be successful. It is unlikely 
that they would be a good fit for semi-permanent deployments. If an irrigation-based system is 
in use, the operator needs to be diligent in maintaining the bar screen and any other pre-
treatment systems, as a high-quality influent is required to avoid plugging sprinklers or drip 
systems. A solution needs to be in place to store or divert the flow to the irrigation system 
during cold weather, heavy rain or, in the case of crops, during the harvest. Underdrains are 
often required based on soil permeability and average annual precipitation. Irrigation-based 
systems typically operate intermittently, with a feed cycle followed by a drying cycle. If 
established for use, at least two fields or some form of storage are required so that one is always 
available. 
 
124 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
4.5.4. Rapid-Infiltration Basins. Rapid-infiltration basins require soil permeability rates of 1 
inch/hour (2.5 cm/hour) or better to be successful. Very coarse sand and gravel are not 
acceptable as they allow the wastewater to pass too rapidly through the upper few feet of the 
bed where the biological reactions and stabilization take place. Soil depths to bedrock or 10 feet 
(3m) or better are also a preferred condition for siting rapid-infiltration basins. These systems 
require an established pre-treatment system to be successful. If an infiltration basin is in use, 
the operator needs to be diligent in maintaining the bar screen and any other pre-treatment 
systems, as a high-quality influent is required to reduce soil clogging and prevent nuisance 
odors. A solution needs to be in place to store or divert the flow to allow for soil reaeration 
between applications. Multiple basins are normally necessary to support this requirement. 
Typically, operators feed primary effluent to an infiltration basin for one to two days, with a 
five- to seven-day rest or drying period (in the summer) between applications. Recommend a 
seven- to twelve-day range for winter drying periods. Underdrains are often required when 
controlling comingling of the percolate and groundwater. Personnel can successfully operate 
rapid-infiltration basins in freezing conditions. See Table 4.6 for performance data for rapid-
infiltration basins.

4.5.5. Sampling and Analysis. Sample analysis is one of the best ways for an operator to monitor 
the condition and efficiency of natural land treatment systems. Not only will the data indicate 
what is going on in the process but if the results are recorded it allows the operator to predict 
the trend direction that the process is going in, i.e., whether the process is in a steady state or if 
the process parameters are headed in the wrong direction. This information allows the operator 
to troubleshoot the process and make process adjustments before a serious upset occurs. Always 
take samples at the same location. Take influent and effluent samples at a point where the flow 
is well mixed. Take aquatic pool samples at least 8 feet (2.5 m) from the edge and at a depth of 
at least 1 foot (0.3 m). Do not collect pool samples immediately after a high wind or storm as 
the pool may be temporarily agitated and the sample will not be representative. Good sampling 
technique is important to ensure a representative sample every time. Sampling records also 
provide a measure of the treatment’s efficiency. Dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature testing 
are important indicators to determine process conditions. BOD, coliform, and solids testing 
measure the process treatment efficiency. 
 
4.5.6. Troubleshooting System Problems. There are warning signs that indicate when a natural-
based system is overloaded. Consider using the indicators listed below and the information in 
Table 4.7, as a troubleshooting tool to pinpoint system problems and identify potential 
remedies.

4.5.7. Routine Maintenance Checks. Thorough daily inspections to identify treatment system 
problems and gather data to make operating decisions are recommended as part of routine 
monitoring. Because land application treatment is a biological process, it is somewhat 
unpredictable, and observations used to adjust management according to actual field conditions 
are important. Table 4.8 lists examples of routine inspection and maintenance checks that may 
help guide daily inspections of land application sites.

4.6. Recirculating Sand Filter O&M. Recirculating sand filters can produce a high-quality 
effluent with 85 to 95 percent BOD and TSS removal. Operators develop the dosing rates based 
upon performance and may adjust them for significant flow variations. Recirculating sand filters 
require routine service inspections, but the complexity of the maintenance tasks is usually minimal. 
The primary tasks are monitoring the quality of the influent and effluent, inspecting the dosing 
system, maintaining the filter surface, checking the discharge orifices, and flushing the discharge 
manifold. Keep the surface of the sand bed weed-free. In addition, inspect the recirculation tank 
and perform routine maintenance on the pre-treatment system(s) (i.e., the septic tank). Consider 
installing a quick-disconnect coupling on the submersible pump in the recirculation tank for easy 
removal. Also, keep a spare pump available in case the installed pump fails. See Table 4.9 for a 
summary of recirculating sand filter maintenance tasks.

4.7. Commercial Treatment Systems O&M. Commercial treatment systems are often called 
“package plants.” While the activated sludge process is not a proprietary product, many 
manufacturers of package plants develop unique process features and/or equipment that may be 
trademark- protected. For this reason, suppliers have their own unique operating requirements. 
Suppliers will provide the owner/operator of a proprietary system with printed copies of the O&M 
instructions for that unit. In addition, suppliers often provide operator training as part of the 
purchased package. Keep O&M instructions where users can consult them as needed and file for 
future use. Consult the proprietary system instructions for O&M information relating to the 
installed system. 
 
4.7.1. Biological Process Startup. Of the various biological treatment processes, they all have 
one common element: they utilize microorganisms to remove organic constituents 
(contaminants) from wastewater. These microorganisms occur naturally in wastewater but in 
insufficient numbers to provide treatment. Certain conditions are necessary to encourage 
growth of these microorganisms and thus support treatment in a process tank. Accomplish this 
in one of two ways: by seeding or by developing a population of microorganisms from scratch. 
In either case, the following conditions are required for the success of biological treatment: 
 
• Adequate supply of oxygen for the microorganisms. 
• Adequate nutrients (food) to support growth of the microorganism population. 
• Mixing in the reactor to bring the oxygen and food in contact with the microorganisms. 
 
4.7.2. Seeded Startup. Seeding is the fastest and easiest method for bringing a new biological 
process online or for rejuvenating an existing process that has undergone a process upset that 
killed all or most of the microorganisms. A nearby source of mixed liquor or activated sludge 
is an essential part of a seeded startup. A seeded startup is impossible without the ability to 
import existing mixed liquor into the facility. Assuming the seed is available, a basic procedure 
for a seeded start is as follows: 
128 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
 
4.7.2.1. Fill (or nearly fill) the reactor with water (if not already filled). 
 
4.7.2.2. Aerate the contents of the reactor until the dissolved oxygen is at least 2.0 mg/L. 
Aerating over 4.0 mg/L is a waste of energy and will not help the process (more is not better). 
If there is a separate method of mixing the reactor, other than introducing air, start it now. 
 
4.7.2.3. Introduce raw wastewater or pretreatment (septic tank) effluent concurrently with 
the seed sludge. How much seed to use? Any amount is better than nothing is, but as most 
seed will be around 10,000 mg/L in concentration, the volume of seed added does not exceed 
2,000 mg/L suspended solids concentration in the reactor(s). An easy calculation is to 
multiply the ADF by 8.34 x 0.02 ÷ 8.34. For a 3,000-gpd plant, this would equal 60 gallons 
of seed. 
 
4.7.2.4. Note that the existing dissolved oxygen will be consumed when adding organic 
wastes and microorganisms to the reactor. Monitor the dissolved oxygen closely at this time 
and adjust the aeration rate as required to maintain 2.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen concentration. 
 
4.7.2.5. It is not necessary to fill the clarifier (if present) completely prior to startup, one-
quarter to one-third of the volume is fine. Once the reactor effluent begins to enter the 
clarifier, start the collector mechanism. 
 
4.7.2.6. Whatever means of recirculating the reactor effluent mixed liquor, begin doing so at 
a rate of 1.5 times the influent flow as soon as it is possible to do so. 
 
4.7.2.7. Measure dissolved oxygen and MLSS at least twice a day—twice per shift, if 
possible. Maintain the dissolved oxygen at 2.0 mg/L and monitor the MLSS. 
 
4.7.2.8. When the MLSS nears 2,000 mg/L, reduce the recirculation rate back to whatever 
the design rate is for your process. 
 
4.7.2.9. Increasing the mixed liquor concentration to 2,000 mg/L MLSS (typically, the 
minimum required for an extended-aeration WWTF) will take anywhere from two to five 
days, depending on the following factors: 
 
• Amount and concentration of seed used. 
• Strength of the reactor influent. 
• Temperature of the reactor contents. 
• Maintaining dissolved oxygen and adequate mixing in the reactor. 
 
4.7.3. Unseeded Startup. The steps for an unseeded startup, or restart, are the same except there 
is no seed. Because there is no seed, it will take from one to three weeks to develop a population 
of microorganisms at the design concentration, dependent upon the strength of the reactor 
influent and the temperature of the process. The task of the operator is to oversee the process to 
ensure they keep the variables they can control within normal limits and to monitor the progress 
of biological growth within the reactor. 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
129 
 
 
4.8. Pumping Systems O&M. Most of the processes used to treat wastewater at semi-permanent 
contingency locations rely upon gravity flow and do not involve pumps. Where pumps are required 
a source of electricity is required, which is not always present in sufficient quantities in remotely 
located deployments. There are many types of pumps, but the most prevalent type used in small 
wastewater treatment systems is the centrifugal pump. 
 
4.8.1. Centrifugal pumps convert the energy of a rotating electric motor or engine into kinetic 
energy (velocity) and pressure. The pump consists of a rotating impeller and a stationary volute 
or casing. The pump moves liquid by the impeller spinning at high speed (usually from 1,200 
to 3,350 revolutions per minute [rpm]), accelerating the liquid to a high velocity. The rapidly 
moving liquid leaves the pump volute through the discharge nozzle under pressure. As it leaves, 
an area of low-pressure forms at the inlet nozzle, thus drawing in more fluid to continue the 
cycle. Most centrifugal pumps will not “lift” fluid but must be primed. Operators typically 
accomplish this by locating the pump so that the suction is flooded. 
 
4.8.2. Centrifugal pumps are relatively simple to operate and maintain. It is important not to 
operate a dry pump for more than a few minutes and never run the pump for more than a few 
minutes against a closed discharge valve—this can heat the water in the volute to the point 
where steam is created, which can cause the volute to explode. Personnel should consult the 
manufacturer’s O&M manual for maintenance requirements for a specific pump. For general 
pump troubleshooting, see Table 4.10.

4.9. Disinfection O&M. A routine operation and maintenance schedule should be developed and 
implemented for any disinfection system. The following paragraphs address O&M for UV 
radiation and chlorine tablet disinfection systems. Certain information was adapted from the EPA 
Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet, Disinfection for Small Systems. Find this and other EPA 
wastewater treatment system publications at https://search.epa.gov/epasearch/epasearch. 
 
4.9.1. UV Radiation. A proper O&M program for a UV disinfection system should ensure that 
sufficient UV radiation is transmitted to the organisms to inactivate them. The following are 
typical O&M considerations for UV disinfection systems: 
 
• Regular inspection and maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer. 
• Replacing the lamps as recommended by the manufacturer, generally annually or when 
output has decreased to 70 percent efficiency. 
• A regular program of water monitoring for turbidity and color. 
 
4.9.1.1. Cleaning. Cleaning frequency is site-specific. All surfaces between the UV radiation 
and the target organisms must be cleaned, while ballasts, lamps, and the reactor must be 
functioning properly. Inadequate cleaning is one of the most common causes of ineffective 
UV systems. The quartz sleeves or Teflon tubes should be cleaned regularly, either manually 
or through mechanical methods. Common cleaning methods include mechanical wipers, 
ultrasonic baths, or chemicals. Chemical cleaning is commonly performed with citric acid 
or commercially available cleaning solutions. Other cleaning agents include mild vinegar 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
131 
 
 
solutions and sodium hydrosulfite. A combination of cleaning agents should be tested to find 
those that are most suitable for the specific wastewater characteristics without producing 
harmful or toxic by-products. Non-contact reactor systems are most effectively cleaned with 
sodium hydrosulfite. 
 
4.9.1.2. Lamp Replacement. Average lamp life ranges from 8,760 to 14,000 working hours 
(between approximately 12 and 18 months of continuous use), but lamps are usually replaced 
after 12,000 hours of use. Operating procedures should be set to reduce the on/off cycles of 
the lamps, because repeated cycles reduce their effectiveness. In addition, spare UV lamps 
should be always kept on hand along with accurate records of lamp use and replacement. 
The UV output gradually decreases over the life of the lamp and the lamp must be replaced 
based on the hours of use or a UV monitor. 
 
4.9.1.2.1. The quartz sleeves that fit over the lamps will last about 5 to 8 years but are 
generally replaced every 5 years. 
 
4.9.1.2.2. The ballast must be compatible with the lamps and should be ventilated to 
prevent excessive heating, which may shorten its life or even result in fires. The life cycle 
of ballasts is approximately 10 to 15 years, but they are usually replaced every 10 years.  
 
4.9.2. Tablet Chlorination. Follow manufacturer’s recommendations and test/calibrate 
equipment according to the maintenance instructions. The following are common O&M 
considerations and activities for a tablet chlorinator: 
 
• Use only wastewater-approved chlorine contact tablets. 
• Inspect at least two times per week to ensure the chlorinator contains tablets at all times. 
• Tablets can become blocked in the tube; check for and remove blockages during 
inspection. 
• To reduce the risk of blockages, do not add more than five tablets at a time. 
• Use a chlorine test kit to determine the chlorine concentration in the storage reservoir; 
insufficient chlorine or septic odors indicate a blockage or insufficient chlorine contact. 
 
4.9.2.1. Cleaning. Disassemble and clean system components, including meters and floats, 
every six months. Inspect and clean valves and springs annually. Remove iron and 
manganese deposits with muriatic acid or other removal agents. 
 
4.9.2.2. Chemical Storage. It is essential to store all chemical disinfectants properly and 
safely when using chlorine. The storage of chlorine is strongly dependent on the compound 
phase. Heat, light, storage time, and impurities such as iron accelerate the degradation of 
sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hypochlorite is unstable under normal atmospheric conditions 
and should be stored in a dry location. Hypochlorites are destructive to wood, corrosive to 
most common metals, and will irritate skin and eyes if there is contact. For further details on 
the safe use and storage of chlorine refer to the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for the specific 
chemicals of interest. SDSs are readily available from the internet by doing a search on the 
chemical name.

4.10. Residuals Management. Regardless of the type of system, no wastewater treatment process 
is capable of continuous operation without experiencing some type of residuals buildup. Removal 
and disposal of these residuals is a very important and sometimes neglected part of system O&M. 
Disposing of residuals collected or precipitated during the operation of wastewater treatment 
facilities is one of the most problematic and important factors in the operation of a wastewater 
treatment facility. The residuals personnel will most likely encounter when operating the types of 
systems described in this publication fall into two groups: screenings and sludge. Screenings off 
bar racks (typically collected manually in systems of the size and type described herein) need to 
be disposed of as soon as possible after collection or briefly stored in a secure, covered container 
until disposal. Units normally dispose of screenings by burial, either in a nearby trench or at a 
designated landfill. Regardless, carry out collection and disposal of screenings in such a way as to 
preclude providing a source of obnoxious odors or a food or breeding source for rats and noxious 
insects. Sludge consists of settled solids that vary in consistency from a free-flowing liquid (e.g., 
settled solids and scum removed from a septic tank) to a semi-solid, mud-like substance dredged 
from lagoons or drying beds. Transport liquid sludge to nearby wastewater treatment plants for 
disposal or dewater and dispose of in landfills. For remote contingency locations, a local WWTF 
may not be available. In this case, dewatering the septage in an onsite sludge-drying bed may be 
necessary prior to disposal. In addition to the landfill disposal option, consider using dewatered or 
semi-solid sludge as a fertilizer or soil supplement, depending upon its content and local 
conditions. Plow in sludge applied to agricultural land as soon as possible following application. 
 
4.10.1. Sludge Drying Beds. Dewatering in a sludge drying bed occurs by evaporation from the 
surface of the sludge and draining from the lower layers of the sludge. Leachate is the name 
given to liquid draining from the sludge. Since most of the water removed from the sludge is 
by evaporation, sludge-drying beds work best in warm, arid, and semi-arid climates. Under 
favorable conditions, sludge can achieve a moisture content of 60 percent in 10 to 15 days. 
Sludge in drying beds exposed to precipitation will take longer to reach the desired solids 
content. Covering the drying bed with a roof, plastic, or glass will improve performance, while 
still allowing air to circulate. Transparent covers, such as plastic or glass, allows more sunlight 
and may shorten drying time. Table 4.11 lists typical advantages and disadvantages of drying 
beds. 
 
Table 4.11. Sludge Drying Beds Advantages and Disadvantages. 
 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
Low cost 
Low maintenance requirements 
A high dried solids-content product 
The dried product may be landfilled or buried 
Relatively high space requirements 
Potential odors 
Attraction of pests 
Manual removal of dried sludge 
 
4.10.2. Sludge Drying Bed Construction. The illustration in Figure 4.4 is a diagram of an 
excavated sludge drying bed. Construct the bottom of the drying bed above the groundwater 
table. In cases where leachate contamination of groundwater is dangerous to public health or 
otherwise undesirable (for example, near a water supply well), consider providing a concrete or 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
133 
 
 
impervious membrane floor as the base of the sludge drying bed. If using impervious floors, 
position underdrains above the floor. The following are the design requirements for 
underdrains: 
 
• Plastic, ductile iron, or cast-iron pipe. 
• Perforated pipe. 
• No less than 4 inches (100 mm) in diameter. 
• Minimum slope of 1 percent. 
• Spaced 8 to 20 feet (2.5 to 6 m) apart. 
 
Figure 4.4. Excavated Sludge Drying Bed. 
 
 
 
4.10.2.1. Since the leachate collected by the underdrain may be pathogenic and have 
biochemical and chemical oxygen demands, the underdrain should flow back to the 
wastewater treatment system or septic tank. In climates with significant precipitation, it may 
be advantageous to cover the bed to prevent rainwater from infiltrating back to the treatment 
mechanism. 
 
4.10.2.2. Backfill underdrains with gravel. This layer ranges from 8 to 18 inches (200 to 450 
mm) deep. Gravel particles range from 0.1 to 1 inch (3 to 25 mm) in diameter. The coarser 
materials are at the bottom of this layer. Above the gravel layer, there is a sand layer. The 
following are the design requirements for the sand layer: 
 
• 12 to 18 inches (305 to 460 mm) deep. 
• Sand needs to be clean, free from clay, dust, loam, or other foreign matter. 
• Sand grains need to be between 0.01 and 0.03 inch (0.3 to 0.75 mm) in diameter. 
 
 
134 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
4.10.2.3. Consider that some sand will be lost during dried sludge removal operations and 
will require replacement. Provide a splash slab of durable material about 3 to 5 inches (7.5 
to 13 cm) thick and 3 ft2 (0.3 m2) to receive sludge being decanted and prevent erosion of 
the sand surface. 
 
4.10.2.4. Construct sidewalls of concrete or wood (use treated wood to prevent rotting). 
Figure 4.5 shows a field of concrete-walled sludge drying beds. The sidewalls can extend 
20 to 36 inches (0.5 to 0.9 m) above the surface of the sand layer and extend to the bottom 
of the sludge drying bed. Alternatively, where simple, nonpermanent construction is used, 
the sludge drying bed may be an excavation with sloped sides. If leachate contamination of 
the groundwater is a concern, the impervious membrane liner can be continuous and cover 
the sloped excavation sides. 
 
Figure 4.5. Concrete Walled Sludge Drying Beds. 
 
 
 
4.10.2.5. In the case of larger sludge drying beds, consider providing partitions to isolate 
sections of the bed and allow alternating use. Partitions can be constructed of similar material 
to the sidewalls and extend 3 to 4 inches (75 to 100 mm) below the top of the sand layer. If 
using posts to support wooden partitions, extend the posts 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) below 
the bottom of the gravel layer. Locate open sludge drying beds about 300 feet (100 m) from 
inhabited areas to avoid odor complaints. 
 
4.10.3. Sludge Drying Bed Operation and Maintenance. Typically, fresh sludge can cause 
disease (pathogenic), so personnel should handle it with care. Transport sludge directly to 
drying beds using pumps or via a pump truck. Apply sludge in 3- to 12-inch (7 to 30 cm) layers. 
If the sludge tends to separate from the liquid, consider drawing off the clear liquid at the top. 
Allow the sludge to dry until it achieves the desired solids concentration. This will vary by 
climate and location; sludge can achieve a moisture content of 60 percent in 10 to 15 days, 
under favorable conditions. Accelerate the drying process by breaking up the dry, crusty layer 
at the top with a shovel or auger. Sludge will continue to dry during periods of freeze-thaw 
cycling. Sludge should be dry to moist and crumbly (not wet) when removed. Remove dried 
sludge with mechanical equipment or shovels and wheelbarrows. If transporting removed 
sludge with trucks, make provisions to allow trucks to drive alongside the beds. Do not drive 
trucks on the beds. Replace any sand removed during dried sludge removal and apply sludge.

4.10.4. Sludge Drying Bed Design Calculation. Size sludge drying beds based on the number 
of individuals they will serve. Generally, it is assumed that 1 to 1.5 ft2 of drying area is required 
per person (see Metcalf & Eddy, Wastewater Engineering, Treatment and Reuse). See Table 
4.12 for an example calculation. 
 
Table 4.12. Example Sludge Drying Bed Design Calculation. 
 
Example: 
Size a sludge drying bed for a facility with a wastewater treatment system sized for 
3000 gal/day. 
Solution: 
Using a 40 gpd/person from Table 2.27, 3000 gal/day ÷ 40 gal/person/day = 75 people 
75 people x 1.5 ft2/person = 113 ft2 
The sludge drying bed is sized as follows: 
Use 120 ft2 or 10 feet x 12 feet for ease of construction or two 6-foot x 10-foot beds 
for ease of access 
 
4.11. Closing Wastewater Treatment Facilities. Once leaders make the decision to transition to 
permanent facilities, or cease expeditionary operations, units can usually close temporary 
sanitation facilities, including wastewater treatment units and systems. Eliminating and properly 
decommissioning such facilities will reduce the risk of exposure to personnel and the environment. 
 
4.11.1. Usually, the lead Service is responsible for closing onsite wastewater treatment facilities 
and other environmental systems. When host nation entities express interest in keeping these 
facilities, CE assists with transfer of the sites and infrastructure in accordance with theater and 
CCMD requirements. This is particularly crucial in areas such as the US Central Command 
(CENTCOM) area of operations where we frequently downsize, close, or return non-enduring 
contingency locations to host nations. During site closures, mitigation of adverse environmental 
impacts may be required by international agreement or combatant commander policy. 
Commanders can use environmental surveys and condition reports conducted prior to and 
throughout site occupation to mitigate environmental hazards that present danger to human 
health and safety. Contact the CCDR’s environmental staff for guidance on site closure and 
environmental mitigation policies. The Environmental Officer and staff also assists with site 
closure and transfer. 
 
4.11.2. Typically, closure plans for WWTFs are based on site-specific information. The closure 
plans may address concerns relating to potential migration of residual waste constituents to 
environmental media, including groundwater, surface water, and the atmosphere. Further, 
closure plans for certain land treatment components may address the extent of degradation, 
transformation, and immobilization of constituents within a defined treatment zone, or the 
pathways of migration of hazardous waste constituents into the environmental media. The 
following sections provide general considerations for closure of wastewater treatment units and 
systems. Be sure to follow theater, CCMD, and AF requirements and procedures for your 
contingency location. 
 
136 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
4.11.3. Site Closure Considerations. Environmental considerations and standards addressed in 
site closure plans generally attempt to control, minimize, or eliminate post-closure escape of 
hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, leachate, contaminated run-off, or hazardous waste 
decomposition products. If sampling and analysis is done during the initial Environmental 
Baseline Survey, the same is usually accomplished for the environmental closure report. 
Consider the following potential actions when performing sit closure for certain wastewater 
treatment systems and units: 
 
4.11.3.1. Septic Tanks and Leach Fields. When removing septic tank contents and tanks, 
take care to avoid spillage and movement of fluids containing contaminants into 
underground sources of drinking water. If closing several septic systems at the contingency 
location, consider phasing out and closing individual systems as the population decreases. 
In addition, consider using contractor-supported portable toilets, burnout latrines, or other 
expedient latrines for the last few days or weeks at the location. Septic system closure may 
include the following procedures: 
 
• Locate drain lines, distribution boxes, septic tank(s), and dosing tank(s). 
• Remove contents from drains and drain lines. 
• Cap or plug influent sewer line. 
• Pump and remove septage (sewage sludge, grease, and sediment) from septic tank(s). 
• Dispose of septage appropriately (local WWTF, landfill, sludge drying bed, etc.). 
• Remove septic tank(s) and visually check the tank for indications of cracks or leaks, 
and any visibly or potentially contaminated soil in the vicinity. 
• Complete sampling and analysis regiment as required by environmental guidance. 
• Remove and dispose of contaminated soil, if required. 
• Remove and/or fill dosing tanks and distribution boxes. 
• Cap or plug effluent outlets to leach fields. 
• Remove all pumps, piping, and valves of treatment system. 
• Backfill all holes with compacted earth, sand, gravel, or other approved material. 
 
4.11.3.2. Lagoons and Ponds. Depending on the specific closure plan, requirements may 
involve removing everything from the lagoon and restoring the original site topography, or 
removing all standing wastewater from the lagoon, stabilizing the bio-solids (remaining 
wastes, waste residues and contaminated materials), and backfilling the basin. These two 
closure options and their associated actions are included in the list below. 
 
• Cap or plug influent sewer line. 
• Remove or drain wastewater from the lagoon. 
• Pump wastewater to local treatment facility or receiving system or, 
• Allow lagoon to stabilize with no additional inflow for a period not less than the 
design detention time of the lagoon and drain into the receiving stream according to 
requirements and conditions (at a rate not exceeding the maximum design flow of 
the lagoon). 
• Allow solid accumulation (sludge) on the bottom of lagoon to dry. 
• Apply disinfectant, mix dried sludge with soil, and leave on the bottom of lagoon or 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
137 
 
 
remove for disposal in a landfill or other approved method or, 
• Stabilize the sludge on the bottom of lagoon through lime treatment or in-place 
composting (this is desirable to reduce odors and the presence of pathogenic 
organisms). 
• Remove all mechanical equipment, piping, and valves, and liner materials (e.g., 
plastic and clay liners) from the lagoon(s) and disposed of in an approved manner. 
• Backfill lagoon, compact soil, and cap above the existing grade. 
• Consider seeding to prevent ponding and erosion. 
 
4.11.3.3. Wastewater Treatment Package Plants. Package plants typically include 
prefabricated factory assembled units and other modular type units designed for the 
treatment of wastewater through activated sludge processes and modifications. The main 
closure consideration is usually the disposal of generated sludge. Consider the following 
procedures when closing package plants. 
 
• Sever and cap the influent line entering the wastewater treatment plant. 
• Remove all wastewater and septage (sewage sludge, grease, and sediment) from the 
plant. 
• Dispose of wastewater and septage at a permitted treatment plant or land applied 
under the proper conditions and requirements. 
• Dismantle and remove all piping, mechanical, and electrical equipment from the site 
(some of these items can be recycled, salvaged, or reused). 
• Dispose of items that cannot be recycled, salvaged, or reused at a permitted landfill. 
• Demolish plant basins and treat concrete as clean fill or leave onsite. 
• Crack the floor of basins left onsite so they cannot hold water and fill with clean-fill 
material. 
 
4.11.3.4. Sewage Sludge. Sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants can be managed 
as a liquid (2 percent solids) or a cake (15 to 20 percent solids) depending on the dewatering 
equipment available. Common sewage sludge disposal options for contingency locations 
include municipal sewage systems, municipal landfills, land application of non-stabilized 
sludge, and composting. Refer to paragraph 4.10 for information on managing residuals. 
 
4.11.3.5. Chemicals. Chemicals used and stored at WWTFs should be disposed of according 
to the Safety Data Sheet or relocated for use elsewhere. Safety Data Sheets can be found 
online but should be stored with the chemicals. 
 
4.11.3.6. Recycling Media Filters. This wastewater treatment system includes recirculating 
sand filters, gravel filters, and other types of media. Consider the following actions when 
closing recycling media filters. 
 
• Sever and cap the influent line entering the wastewater treatment plant. 
• Remove all wastewater and septage (sewage sludge, grease, and sediment) from the 
plant. 
• Dispose of wastewater and septage at a permitted treatment plant or land applied 
under the proper conditions and requirements.

requirements. 
• Dispose of larger sand and gravel at a permitted landfill. 
• Leave larger rocks in basin, wash using pressure washer, and dispose of as clean fill. 
• Allow wash water to drain into recirculation tank and dispose of at permitted 
treatment plant. 
• Crack the floor of basins left onsite so they cannot hold water and fill with clean-fill 
material.

Terms 
 
Absorption—The process by which one substance is taken into and included within another 
substance, such as the absorption of water by soil or nutrients by plants. 
Activated Sludge Process—A biological wastewater treatment process in which active sludge is 
agitated and aerated with incoming wastewater to promote treatment. The activated sludge is 
subsequently separated from the treated wastewater (mixed liquor) by settling, and most is 
recycled to the process. 
Adsorption—The increased concentration of molecules or ions at a surface, including 
exchangeable cations and anions on soil particles. The adherence of a dissolved solid to the surface 
of a solid. 
144 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
Advanced Wastewater Treatment—Treatment beyond the secondary or biological stage of 
treatment. It includes removing nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen and a high percentage 
of suspended solids. It is also often called tertiary treatment. 
Aeration—The process of exposing wastewater to circulating air to assist biological treatment. 
Aerobic—Refers to life or processes that require the presence of free elemental oxygen. Typically 
the dissolved oxygen is greater than 1.0 mg/L. 
Aerobic Treatment Unit (ATU)—A mechanical treatment unit that provides secondary 
wastewater treatment by mixing air (oxygen) and aerobic and facultative bacteria with the 
wastewater. ATUs typically use a suspended growth treatment process (similar to activated sludge 
extended aeration) or a fixed film treatment process (similar to trickling filter). 
Ammonia Nitrogen—Ammonia or ammonium form of nitrogen in raw sewage that is converted 
in the nitrification process. The majority of the organic nitrogen contained in raw sewage is 
converted to ammonia and/or ammonium while travelling through the sewer pipe. 
Anaerobic—Refers to life or processes that require the absence of free elemental oxygen. 
Anoxic—Refers to processes that require low oxygen concentrations (less than 0.5 mg/L) such as 
the denitrification process where the bacteria utilize the oxygen in the nitrate molecule (NO3) to 
complete the reaction and thus release nitrogen gas. 
Areal— Adjective, of or relating to or involving an area.  
Assimilation—Aerobic microbes consume the nutrients in the wastewater. 
Bacteria—Bacteria are single-cell microscopic organisms that grow in nearly every environment. 
In wastewater treatment, they can perform a variety of biological treatment processes. 
Basal—Adjective, of, at, or forming the base. 
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)—A commonly used gross measurement of the 
concentration of biodegradable organic impurities in wastewater. The amount of oxygen, 
expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L), required by bacteria while stabilizing, digesting, or

FIELD-EXPEDIENT SOIL TESTING METHODS 
 
A4.1. Field Identification of Soils. Using field-expedient testing to assess soil properties and 
classify soil material may be necessary during the initial stages of a contingency operation. Field-
testing methods include, visual examinations, plasticity tests, and sedimentation tests. Each of 
these tests provide insight into the potential engineering behavior of the soil tested. 
 
A4.2. Visual Examinations. The visual examination should establish the color, grain sizes, grain 
shapes of the coarse-grained portion, approximate gradation, and some properties of the 
undisturbed soil. 
 
A4.2.1. Color. Color helps to identify and distinguish between various soil types. It may also 
indicate the presence of certain chemicals, minerals, or impurities. Describe the color of the 
sample when initially taken in the field at the as-sampled water content, because the color may 
change with changes in water content. Include the apparent moisture content at the time of 
identification (Table A4.1). Colors generally become darker as the moisture content increases 
and lighter as the soil dries. Some fine-grained soil with dark, drab shades of brown or gray, 
including almost black, contain organic material. In contrast, clean, bright shades of gray, olive 
green, brown, red, yellow, and white are associated with inorganic soils. Gray-blue or gray-and 
yellow mottled colors frequently result from poor drainage. Red, yellow, and yellowish-brown 
result from the presence of iron oxides. White to pink may indicate considerable silica, calcium 
carbonate, or aluminum compounds. 
 
Table A4.1. Water Content of Soil. 
 
Description 
Conditions 
Dry 
No sign of water and soil is dry to touch 
Moist 
Signs of water and soil is relatively dry to touch 
Wet 
Signs of water and soil is definitely wet to touch; granular 
soil exhibits some free water when densified 
 
A4.2.2. Grain size. Establish the maximum particle size of each soil sample to determine the 
upper limit of the gradation curve. Gravels range down to the size of peas; sands start just below 
this size and decrease until the individual grains are just distinguishable by the naked eye. Silt 
and clay particles are indistinguishable as individual particles. 
 
A4.2.3. Grain shape. The shape of individual grains in a soil mass plays an important role in 
the engineering characteristics (strength and stability) of the soil. Two general shapes are 
normally recognized, bulky and platy. Platy shaped grains (clay and silt) are virtually 
indistinguishable to the naked eye. Visible bulky-shaped grains have five subdivisions as 
described below and illustrated in Figure A4.1. 
 
• Angular particles have jagged projections, sharp ridges, and flat surfaces. Such particles 
156 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
are seldom found in nature, because physical and chemical weathering processes usually 
wear off the sharp ridges in a relatively short period time. Angular material is usually 
produced artificially, by crushing. 
 
• Sub-angular particles have been weathered to the extent that the sharper points and 
ridges have been worn off. 
 
• Sub-rounded particles have been weathered to a further degree than sub-angular 
particles. They are still somewhat irregular in shape but have no sharp corners and few 
flat areas. Materials with this shape are frequently found in streambeds.  
 
• Rounded particles have all projections removed with few irregularities in shape 
remaining. The particles resemble spheres and are of varying sizes. Rounded particles 
are usually found in or near streambeds or beaches. 
 
• Well-rounded particles are rounded particles in which the few remaining irregularities 
have been removed. Like rounded particles, well-rounded particles are also usually 
found in or near streambeds or beaches. 
 
Figure A4.1. Bulky Grain-Shaped Particles. 
 
A4.2.4. Grain size distribution. Examining a dry sample spread on a flat surface can make an 
approximate identification. Pulverize all lumps until individual grains are exposed, but not 
broken. Recommend using a rubber-faced or wooden pestle and a mixing bowl, but mashing 
the sample underfoot on a smooth surface will suffice for an approximate identification. 
Separate the larger grains (gravels and some sands) by picking them out individually. Examine 
the remainder of the soil and estimate the proportions of visible individual particles and fines 
(Figure A4.2). Convert these estimates into percentages by weight of the total sample. If the 
fines exceed 50 percent, consider the soil fine-grained. If the coarse material exceeds 50 
percent, the soil is coarse-grained. Examine coarse-grained soil for gradation of the particle 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
157 
 
 
sizes from the largest to the smallest. A good distribution of all sizes means the soil is well 
graded. Overabundance or lack of any size means the material is poorly graded.  
 
Figure A4.2. Grain Size Distribution. 
 
A4.2.5. Undisturbed soil properties. Characteristics of the soil in the undisturbed state may 
be helpful in identification. The compactness of gravels or sands may be loose, medium, or 
dense. Clays may be hard, stiff, or soft. Record the ease or difficulty of sample removal. The 
moisture content of the soil influences the in-place characteristics. It is helpful to know the 
weather just prior to and during the field evaluation to determine how the soil has reacted or 
will react to weather changes. The presence of decayed roots, leaves, grasses, and other 
vegetable matter in organic soils produces soil which is usually dark when moist, having a soft 
spongy feel and a distinctive odor of rotting organic matter. The odor may be musky and slightly 
offensive. The odor is especially apparent in undisturbed conditions or in fresh samples. The 
odor becomes less obvious as the sample is exposed to air. Make the odor stronger by heating 
a wet sample. 
 
A4.3. Plasticity Tests. Fine-grained soil particles are generally not classified using gradation 
criteria but primarily by characteristics related to plasticity. Expedient field tests can help 
determine the cohesive and plastic characteristics of fine-grained soil. Except where noted, these 
tests are performed on material passing the No. 40 sieve, and include the breaking or dry strength 
test, roll or thread test, ribbon test, wet shaking test, cast test, wash test, bite or grit test, shine test, 
feel test, and sedimentation test. 
 
A4.3.1. Breaking or dry strength test. Prepare a pat of soil about 2 inches in diameter and 0.5 
inch thick by molding it in a wet, plastic state. Allow the pat to dry completely (in the sun, in 
an oven, or inside the engine compartment), then grasp the pat between the thumbs and 
forefingers of both hands and attempt to break it. If the pat breaks, try to powder it by rubbing 
it between the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Note: Dry pats of highly plastic clays often 
display shrinkage cracks. Breaking the pat along such a crack may not give a true indication of 
the strength. It is important to distinguish between a break along such a crack and a clean, fresh 
158 
 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
break that indicates the true dry strength of the soil. If the: 
 
• Pat cannot be broken nor powdered by finger pressure, it is a very highly plastic soil 
• Pat can be broken with great effort, but cannot be powdered, it is a highly plastic soil 
• Pat can be broken and powdered, but with some effort, it is a medium plastic soil 
• Pat breaks easily and powders readily, it is a slightly plastic soil 
• Pat has little or no dry strength and crumbles or powders when picked up, it is a non-
plastic soil 
 
A4.3.2. Roll or thread test. Mix a representative portion of the sample with water until you 
can mold or shape it without it sticking to your fingers. Describe this moisture content as being 
just below the sticky limit. Prepare a nonabsorbent rolling surface by placing a sheet of glass 
or heavy wax paper on a flat or level support, then shape the sample into an elongated cylinder 
and rapidly roll the prepared soil cylinder on the surface into a thread approximately 0.125 inch 
in diameter. If the moist soil rolls into a thread, it has some plasticity. The number of times you 
can roll it into a thread without crumbling is a measure of the degree of plasticity. The higher 
the soil is on the plasticity chart, the stiffer the threads are as they dry out and the tougher the 
lumps are if the soil is remolded after rolling. Soils that cannot be rolled are non-plastic. Note: 
Micaceous silts and sands can be rolled due to the flaky nature of the mica. The wet shaking 
test is the only way to distinguish this property. If the: 
 
• Soil can be molded into a ball or cylinder and deformed under very firm finger pressure 
without crumbling or cracking, it is high plasticity 
• Soil can be molded, but it cracks or crumbles under finger pressure, it is medium 
plasticity 
• Soil cannot be lumped into a ball or cylinder without breaking up, it is low plasticity 
• Soil forms a soft, spongy ball or thread when molded, it is an organic material 
• Soil cannot be rolled into a thread at any moisture content, it is a non-plastic soil 
 
A4.3.3. Ribbon test. Prepare a soil sample as in the roll or thread test. Form a roll of soil about 
0.5 to 0.75 inch in diameter and 3 to 5 inches long. Lay the roll across the palm of one hand 
(palm up) and starting at one end, squeeze the roll between the thumb and forefinger over the 
edge of the hand to form a flat unbroken ribbon about 0.125 to 0.25 inch thick. Allow the ribbon 
as formed to hang free and unsupported. Continue squeezing and handling the roll carefully to 
form the maximum length of ribbon that can be supported only by the cohesive properties of 
the soil. If the: 
 
• Sample holds together for a length of 8 to 10 inches without breaking; it is highly plastic 
and highly compressive 
• Soil can be ribboned only with difficulty to 3- to 8-inch lengths; it is low plasticity 
 
A4.3.4. Wet shaking test. Form a ball of soil about 0.75 inch in diameter, moistened with water 
to just below the sticky limit. Smooth the soil pat in the palm of the hand with a knife blade or 
small spatula, shake it horizontally, and strike the back of the hand vigorously against the other 
hand. When shaking, water comes to the surface of the sample producing a smooth, shiny, or 
livery appearance. Squeeze the sample between the thumb and forefinger of the other hand. The 
AFPAM 10-219V9   7 DECEMBER 2023 
 
159 
 
 
surface water will disappear. The surface will become dull and the sample will become firm, 
resisting deformation. Cracks will occur as pressure is continued and the sample will crumble. 
If the water content is still adequate, shaking the broken pieces will cause them to liquefy again 
and flow together. This process can only occur when the soil grains are bulky and non-cohesive. 
It is easy to identify very fine sands and silts by this test. Even small amounts of clay will tend 
to retard the reaction to this test. A rapid reaction is typical of non-plastic, fine sands and silts. 
A sluggish reaction indicates slight plasticity, indicating the silt has small amounts of clay or 
organic silts. Note: No reaction at all does not indicate a complete absence of silt or fine sand. 
 
A4.3.5. Cast test. Compress a handful of damp (not sticky) soil into a cylinder and observe its 
ability to be formed and handled. If the: 
 
• Soil crumbles when touched - GP, SP, SW, GW 
• Soil cast withstands careful handling - SM, SC 
• Soil cast can be handled freely - ML, MH 
• Soil cast withstands rough handling - CL, CH 
 
A4.3.6. Wash test. Place a small dry sample of soil into the palm of the hand and cover with 
water. Note how quickly the water discolors and how long the fines are suspended. One 
variation is to look for mud puddles or create them, disturb the soil surface and note how the 
water discolors and how long the fines are suspended. If the water becomes completely 
discolored and hides the sand particles there is evidence of greater than 5 percent silt content. 
  
A4.3.7. Bite or grit test. Grind a small pinch of soil lightly between the teeth. For sandy soils, 
the sharp hard particles of even fine sands will grate very harshly between the teeth and will be 
highly objectionable. For silty soils, silt grains are not particularly gritty, but their presence is 
still quite unpleasant and easily detected. With clayey soils, the clay grains feel smooth and 
powdery like flour, and dry lumps will stick when lightly touched with the tongue. Note: 
Ideally, perform this test on material passing the No. 200 sieve to avoid biting into sand and 
providing separation between silty and clayey fines. 
 
A4.3.8. Shine test. Rub a clay sample with a fingernail or smooth metal surface such as a knife 
blade. Highly plastic clay will produce a definite shine; lean clays will remain dull. 
 
A4.3.9. Feel test. For consistency, squeeze a piece of undisturbed soil between the thumb and 
forefinger; it may be hard, stiff, brittle, friable, sticky, plastic, or soft. Remold the soil by 
working it between the hands. This can indicate the natural water content. Clays that become 
fluid on remolding are probably near their liquid limit; if they remain stiff and crumble, they 
are probably below their liquid limit. Check the texture by rubbing a portion of fine-grained 
soil between the fingers or on a more sensitive area such as the inside of the wrist. Results are 
similar to the bite or grit test. Note: Ideally, perform this test on material passing the No. 200 
sieve to avoid sand particles giving an erroneous reaction. 
 
A4.4. Sedimentation Test. From visual examination, it is relatively easy to approximate the 
proportions of gravels and sands in a soil sample. Determining the proportion of fine-grained 
particles is more difficult but just as important. Although you can separate the fines from the

sample using a No. 200 sieve, the sedimentation test is an alternate field method to separate fines 
from the sand particles in a soil sample. 
 
A4.4.1. Placing a small amount of the fine fraction of a soil (such as a heaping teaspoon) in a 
transparent cup or jar, covering it with about 5 inches of water, and agitating it by stirring or 
shaking will completely suspend the soil in water. With cohesive soils, it will be necessary to 
break up all lumps of soil before adding the water. After soil particles have been dispersed in 
the water and then left, they will start to settle to the bottom, beginning with the larger sized 
particles, in time-periods indicated in Table A4.2. Smaller particles will settle through water at 
a slower rate than large particles. Since all of the particles of soil larger than the No. 200 sieve 
will have settled to the bottom of the cup or jar 30 seconds after the mixture has been agitated, 
it follows that the particles remaining in suspension are fines. Carefully pour the water 
containing the suspended fines into another container 30 seconds after agitation, add more water 
to the cup or jar containing the coarse fraction, and repeat the procedure until the water-soil 
mixture becomes clear 30 seconds after mixing. The cup or jar will contain the coarse fraction 
of the soil and the other container will hold the fines. After absorbing or evaporating the water 
off, the relative amounts of fines and sands can be accurately determined. In clay soils, the clay 
particles will often form small lumps (flocculate) that will not break up in water. If after several 
repetitions of the test substantial amounts of clay are still present in the coarse material, the 
sand will feel slippery. Further mixing and grinding with a stick will be necessary to help break 
up these lumps.

A4.4.2. Table A4.3 is a convenient way to track various field identification tests. As tests are 
completed, mark the results on the chart. The results from the different tests may vary, but by 
plotting the test results, you will have a general indication of the soil type. Essentially, soil types 
and their characteristics can affect how the soil will behave as a construction material. Once 
soil testing and surveys are completed, consider the preparations and actions needed to 
accomplish the specific expedient roadway construction or repair project.
