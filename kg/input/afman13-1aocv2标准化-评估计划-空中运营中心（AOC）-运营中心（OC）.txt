Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Purpose.   This AFMAN identifies the objectives, organization, and responsibilities of the 
AOC/OC STAN/EVAL program, and provides administrative procedures to assure commanders 
at all levels that basic performance requirements for core AOC assignments have been met. The 
intent of this program is divisional and functional qualifications for crewmembers permanently 
assigned to core divisions (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Division (IRD), 
Strategy Division (SRD), Combat Plans Division (CPD) Combat Operations Division (COD), and 
Air Mobility Division (AMD)), involved in planning or executing missions, and/or involved in 
applicable tasking or targeting cycles.   The STAN/EVAL program is designed to provide 
commanders a tool to assess and document individual crewmember knowledge and skills, as well 
as their ability to manage operational risk. 
1.1.1.  This AFMAN sets requirements for both the STAN/EVAL examiner and examinee with 
procedures and evaluation criteria for use during divisional evaluations: (i.e Initial 
Qualification (INIT QUAL), Qualification (QUAL), Mission Qualification (MSN), 
Requalification (RQ), and Spot (SPOT) Evaluations). Specific areas are prescribed to ensure 
an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of operations personnel. 
STAN/EVAL examiners and examinees will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed rating 
criteria in this document. 
1.1.2.  In the rest of this AFMAN, the term “AOC” will refer to all geographic, global, and 
functional AOC and OCs, unless otherwise specified. 
1.1.3.  All certifications awarded prior to the release of the AFMAN rewrite will be 
grandfathered to a qualification that does not require an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew 
Qualification, or AF Form 4350, Certificate of Intelligence Qualification.  Any qualifications 
awarded after the release of this publication will require an AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350.  
Cyber crew positions will be qualified per AFI 17-202 Volume 2, Cybercrew Standardization 
and Evaluation Program, and AFI 17-2ACD Volume 2, Air Force Cyberspace Defense (ACD) 
Standardization and Evaluation.  Other personnel assigned to support the AOC will use AFI 
36-2651, Air Force Training Program, and their career field’s applicable quality assurance, 
certification, or job qualification. 
1.2.  Objectives.   The overall objective of the AOC STAN/EVAL program is to standardize 
procedures and provide commanders with a tool to validate mission readiness and provide 
meaningful indicators reflecting division, team, and overall unit qualifications, capabilities, and 
effectiveness.  Specific program objectives are to: 
1.2.1.  Provide a system to assess and document individual crewmember proficiency and 
capability to accomplish assigned C2 duties. 
1.2.2.  Develop and ensure standardization of applicable operational procedures for weapon 
system employment. 
1.2.3.  Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative directives. 
1.2.4.  Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required. 
 
 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020

Chapter 5 
EVALUATIONS 
5.1.  General.   An evaluation is an assessment of individual crewmember capability to 
accomplish assigned duties within a particular division.  Examinees requiring NAF or MAJCOM 
examiners will consult the appropriate STAN/EVAL Chief for availability. The MAJCOM and/or 
STAN/EVAL Chief may delegate if no appropriate examiner is available. 
5.2.  Qualification Types. 
5.2.1.  A qualification is a documented designation that identifies a crewmember as having the 
capability to accomplish specific duties.  These qualifications are broken into three types:  
“Basic Qualification”; “Mission Qualification”; and “Instructor Qualification”. 
5.2.2.  Basic Qualification.  A documented designation allowing a crewmember to perform the 
duties of a particular division in the AOC during peacetime and/or exercises, but not perform 
the missions of a specific duty position during combat, contingency, or Designed Operational 
Capability (DOC) statement mission operations without supervision and instruction.  
Crewmembers successfully completing Initial Qualification Training (IQT) have a basic 
qualification, and considered basic mission capable (BMC). 
5.2.3.  Mission Qualification.  A documented designation allowing a crewmember to perform 
the missions of a division or duty position in accomplishing the unit’s operational or DOC 
statement mission during combat.  These crewmembers are CMR. 
5.2.4.  Instructor Qualification.  A documented designation allowing a crewmember to instruct 
and provide supervision of unqualified and/or uncertified crewmembers. 
5.3.  Evaluation Types.  There are four types of evaluations, Qualification (QUAL), Mission 
(MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT.  Each qualification may require the completion of requisite 
tasks. (Exception: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks).  As long as the methods accurately 
evaluate all mission tasks, use any combination of:  verbal assessment; verification board briefing; 
observed performance of tasks; part-task simulation; or exercise employment suitable to the crew 
position. 
5.3.1.  Qualification (QUAL) Evaluations. 
5.3.1.1.  Purpose.  To ensure basic qualification (BQ) in the AOC and the specified 
division.  BQ will not allow a crewmember to perform DOC-statement missions 
unsupervised, but does allow unsupervised training and exercise duties within the division. 
(T-3). 
5.3.1.2.  Execution.  Successful completion of IQT per AFI 13-1 AOC Volume 1 results in 
BQ status.  The first evaluation after completion of IQT and mission qualification training 
(MQT) will be a combined initial QUAL evaluation and MSN evaluation.  The initial 
QUAL/MSN evaluation will reflect the AOC’s operational or DOC statement missions, 
structure and procedures.  It may include any combination of verbal assessment, 
verification board briefing, performance tasks, part-task simulations, and/or exercise 
employment suitable to the division. (T-3).  NOTE: See paragraph 5.3.2  for MSN 
evaluation requirements.  AOCV shall document the approved methods for evaluating 
performance.  (T-3). 
18 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
5.3.2.  Mission (MSN) Evaluations. 
5.3.2.1.  Purpose. To assess a crewmember's ability to perform the assigned duties of a 
division in accomplishing the unit’s operational and/or DOC statement mission(s).  
Achieving and maintaining CMR will require successful completion of IQT, MQT, open 
and closed book examinations, a MSN evaluation, and completing continuation training 
(CT) requirements in accordance with AFI 13-1 AOC, Volume 1. (T-3).  A MSN 
evaluation is also used for additional qualifications in other divisions. 
5.3.2.2.  Execution.  The MSN evaluation will reflect the type and difficulty of tasks 
required in a particular crew position’s role in fulfillment of the AOC’s operational or DOC 
statement missions, and may include any combination of verbal assessment, verification 
board briefing, observed performance of tasks, part-task simulations, and/or exercise 
employment suitable to the crew position.  For a crewmember’s first evaluation in a 
division, they must first successfully complete IQT and MQT; the QUAL and MSN 
evaluation will be combined. (T-2).  If a crewmember already is qualified in a division, 
subsequent MSN evaluations in that or other divisions require completing CT 
requirements, passing examinations, and a MSN evaluation.  AOCV shall document the 
approved methods for evaluating performance.  MSN evaluations will be completed in 
accordance with Chapter 10. (T-3). 
5.3.3.  Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. 
5.3.3.1.  Purpose.  To confirm a member's ability to conduct training in a division and/or 
crew position(s) and to obtain and maintain Instructor Qualification. 
5.3.3.2.  Execution. The AOC/CC (or Division Chiefs, if delegated) must certify 
crewmembers designated as instructor. (T-2).  AOC/CCs (or Division Chiefs, if delegated) 
shall specify the method for evaluating in MAJCOM Supplements, which shall include 
direct observation of actual or simulated training in division missions. (T-3).  Trainers will 
complete a locally-developed trainer program per AFI 13-1 AOC Volume 1. (T-3). 
5.3.3.2.1.  INIT INSTR evaluations by instructing an actual student on an instructional 
sortie whenever possible.  When students are not available or mission and/or crew 
composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the 
evaluator should serve as the student. 
5.3.3.2.2.  Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all 
subsequent periodic evaluations. 
5.3.3.2.3.  Instructors. Instructors whose MSN evaluations have expired are not 
qualified to instruct in those areas. (T-3). 
5.3.4.  SPOT Evaluations. 
5.3.4.1.  Purpose.  An optional evaluation of a specific event or requirement without 
intending to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR 
evaluation. 
5.3.4.2.  Execution.  A SPOT evaluation has no specific requisites, unless specified in 
MAJCOM supplements, but may be No-Notice (N/N) in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
19 
5.3.4.2.1.  A SPOT evaluation will be used when the loss of currency requires an 
evaluation to regain currency.  The SPOT evaluation profile will be directed by the 
AOC/CC and will include, as a minimum, those items for which the individual is non-
current and which require an evaluation. 
5.3.4.2.2.  An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a QUAL/MSN 
evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed 
within the periods (document on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 in accordance with 
Chapter 7.). 
5.3.4.2.2.1.  Commanders may authorize additional missions in order to assist a 
crewmember’s accomplishment of periodic requirements (document on the AF 
Form 8 or AF Form 4350 in accordance with Chapter 7.). 
5.3.4.2.2.2.  When the examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified 
in the weapon system (e.g. a senior examiner), the evaluation will not be credited 
towards a periodic evaluation. 
5.3.4.3.  Any other event requiring a qualification or evaluation that is not a QUAL, MSN, 
or INSTR will be documented as a SPOT evaluation. 
5.3.4.4.  Examiner Objectivity SPOT Evaluation.  Evaluations that assess the objectivity, 
decision making and skill of an Examiner in administering a QUAL/MSN evaluation. 
5.3.4.4.1.  Examiners can administer Examiner Objectivity SPOT evaluations to 
evaluators in any division, at the discretion of the examinee’s AOC/CC. 
5.3.4.4.2.  Use SPOT as the type of evaluation under block III Aircrew Evaluation 
Information on the AF Form 8, or block II, Qualification, Task Phase, Event Check, 
portion on the AF Form 4350. Explain that the evaluation was an Examiner Objectivity 
Evaluation in the mission description of the comments section (Block VIII, AF Form 
8 and Block II, AF Form 4350) on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350. The qualification 
level for this type of an evaluation will be either qualified (1 or 2) or unqualified (3). 
5.3.4.4.3.  Use the graded areas and grading criteria in Chapter 10. Use the 
qualification level criteria in accordance with paragraph 5.11 
5.3.4.4.4.  The certification of the Examiner receiving an unqualified Examiner 
Objectivity Evaluation is determined by the AOC/CC, as applicable. 
5.3.4.4.5.  Based on the recommendation of the Examiner giving the Examiner 
Objectivity SPOT evaluation, the AOC/CC (or division chief, if delegated) may issue 
a 
commander 
directed 
downgrade 
AF 
Form 
8 
or 
AF 
Form 
4350  
(MSN/QUAL/INSTR). 
5.4.  Examiner Objectivity Evaluations.  See MAJCOM supplements for Examiner Objectivity 
Requirements. 
5.5.  Prefixes.   The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe MSN, 
QUAL, and INSTR evaluations. 
5.5.1.  Initial (INIT).  The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor qualification, in a 
specific Division (e.g., INIT QUAL/MSN, INIT INSTR). 
20 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
5.5.2.  Requalification (RQ).  An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of qualification due 
to the following reasons: 
5.5.2.1.  Expiration of a required periodic evaluation.  The requalification evaluation will 
be in accordance with the guidance for that periodic evaluation. 
5.5.2.2.  A failed periodic evaluation or a commander-directed downgrade (see paragraph 
5.16).  The Requalification Evaluation will be in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 5.13.1 
5.5.2.3.  When regaining qualification after the completion of a QUAL evaluation in a 
different division, unless approved by MAJCOM to maintain multiple qualification 
statuses. 
5.5.2.4.  When regaining qualification due to loss of currency. 
5.5.2.5.  Use of (RQ) for Instructor Qualification following a failure (N/A following INIT 
INSTR failure) 
5.5.2.6.  The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances: 
5.5.2.6.1.  If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to 
complete one or more of the requisites, and the AOC/CC determines that the 
qualification will be re-established by completion of the requisites without re-
accomplishment of the evaluation. 
5.5.2.6.2.  The evaluation follows a failed INIT evaluation. 
5.5.2.7.  If an instructor passes the MSN and/or QUAL portion of the evaluation, but fails 
the instructor portion of the evaluation, the subsequent evaluation to regain instructor 
qualification will be a RQ INSTR. 
5.5.2.8.  If an instructor fails the MSN and/or QUAL portion of an evaluation but not the 
instructor portion, then a RQ INSTR is not required. 
5.5.3.  No-Notice (N/N).  
5.5.3.1.  The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of daily crew 
performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness. 
5.5.3.2.  A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the evaluation at 
or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal preparation” will be 
as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement. 
5.5.4.  Multiple Prefixes.  More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g., 
N/N SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations and the 
purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the evaluation) will be explained on 
the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 (see paragraph 7.4.3.1.2). 
5.6.  Combined Qualification Evaluations.  To promote efficient use of operational resources, if 
a crewmember will have multiple qualifications, it is recommended that evaluations be completed 
concurrently whenever practical. If combined, evaluators will include the designation of each 
evaluation in the Aircrew Evaluation section of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 (e.g., 
QUAL/MSN). (T-3). 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
21 
5.6.1.  Initial QUAL Evaluations are exempt from concurrent requirement and may be 
completed concurrently with a MSN evaluation.  The crewmember’s gaining unit will 
complete a general AOC INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation once crewmembers complete IQT and 
MQT in accordance with syllabi and AFI 13-1AOCV1, as directed. (T-3). 
5.6.2.  The initial QUAL/MSN evaluation will be completed by the gaining unit in the 
member’s assigned division. If completed concurrently, the gaining unit will document the 
INIT QUAL/MSN evaluation on a single AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350. (T-3). 
5.7.  Cross-Command Evaluations.   To provide flexibility to units experiencing difficulty in 
performing evaluations due to evaluator availability or other unique concerns, evaluations may be 
conducted across MAJCOMs. The requesting unit must justify the need and explain the reasons to 
go outside their parent MAJCOM. (T-1). ACC and ANG units are not required to submit a cross-
command evaluation request between like units as they are considered part of ACC.  Processing 
of cross-command evaluation requests are accomplished as follows: 
5.7.1.  Units identifying a need for a cross-command evaluation must coordinate through their 
chain of command to their MAJCOM OPR. (T-2).  
5.7.2.  Requests must come from commanders of the affected unit through the command chain 
up to the requesting unit’s MAJCOM OPR. (T-3). 
5.7.3.  The requesting unit’s MAJCOM OPR coordinates approval of the evaluation with the 
requested MAJCOM OPR and forwards the approval through channels to the requesting unit. 
5.7.4.  Cross-command evaluation requests may be sent via email or memorandum and include 
the following: 
5.7.4.1.  Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the commander is 
requesting an evaluation. 
5.7.4.2.  Rationale.  Explain why the evaluation cannot be accomplished within the unit’s 
command or what resources the unit lacks (e.g. trainers, evaluators, equipment, or 
evaluation scenarios). 
5.7.4.3.  Recommended unit to conduct the evaluation and any pre-coordination between 
units. 
5.7.4.4.  Impact if request is disapproved. 
5.7.5.  Approved requests will be filed within the individual’s EF and incorporated on the AF 
Form 8 or AF Form 4350 generated by the supporting MAJCOM. (T-3). 
5.8.  Evaluation Criteria. 
5.8.1.  The Lead MAJCOM, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish 
and maintain standardized MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria. (T-2). 
5.8.2.  MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program managers of any command-mandated 
software on any updates of evaluation criteria to aid in the expeditious revision of evaluation 
criteria files. 
5.8.3.  The Lead MAJCOM, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish 
graded areas and subareas. (T-2).  This includes the identification of the following: 
22 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
5.8.3.1.  Required areas.  Graded areas and subareas that must be evaluated for an 
evaluation to be considered complete.  (T-2). 
5.8.3.2.  Critical areas.  Areas where marginal performance is unacceptable.  Critical areas 
are graded either “Q” or “U” and include but are not limited to, Security, Safety, and 
Command Intent. 
5.8.3.3.  Information checks areas. 
5.8.3.3.1.  This is required for QUAL and MSN evaluations and may also be 
accomplished on other evaluations. (T-3). 
5.8.3.3.2.  Each crewmember will demonstrate the ability to access current, accurate 
information applicable to the performance of their duties. The required information 
shall be specified by division, team, and/or crew position in MAJCOM or local unit 
supplements, and is summarized in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 
(AFTTP) 3-3 and AFTTP 3-1 series publications. (T-3). The AFTTP can be located at 
the 
following 
web 
address: 
https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/561jts/afttp/aoc/SitePages/Home.aspx 
5.9.  Grading and Qualification Level.  Individual grades are assigned to each graded area and 
subarea.  Evaluators will assign a qualification level based on the requisite results, the evaluation 
area, and subarea grades.  
5.9.1.  A grade is a characterization of examinee performance in a Graded Area or Graded Sub-
area. 
5.9.2.  Graded areas and subareas are specifically evaluated abilities or skills set within an 
evaluation.  Graded areas and subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) 
grading system.  Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas and subareas. 
5.9.2.1.  Q indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the area and subarea tasks.  The 
examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge and performed within the prescribed 
Q tolerances. 
5.9.2.2.  Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the area and subarea tasks.  The 
examinee demonstrated limited knowledge and/or marginal performance within the 
prescribed Q- tolerances.  Q- must not jeopardize security, safety or be a breach of 
command intent.   Q- requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the 
examiner. 
5.9.2.3.  U indicates the examinee is not qualified to perform the area subarea tasks.  The 
examinee demonstrated insufficient knowledge and/or performance outside allowable Q 
and Q- tolerances.  Any breach of security, safety, or command intent shall result in a U 
grade. (T-3).  U requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the examiner. 
5.10.  Remedial Actions. 
5.10.1.  Debriefed Discrepancy.  Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the 
evaluation wherein the examiner provides instruction concerning the discrepancy and 
determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency. 
 
 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
23 
5.10.2.  Additional Training.  Any training recommended by the examiner to remedy a 
discrepancy identified during an evaluation that cannot be remedied during the evaluation 
debrief.  Unit supplements will outline procedures for ensuring additional training is 
accomplished. 
5.10.2.1.  May include self-study, personal or group instruction, part-task trainer, exercise 
employment, or other method specified in a unit or MAJCOM supplement. 
5.10.2.2.  Additional training must include demonstration of satisfactory knowledge or 
proficiency to an examiner, supervisor or instructor (as stipulated in the Additional 
Training description) to qualify as completed. (T-3).  The examiner will indicate if the 
additional training must be accomplished before the crewmember may perform DOC-
statement missions and duties in the assigned position. (T-3) 
5.10.2.3.  If a crewmember receives a U in specific area that originally required an event 
or task certification from the unit commander (or division chief if delegated), the examiner 
will recommend that the unit decertify the crewmember on that specific event and 
recommend corrective retraining and recertification action. 
5.10.2.4.  If a crewmember exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional training, 
the appropriate level will review the situation and direct appropriate action.  Document the 
circumstances with a Memorandum for Record (MFR) to be included in the AF Form 8 or 
AF Form 4350. (T-3). 
5.10.2.5.  Document additional training on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 in accordance 
with paragraphs 7.4.5 and 7.4.8.5 (T-3). 
5.10.2.6.  If a crewmember fails to complete assigned additional training, the AOC/CC or 
division chief will review the situation.  The AOC/CC or division chief will determine 
whether further additional training should be assigned or the crewmember’s qualification 
(in the case of a Q2) should be revoked with a Commander directed downgrade to Q3, in 
accordance with paragraph 5.16 (T-3). 
5.10.2.6.1.  The examiner must grade the areas subareas listed as “required” in the 
general and specific evaluation sections. (T-3). 
5.10.2.7.  In addition to required areas and subareas, the examiner will grade any non-
required area and subarea that is observed during an evaluation and is listed in the graded 
areas for that type of evaluation. 
5.10.2.8.  Grading criteria tolerances assume uninterrupted task evaluation and stable 
system performance.  If the evaluation is interrupted or system performance is degraded, 
the examiner should allow for resulting errors and delays.  In such cases, a verbal 
evaluation may be an appropriate substitute. 
5.10.2.9.  Minor deviations or errors are acceptable, provided the examinee recognizes and 
corrects their own errors, and such deviations do not jeopardize security, safety, or 
command intent. Consider cumulative errors when determining the area and subarea grade. 
5.10.2.10.  The examiner may further identify any area or subarea as “Commendable” if, 
in the examiner’s determination, the crewmember has demonstrated exceptional skill and 
knowledge.  Document in accordance with paragraph 7.4.8.6.2

AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
5.11.  Qualification Levels.  Qualification levels are assigned to all evaluation types. The 
evaluation qualification level is based on the compilation of the requisite results as well as the 
evaluation graded areas and subareas. Qualification levels performance standards are based on the 
following performance standards: 
5.11.1.  Q1.  The crewmember demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of 
procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the criteria.  This should 
be awarded when no discrepancies were noted.  This may be awarded when discrepancies are 
noted if: 
5.11.1.1.  No U grades were awarded for any graded area or sub-area. 
5.11.1.2.  In the judgment of the examiner, none of the Q- grades precluded awarding of a 
Q1. 
5.11.1.3.  No remedial actions required additional training, only debriefed discrepancies. 
5.11.2.  Q2.  The crewmember demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but there were 
one or more graded area(s) or subarea(s) where additional training was assigned.  The examiner 
will assign this qualification level if: 
5.11.2.1.  A non-critical graded area or subarea grade of U was awarded. 
5.11.2.2.  In the judgment of the examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is justification based 
on Q- performance in one or several graded areas or subareas. 
5.11.3.  Q3.  The crewmember demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety, performance or 
knowledge.  The examiner will assign this qualification level if: 
5.11.3.1.  Any critical area graded U, requires qualification Level of Q3. 
5.11.3.2.  In the judgment of the examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is justification based 
on Q- or U performance in one or several non-critical graded areas or subareas. 
5.11.4.  Assigning the evaluation qualification level. 
5.11.4.1.  The examiner completing the evaluation will assign the evaluation qualification 
level. 
5.11.4.2.  A qualification level of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation 
requirements and requisites have been completed and given due consideration. 
5.11.4.3.  A qualification level of Q3 may be awarded at any time. 
5.11.4.4.  Examiner judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding the 
evaluation qualification level. 
5.11.5.  Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation.  An EQ only applies to the evaluation 
qualification level.  Document on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 in accordance with 
paragraphs 7.4.6 and 7.4.8.2  An EQ may be given when: 
5.11.5.1.  The crewmember received a Q in all graded areas of the evaluation 
5.11.5.2.  The crewmember demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in the requisites 
and the evaluation.

eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the 
current evaluation. (T-3).  The AOC/CC may waive this requirement on a case-by-case 
basis. (Document on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 in accordance with paragraph 
7.4.1.6). 
5.12.2.2.  Out-of-the-Eligibility Period.  For periodic evaluations accomplished outside of 
the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period beginning 
with the month in which the first requisite was completed or the evaluation was 
administered, whichever occurs first. (T-3).  Exception: For extended evaluations (see 
paragraph 5.15.3.2.1), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-
month eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration 
date. 
5.12.2.3.  One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined 
evaluations. 
5.12.2.4.  Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations 
provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite eligibility period for each 
evaluation. 
5.13.  Failure to Pass an Evaluation. 
5.13.1.  Requalification Evaluation. 
5.13.1.1.  The examiner that administered the original evaluation will not normally 
administer the requalification evaluation. (T-3).

5.13.1.4.  Requisites remain valid that were successfully passed within the 6-month period 
for an evaluation that was failed. 
5.13.2.  Mission Ready Status Downgrade.  If a CMR or BMC crewmember receives a Q3 
qualification level on a QUAL and/or MSN evaluation, the commander or division chief will 
downgrade the examinee’s training status to non-combat mission ready or non-basic mission 
capable (NCMR/NBMC) (T-3).  For instructor evaluations, crewmember status (i.e., CMR or 
BMC) need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas or subareas. 
5.13.3.  Restrictions.  When called for by this AFMAN or deemed necessary in the judgment 
of the examiner, mission and/or duty restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until the 
successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a requalification evaluation. (T-
3). 
5.13.3.1.  Restrictions will address the specific phase of operation that requires supervision 
and the criteria for removal of the restrictions. (T-3). 
5.13.3.1.1.  QUAL evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see 
paragraph 5.14) for the crew position in which the evaluation was administered, 
unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional crew 
positions. (T-3).  Multiple-qualified crewmembers may be placed in supervised status 
in all crew positions in which the individual maintains multiple qualification. 
5.13.3.1.2.  MSN evaluation: The examinee may perform BMC (peacetime/exercise) 
tasks unless specifically restricted.  Place the examinee on supervised and/or training 
status for combat mission and/or DOC-statement tasks. (T-3).

supervised status, the type of supervisor (e.g., instructor or designated supervisor) will be 
determined by the AOC/CC or as delegated. (T-3). 
5.14.2.  Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors from 
the relevant division. (T-3). 
5.15.  Timing of Qualification Evaluations. 
5.15.1.  Expiration Date.  Required periodic evaluations expire 24 months after the evaluation 
date, on the last day of that 24th month (e.g. a periodic evaluation in which the evaluation was 
completed on 9 Oct 18 expires on 31 Oct 20). (T-3). 
5.15.2.  Eligibility Period.  Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period, 
defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.

scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria: 
5.15.3.1.  Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period.  Commanders or division 
chiefs may authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility 
period (document in accordance with paragraph 7.4.1.8). 
5.15.3.2.  Extensions of Evaluation Expiration Dates. 
5.15.3.2.1.  MAJCOM STAN/EVAL may authorize blanket or group evaluation 
expiration date extensions on an as-required basis.  Requests for extensions at 
MAJCOM or subordinate levels will be submitted in accordance with paragraph 
5.15.3.2.3.  
5.15.3.2.2.  MAJCOM/A3s may extend an evaluation expiration date up to six months.  
Provide notification to AF/A3TY).  Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in 
MAJCOM supplements to this AFMAN. 
5.15.3.2.3.  Commander or division chiefs may extend an evaluation expiration date up 
to three months only for the reasons listed below (document in accordance with 
paragraph 7.4.1.9).  Extensions are completed be on a case-by-case basis and this 
paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions.  For individual extensions longer 
than three months or for reasons not listed below, see paragraph 5.15.3.2.2  For group 
or blanket extensions, see paragraph 5.15.3.2.1  Requisites not completed during the 
original eligibility period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date. 
5.15.3.2.3.1.  Departing PCS or TDY for training. 
5.15.3.2.3.2.  Crewmembers who are not able to complete the required 
evaluation(s) before or during a deployment, off-station exercise or contingency 
operation status. 
5.15.3.2.4.  Non-Standard Approval Authority. 
5.15.3.2.4.1.  For AOC/CVs and above (e.g. AOC/CCs, NAF/CCs, etc.), the 
approval authority is the next commander in the examinee’s air component chain 
of command. 
5.15.3.2.4.2.  In all other cases, if the operational chain of command differs from 
administrative chain of command (e.g. MAJCOM or NAF attached personnel), 
approvals will be by the attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s 
immediate administrative supervisor. (T-3). 
5.15.3.2.4.3.  For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3TY is the 
approval authority. 
5.15.4.  Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Eligibility Period. 
5.15.4.1.  If a crewmember fails to complete an evaluation within the eligibility period for 
an in-the-eligibility period evaluation, the individual loses the qualification covered by the 
evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.13.3 apply. 
5.15.4.2.  Qualification should be re-established by accomplishing a requalification 
evaluation. 
28 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
5.15.5.  Division Chiefs will ensure that individuals whose periodic evaluations expire either 
within three months after their departure for a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to an AOC 
assignment, or during an upcoming temporary duty (TDY) (AOC or non-AOC), complete the 
required evaluation(s) before departing (T-3).  Coordinate with the gaining AOC Stan/Eval 
(AOC/CCV) for any instances where this requirement cannot be met.  Note: Applies to an 
extended TDY that may preclude the member from completing a required evaluation within 
the prescribed eligibility period. 
5.16.  Commander-Directed Downgrade.   
5.16.1.  A Commander-directed downgrade may be a downgrade (Q- or U) in a specific area 
or sub-area without un-qualifying an individual. 
5.16.2.  A Commander-directed downgrade may direct a downgrade that either removes a 
qualification (e.g., specific crew position) or completely disqualifies an individual. 
5.16.3.  Downgrades may be directed without administering an evaluation using the following 
guidance: 
5.16.3.1.  Examples of mission-related cases include breach of mission related discipline, 
safety, etc.  Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be 
recommended by an examiner from any division or specialty. 
5.16.3.2.  For non-mission-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of, 
administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.).  (Consult with 
the supporting Staff Judge Advocate office for legal advice in these cases.)  Use in cases 
where such incidences directly affect the commander’s confidence in the crewmember’s 
ability to safely operate the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant 
enough to cast doubt on the crewmember’s decision-making abilities). 
5.16.4.  For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely disqualify an 
individual, the affected crewmember will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they 
have been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade. 
5.16.5.  Commander-directed downgrades will be documented in accordance with paragraph 
7.7 (T-2). 
5.17.  Multiple Qualifications.  Multiple qualification guidance applies to crewmembers who 
maintain qualifications in two or more divisions, or as required by the commander or division 
chief. 
5.17.1.  Documentation.  Document commander or division chief authority for multiple 
qualifications, including a list of crew positions in which qualifications will be maintained in 
accordance with paragraph 7.3.1.2 
5.17.2.  QUAL and MSN Evaluations.  All crewmembers require a QUAL evaluation for the 
first qualification in the AOC enterprise and a MSN evaluation for each Division in which a 
crewmember maintains a qualification.  These evaluations will be combined for the initial 
evaluation.  Ground requisites will be completed during each initial and recurring evaluation. 
 
 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
29 
 
5.17.3.  Failure to Pass an Evaluation.  A downgrade resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN 
evaluation applies only to the division for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in 
the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional divisions (e.g., for a 
gross breach of safety, security, or command intent).

EXAMINATION PROGRAM 
6.1.  Purpose.  The AOC examination program measures a crewmember’s knowledge of 
normal/contingency procedures, theater missions, and other information essential for the safe and 
effective planning and execution of air operations through the administration of written or 
computer-based examinations. 
6.2.  Scope.  This chapter applies to all AOC crewmembers who receive an evaluation.  This 
chapter includes requisite examination guidance for periodic evaluations.  Requisite examinations 
include open book examinations and closed book examinations as described in paragraph 5.12 
6.3.  Administrative Procedures. 
6.3.1.  Program Documentation.  Units will document the unit-level crewmember examination 
program. (T-3). 
6.3.2.  Computer-Based Examinations.  MAJCOM directed STAN/EVAL software may fulfill 
the requirement for examinations as outlined in this AFMAN. 
6.3.3.  Retention of Examination Records.  Retain graded examination answer sheets and/or 
computer records until the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 is completed. 
6.4.  Examination Sources. 
6.4.1.  Open Book Examinations.  Open book questions will come from publications 
containing information pertinent to the AOC and performance of the assigned mission. The 
emphasis of open book exams is placed on manuals, instructions or any other document that 
may not require immediate recall or is not regularly referenced. 
6.4.1.1.  The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the examination 
will be made available to crewmembers during testing.  Electronic publications may be 
used as references for open book examinations. 
6.4.1.2.  Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as 
the source for the open book examination.  Do not distribute the SQB to unit crewmembers 
and safeguard it in the same manner as any other required STAN/EVAL examination. (T-
3). 
6.4.2.  Closed Book Examinations.  Major emphasis of closed book examination questions will 
be on AOC systems, AFIs, threat and mission knowledge that crewmembers must immediately 
recall during planning and execution. 
6.4.2.1.  Lead MAJCOMs review MQFs annually; distribute changes to MQFs as 
necessary and ensure/crew-specific MQFs are available to applicable MAJCOMs. 
6.4.2.2.  Local Procedures MQF.  Units may develop and distribute a local procedures 
MQF to augment other MQFs. Units may include any information necessary for mission 
accomplishment not included in the MAJCOM MQF.  Local instructions and unit 
supplements to AFMAN 13-1AOC series are examples of sources for the Local Procedures 
MQF.  At least 10 percent of closed book examination questions will come from the local 
procedures MQF. (T-3). 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020

6.5.  Examination Management.  Units will either maintain prepared examinations for each crew 
position or generate a unique examination for each crewmember. (T-3). 
6.5.1.  Examination Question Review.  AOC STAN/EVAL functions will review all crew 
position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared examinations (if used) annually and as soon as 
possible but not later than three months after any changes in source documents. (T-2).  If a 
complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may be annotated as 
the annual review.  Units will document procedures for the examination reviews in their 
supplement to this AFMAN. (T-2). 
6.5.2.  If prepared examinations are maintained for each division: 
6.5.2.1.  Units with more than 10 crewmembers per division are required to develop and 
control a minimum of two examinations for each division. (T-3). 
6.5.2.2.  Units having ten or fewer crewmembers per division require only one 
examination. 
6.5.2.3.  When different positions are responsible for the same information, units are not 
required to maintain separate examinations for each position. 
6.5.2.4.  Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared examination 
each calendar year. (T-3).   
6.5.3.  If a unique examination is generated for each examination: 
6.5.3.1.  Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for examination creation. 
6.5.3.2.  Examination databases will contain at least twice the number of questions required 
for each examination (e.g., if a 50-question examination is generated, there must be at least 
100 questions in the examination database). (T-2). 
6.6.  Examination Security.  STAN/EVAL personnel will maintain positive control of all 
examinations, applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media. (T-3). 
6.7.  Written or Computer-Based Examinations.  Grade written or computer based 
examinations as a percentage of correct answers.  The minimum passing grade is 85 percent. All 
questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the examination. (T-3). 
6.8.  Failure to Pass a Requisite Examination. 
6.8.1.  Members failing a requisite examination (Open or Closed) will be placed in supervised 
status in accordance with paragraph 5.14 until successful retesting is completed. (T-3). 
6.8.2.  Crewmembers who fail a requisite examination must be afforded an adequate study 
period as defined by the AOC/CC or division chief prior to re-examination. (T-3).   
6.8.3.  Crewmembers who fail a requisite examination must successfully complete the 
examination before the end of their eligibility period or the member loses the qualification 
covered by the evaluation. (T-3). 
6.8.4.  For crewmembers who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting 
from failure of either an open book or closed book examination applies only to the position for 
which the examination was administered.

Chapter 7 
DOCUMENTATION 
7.1.  Scope.  Administration of the evaluation program requires accurate documentation.  This 
chapter provides documentation guidance for all crewmembers that require an evaluation to 
establish qualification. The results of evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350.  
The chronological history of evaluations for a crewmember is recorded on an AF Form 942, 
Record of Evaluation or an AF Form 4349, Record of Intelligence Evaluation.  Units will use 
electronic database files for record keeping, trend analysis, etc. These AF forms are maintained in 
the EF. (T-3). 
7.1.1.  AF Form 8 will be used for all career aviators. (T-3). 
7.1.2.  AF Form 4350 will be used for non-aviator careers in teams and/or positions specified 
by the AOC/CC, to include intelligence personnel, unless specified by their applicable 
standardization and evaluation program (e.g., cybercrew per AFI 17-202v2). (T-3). 
7.1.3.  In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is encouraged, to include use 
of electronic signatures and wholly electronic EFs.  In all instances, computer-generated forms 
must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-Publishing web site. (T-3) 
7.2.  Qualifications versus Certifications.  Qualifications are attained through evaluations and 
documented on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350, as applicable.  Certifications are attained through 
methods other than evaluation and documented AOC guidance. 
7.3.  Qualification Forms. 
7.3.1.  The AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 is the source document used to record the evaluation 
and verify the qualification of a crewmember. (T-3). 
7.3.1.1.  Use the associated form to record crewmembers maintaining qualification in a 
single division. 
7.3.1.2.  Use the associated form to record crewmembers maintaining multiple 
qualifications in accordance with paragraph 5.17 
7.3.1.3.  An AF Form 8 or AF Form 4350 is accomplished by the Examiner, Reviewing 
Officer, Final Approving Officer, the examinee and a Certifying Official (if additional 
training was required). 
7.3.2.  General Data Entry.  See AF Form 942 and AF 4349. 
7.3.2.1.  In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by 
the electronic form should be used (see also paragraph 7.1.3).  However, an “X” can be 
replaced with a “√” or other standard form, as long as such preference is standardized 
throughout the document. 
7.3.2.2.  For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format 
(e.g. 24 Jun 18). 
7.3.2.3.  The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a 
three-letter month and two-digit year format (e.g. Jun 18). 
AFMAN13-1AOCV2  18 FEBRUARY 2020 
33 
7.3.2.4.  Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation, 
“QUAL”), use upper and lower case letters. 
7.3.2.5.  Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of data 
are not specified.  MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as desired.

Debriefed Discrepancy—Remedial action taken by an examiner to remedy a discrepancy noted 
during an evaluation.  This action is accomplished during debrief of the evaluation wherein the 
examiner provides briefing and/or instruction concerning the discrepancy and determines that the 
examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy said discrepancy.  The 
discrepancy area description is annotated with “Debriefed” in the Examiner’s Remarks section of 
the AF Form 8 Comments. 
Division—One of the five core AOC divisions, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance 
Division (IRD), Strategy Division (SRD), Combat Plans Division (CPD) Combat Operations 
Division (COD), and Air Mobility Division (AMD). 
Eligibility Period—This is the 6-month period prior to expiration date of an evaluation during 
which all written and positional requirements for the recurring QUAL/MSN must be completed. 
Evaluation—1) The procedure to determine the effectiveness of the performance of an 
instructional product or process in order to ascertain specific causes for the effectiveness or lack 
of it, and to make decisions appropriate to the extent of the effectiveness.  Evaluation of formal 
courses includes field evaluation and internal evaluation.  2) The review and analysis of qualitative 
or quantitative data obtained from design review, hardware inspection, testing or operational use 
of equipment.  3) The positional and written examinations used to determine proficiency as 
prescribed by AFMAN and any applicable supplements.  See also Joint Pub 1-02, Department of 
Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms. 
Evaluation Folder (EF)—A two-part folder containing the source documents that constitute the 
history of C2 qualifications of each crew member. 
INSTR Evaluation—A means of assessing a crewmember’s ability to instruct other crewmembers 
in operations, academics and positional duties. This evaluation initially establishes or reestablishes

operations knowledge and procedures. 
Master Question File (MQF)—A general knowledge question bank. 
Mission Qualification Evaluation (MSN)—Qualifies a crewmember to perform assigned crew 
position duties in accomplishing the unit’s operational or DOC statement mission.  This evaluation 
is given after MQT and during Recurring Evaluation (QUAL/MSN) to determine an individual’s 
CMR status.  Requires AF Form 8 documentation. 
No—Notice Evaluation (N/N)—An evaluation where the examinee is notified of the evaluation 
at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission.  These evaluations may be complete 
qualification evaluations, a written examination only, or a positional evaluation covering only 
selected areas. 
Non—Combat Mission Ready/Non-Basic Mission Capable (NCMR/NBMC)—This is the 
status of an individual who does not meet training cycle CT requirements, fails to meet lookback
