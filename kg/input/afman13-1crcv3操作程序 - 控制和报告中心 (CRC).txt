GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  General.  This publication guides the operational readiness and employment of the CRC.  
Instructions for reference includes, but not limited to: Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 13-1 GBMC2 
Volume 
2, 
Ground 
Battle 
Management 
Command 
and 
Control 
(GBMC2) 
Standardization/Evaluation Program and AFMAN 13-1CRC Volume 2, Control and Reporting 
Center (CRC) - Evaluation Criteria. 
1.1.1.  As a key command and control (C2) element of the Theater Air Control System 
(TACS), the CRC is subordinate to the Air Operations Center (AOC) in accordance with Air 
Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1-S/NF, Air Operations Center (AOC) 
and AFTTP 3-3 AOC.  The CRC is responsible for conducting wide area surveillance, fusing, 
and forwarding the composite surveillance information, and providing battle management of 
air operations.  The CRC directly supports the Joint Forces Commander (JFC) and the 
Combined Forces Component Commander (CFACC) and/or Joint Forces Air Component 
Commander (JFACC).  The CRC is normally under the operational control of the JFACC and 
provides, as delegated, decentralized execution of air operations in an assigned battle 
management area. 
1.1.2.  The CRC will normally execute and operate in accordance with the CFACC’s or 
JFACC’s joint air operations plan, air operations directive, master air attack plan, rules of 
engagement (ROE), area air defense plan, air tasking order (ATO), operational tasking data 
link, tactical operational data, airspace control order and special instructions.  The CRC is 
vertically integrated with the AOC and horizontally with the other TACS elements (e.g., E-
3C/G Airborne Warning and Control System or Air Support Operations Center).  It also 
integrates with joint C2 resources (e.g., the TAGS).  AFTTP 3-2.17, Multi-Service Tactics, 
Techniques, and Procedures for the Theater Air-Ground System (TAGS) provides integration 
procedures for each service C2 and airspace management systems.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
2.1.  General.  This manual establishes the roles and responsibilities, procedures, and guidance 
applicable to the conduct of operations of the CRC weapon system.  Additionally, the manual 
provides operational guidance to the Air Control Squadron (ACS) Commander (CC), Director of 
Operations (DO), operations supervisors, mission crewmembers, maintenance and/or support 
personnel (where applicable).  The CRC is comprised of the AN/TYQ-23A tactical air operation 
module, and associated mission computers, surveillance, and communication systems.  This 
volume, in conjunction with other governing directives, prescribes those procedures applicable to 
the operation of the CRC under most anticipated circumstances.  It is, however, not a substitute 
for sound judgment on the part of the CC and/or DO and CRC personnel.  Operational procedures 
not specifically addressed in this, or other accompanying guidance may be implemented if it 
enhances safe and effective mission accomplishment.  The Air Control Squadron Commander 
(SQ/CC) will report deviations performed without waiver, through channels to ACC/A3CG within 
48 hours, followed by a written report.  (T-3) 
2.1.1.  This AFMAN provides that in the absence of additional guidance, CRC mission 
crewmembers operating equipment other than system of record (i.e., non-system of record) 
will use this volume as a baseline for conduct of operations at the discretion of the SQ/CC with 
higher echelon authority.  (T-3) 
2.1.2.  This publication does not provide tactics, techniques, and procedures for employing the 
CRC in a combat or contingency environment.  However, guidance for tactical employment of 
the CRC can be found in the following: AFTTP 3-1-S/NF CRC, Tactical Employment – CRC; 
AFTTP 3-3.CRC, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals – CRC ; AFTTP 3-3.TACS, Theater Air 
Control System (TACS); AFTTP 3-2.17; AFTTP 3-1.IPE-S/NF, Integrated Planning and 
Execution; AFTTP 3-3.IPE; and the CRC Concept of Employment; AFMAN 11-214, Air 
Operations Rules and Procedures, provides tactics, techniques, and procedures considerations 
for both training and contingency operations. 
2.1.3.  Offices of collateral responsibility for this publication are USAFE-AFAFRICIA

command operations programs and establishes responsibility for implementation of the 
program as outlined in this manual. 
2.7.2.  ACC/A3C provides guidance to conduct CRC operations and implements the program 
as outlined in this manual, safely and efficiently, in coordination with National Guard Bureau 
Director of Operations (NGB A3/10) and USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ. 
2.7.3.  Each MAJCOM may use CMR and/or basic mission capable augmentees from other 
MAJCOMs to support or conduct cross-command program reviews of operations procedures, 
with coordination and concurrence of the MAJCOM organizations involved (e.g., ACC/A3CG, 
USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ, and NGB A3/10).  Augmentees will use the criteria of the 
MAJCOM they are augmenting.  Augmentees will be CMR and/or basic mission capable in 
the mission design series of the unit in which they are supporting; further guidance found in 
AFMAN 13-1CRC Volume 1, Control and Reporting Center (CRC) – Training.  (T-3) 
2.7.4.  Squadron leadership is defined as the CC, DO, and senior operations enlisted (i.e., E-8 
and E-9) personnel.  Squadrons are encouraged to exercise flexibility when creating and 
executing tailored operations training plans which will allow squadron leadership to capitalize 
on personnel with previous Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) platform 
experience.  This will also have the added benefit of allowing allocation of training resources 
to less experienced operators.  While flexibility is encouraged, all training guidance can be 
found in AFMAN13-1CRCV1.  It is not the intent for squadron leadership to be assigned to a 
formed mission crew and this should be done strictly by exception only.

Chapter 3 
DEPLOYMENT AND MISSION PLANNING 
3.1.  Deployment Planning.  The deployment of the CRC in whole or part may be required to 
directly support an Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force or an Air and Space Expeditionary 
Force contingency operations regardless of location, complexity, and duration with little or no 
warning. 
3.1.1.  Future operational contingency environments may dictate employing the CRC in 
dynamic, non-traditional configurations.  Consideration of employment risk options must be 
considered when operating from either a main operating base, forward operating base, or 
deployed radar site, in contested and/or highly contested environments that may cover vast 
geographical areas of operations.  (T-3) 
3.1.2.  Dynamic employment continuum requires the SQ/CC to exercise flexibility to mitigate 
risks with consideration for mission requirements in concert with recommending optimum 
placement.  However, CCs must retain the capability to react and adjust CRC placement as the 
threat environment moves along the uncontested to the highly contested tactical threat 
spectrum.  (T-3)  CRC personnel should consult AFTTP 3-1.IPE, for additional considerations. 
3.1.3.  In anticipation of or the actual receipt of the deployment warning order, the SQ/CC will 
activate the unit deployment control center to facilitate deployment planning in accordance 
with AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.  (T-3)  The SQ/CC will determine the 
unit deployment control center manning, but effective deployment planning must be inclusive 
of the entire CRC complex to include operations, support, and maintenance.  (T-3)  AFTTP 3-
1.CRC and AFTTP 3-3.CRC series volumes should be referred to for an extensive set of 
deployment checklists and planning considerations.  In addition, the SQ/CC must take 
proactive pre-warning order steps in consideration of the actual deployment to include site 
surveys as time and resources permit.  (T-3) 
3.1.4.  The SQ/CC will organize and plan, deploy, and execute tasked missions through 
employment of UTCs: CRC Lead Element (7FVBL), Follow-BMC2 (7FVWL), and Deployed 
Radar (DR) (7FVDC) UTCs.  (T-3)  In addition, the ANG employs the Mission Equipment 
Technical Specialist (7FVBW) UTC.  Required associated communications, support vehicles, 
and equipment are resident with the 7FVBL, 7FVWL, and 7FVDC UTCs.  However, 7FVBL, 
and 7FVWL UTCs are not considered mobile and will require host operating base logistical 
support.  The 7FVDC UTC maintains a fully mobile capability. 
3.2.  Mission Planning.  The SQ/CC will actively direct the execution of the unit’s operation’s 
schedule and mission planning effort; however, the CC may delegate authority to the DO.  (T-3)  
The CC and/or DO will ensure that all operations personnel are provided with the requisite support 
to plan and execute the mission.  (T-3)  They will ensure the mission crewmembers and mission 
planners have no barriers to mission planning and ensure that every mission is thoroughly planned, 
briefed, executed, and debriefed.  (T-3) 
3.2.1.  The responsibility for the conduct of mission planning is shared between mission crew 
leads and the designated mission planning cell (MPC) chief.  In coordination, they will ensure 
the CRC is properly prepared for the assigned tasking.  (T-3) 
10 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
3.2.2.  The CC and/or DO will ensure that the intent of mission planning, whether for an in-
garrison daily training event or contingency operations, is to prioritize and focus the efforts of 
the CRC and in particular the mission crewmembers to meet established training objectives.  
(T-3)  Additionally, an objective in the case of contingency operations is the responsibility for 
radar surveillance and the direction and/or control of air operations supporting the CFACC or 
JFACC.  The CC will delineate areas of responsibility, fully develop courses of action (COAs), 
identify required resources, and identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks and/or threats.  (T-3) 
3.3.  Mission Planning Cell (MPC).  The MPC ensures that mission crewmembers have access 
to the most current operational and intelligence information for effective mission execution 
derived from all available sources.  (T-3)  The SQ/CC may activate the MPC while still in-garrison 
in anticipation or receipt of a real-world alert, warning, or execute order.  The CRC MPC is the 
single point of contact for the planning, tactical level coordination, and briefing and/or debriefing 
of tasked completed missions.  The MPC chief will ensure that the necessary mission and support 
equipment has been identified, available, and configured to execute the tasked mission.  (T-3)  The 
MPC Chief (Section Lead (SL)), and staff (e.g., Air Battle Manager (ABM), Air Surveillance 
Technician (AST), Senior System Operator (SSO), Interface Control Technician (ICT), Mission 
System Operator (MSO), and/or Intelligence (INTEL) personnel) will ensure the mission crew is 
provided the most current information for effective mission execution.  (T-3)  In addition to MPC 
members maintaining CMR or basic mission capable status, selected individual crewmembers (i.e., 
ABM, AST, ICT, and MSO), should complete additional training (e.g., tactical data link (TDL)) 
courses in accordance with Table 3.1 below.  The MPC should also be activated for mission 
training exercises to develop, exercise, and validate unit planning tactics, techniques, and 
procedures.  The unit will maintain a MPC in accordance with Table 3.1. (T-3)  However, the 
SQ/CC may choose the appropriate manning to meet mission tasking.  The Group/CC (or 
equivalent) may issue a waiver for the qualification and certifications requirements detailed in 
Table 3.1.

OPERATIONS 
4.1.  Operations.  The CRC has the capability to conduct BMC2 of forces, including assuming 
the role and responsibilities of Regional Air Defense Commander (RADC) or Sector Air Defense 
Commander (SADC), and the functions of airspace management found in Joint Publication (JP) 
3-52, Joint Airspace Control, air surveillance, combat identification, and TDL operations.  The 
mission success is dependent upon operationally configured equipment, systems and assigned 
personnel in CMR and/or basic mission capable status to prosecute the mission.  Unit personnel 
and mission crewmembers will be thoroughly prepared to practice communications and operations 
security in accordance with AFMAN 17-1302-O, Communication Security (COMSEC) 
Operations, and AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC), and be knowledgeable of current 
friendly and adversary operation’s information to effectively operate in contested and highly 
contested environments with fully operational or degraded systems.  (T-3)  To operate within the 
combatant command’s directives, the CRC may be required to mobilize and deploy assigned 
personnel and/or equipment.  If unit deployment is required the CRC will, within 24 uninterrupted 
hours upon arrival at the designated employment site (e.g., main operating base, forward operating 
base, or deployed radar site), declare the ability to meet the combatant command’s tasked 
requirements.  (T-3) 
4.2.  Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Function and Mission.  The CRC function is to 
facilitate decentralized execution of joint or combined air operations on behalf of the CFACC or 
JFACC.  The CRC executes its assigned mission as assigned by the CFACC or JFACC, in 
accordance with the joint air operations plan.  Additionally, the CRC will support the CFACC or 
JFACC air operations current planning and execution effort by maintaining a common tactical 
picture which contributes to an integrated AOC common operational picture.  (T-3)  The physical 
placement, location, and configuration of a CRC to conduct these operations are tailorable and 
flexible to best meet mission objectives in their assigned area of responsibility or battle 
management area. 
4.2.1.  Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2).  BMC2 of air forces is the 
management of activities within the operational environment based on the commands, 
direction, and guidance given by appropriate combatant command’s authority.  C2, including 
battle management, is the binding element that integrates capabilities and operations within 
and among joint forces.  Battle management entails visualizing and employing where, when, 
and with which forces to apply capabilities to achieve assigned mission objectives. 
4.2.2.  BMC2 of air forces for the CRC is the art of translating real-time battlespace awareness, 
operational guidance (e.g., execute delegated authorities), and combat potential into decisive 
action at the tactical level.  CRC BMC2 is enabled by CMR operators using battlespace 
situational display computer operator workstations (OWSs), and robust communications 
equipment to receive, display and interpret battlespace information to include space and 
cyberspace information and taking tactical action based on the near real-time situation.  The 
equipment suite provides an intuitive human machine interface (e.g., visual displays, 
communications connectivity, and the network centric interoperability systems and 
components) that enable CRC operators to make decisive and timely tactical decisions in the 
battlespace.  Effective BMC2 requires situational awareness, managing available resources, 
14 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
directing, and controlling the correct tactical action in a timely manner, and monitoring and 
assessing mission execution.  To execute the CRC mission, the CRC conducts and/or provides 
the following mission essential functions: 
4.2.2.1.  Weapons Control.  The CRC supports and/or coordinates defensive counter air 
and/or offensive counter air, air interdiction, air refueling, close air support, combat search 
and rescue and/or personnel recovery, high value airborne asset protection, destruction 
and/or suppression of enemy air defenses, electronic warfare, intelligence, surveillance, 
reconnaissance, special operations, and the direction of air defense artillery weapon 
systems for theater air defense.  Guidance to conduct these missions can be found in: JP 3-
09; Joint Fire Support; Air Force Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 3-0, Operations and 
Planning; AFDP 3-01, Counterair Operations; AFDP 3-03, Counterland Operations; 
AFDP 3-05, Special Operations; AFDP 3-27, Homeland Operations; AFDP 3-30, 
Command and Control; AFDP 3-50, Personnel Recovery; AFTTP 3-2.90, Personnel 
Recovery; AFDP 3-52, Airspace Control. 
4.2.2.2.  Air and Missile Defense BMC2.  The CRC is organized, trained, and equipped to 
execute integrated air and missile defense.  The CRC can assume the role as RADC or 
SADC on behalf of the Area Air Defense Commander, normally the JFACC.  The mission 
for the CRC is to ensure its capabilities are integrated with overlapping TACS and joint 
elements to defend the homeland and deployed United States (US) or coalition assets.  It 
is tied to the counter air mission that emphasizes integrating both offensive counter air with 
defensive counter air operations at the theater level to gain and maintain air superiority.  
Integration of the CRC into the existing TACS architecture includes the operational 
relationships, interfaces, and control capabilities and responsibilities with other 
overlapping BMC2 and lethal resources to defend US or coalition assets to gain and then 
maintain air superiority.  Effective coordination between the CRC SL and the US Army 
Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO) and/or US Army Air Defense 
Artillery Fire Control Assistant (ADAFCA) directing US Army air defense artillery assets 
is paramount to effect successful engagement of any air and missile threat regardless of 
type.  When deployed, ADAFCO and/or ADAFCA personnel will be resident in the CRC 
and will augment the mission crew as required.  (T-3) 
4.2.2.3.  Airspace Management.  Airspace management is the implementation of the 
airspace control order on behalf of the AOC airspace control authority, normally the 
JFACC, in accordance with JP 3-52.  The CRC provides positive and procedural airspace 
management with guidance from Air Land Sea Space Application (ALSSA) AFTTP 3-
2.78, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airspace Control (Airspace 
Control).  These tasks include aerial refueling, pre- and/or post-strike force marshaling and 
recovery, airspace activation, enroute tactical flight following (e.g., tracking and 
deconfliction), procedural control in support of non-combatants, air interdiction, close air 
support, kill box interdiction, or strike coordination and reconnaissance.  The CRC may 
also support continental US Air Defense and/or Homeland Security in accordance with 
AFDP 3-27.  The CRC implements airspace control order elements to include tanker 
anchors, transit boulevards, air routes, and other airspace control measures to route aircraft 
safely and efficiently through the battle management area enroute to their designated 
working areas.  Airspace control measures will be created dynamically with the use of 
restricted operating zones, high density air control zones, missile engagement zones, and 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
15 
joint engagement zones, etc., and requires flexibility and attention to detail to manage 
effectively and safely.  (T-3) 
4.2.2.4.  Air Surveillance.  The SL and AST/SSO/MSO will ensure a recognizable air 
picture is established internal to the CRC and provided to CRC operators and supported 
friendly forces.  (T-3)  Operators will detect, identify, classify, and track airborne objects 
within sensor coverage for its assigned area of responsibility.  (T-3)  Operators will 
correlate, prioritize, and apply all-source and/or sensor data into its common tactical 
picture, and forward the picture providing battlespace awareness to the AOC’s common 
operational picture which displays a fused and correlated air, ground, and maritime sensor 
data picture.  (T-3) 
4.2.2.5.  Combat Identification.  The CRC has a limited capability to determine combat 
identification through positive and procedural means.  It has the capability, once 
established, to disseminate timely, accurate, and relevant positive identification 
information to allow successful engagement of hostile targets in accordance with theater 
ROE.  In addition to organic system capabilities that support lack-of-friendly and presence-
of-friendly characterization (e.g., identification, friend, or foe/selective identification 
feature (IFF/SIF), the CRC leverages combat identification capable off-board assets and 
processes, to provide the CRC a fused-sensor positive identification capability. 
4.2.2.6.  Tactical Data Link (TDL) Management.  The SL and AST/SSO/MSO will ensure 
an optimum common tactical picture is planned, established, managed, and provided, to 
operations internally and provided to supported external friendly forces through effective 
TDL management.  (T-3)  TDL management is facilitated by the effective planning, 
analysis, and monitor of the multi-tactical data link network(s).  It includes the reception 
of sensor data (i.e., from organic AN/TPS-75 radar system(s) and additional external 
sensors), processing, and forwarding of the CRC recognizable air picture to the AOC and 
other BMC2 nodes to include lateral joint agencies.  The CRC consolidates organic (i.e., 
AN/TPS-75), and non-organic sensor data into the CRCs common tactical picture for 
distribution over established TDLs.  It is also responsible for the digital display and transfer 
of battle management data via data link message sets and commands.  Additionally, under 
the direction of the AOC’s Joint Interface Control Officer, the CRC may be tasked to 
manage a region or sector of the multi-tactical data link network(s) architecture within its 
area of responsibility and therefore assume the role of Region or Sector Interface Control 
Officer.  The CRC supports Joint Range Extension Application Protocol A, and/or B, 
and/or C, Satellite-J, Serial J, Link 11, Link 11B, Link 16, and Situation Awareness Data 
Link.  The CRC can act as a data forwarder by transmitting its tactical data vertically and/or 
horizontally to the AOC and other lateral, joint, or combined theater C2 nodes.  The Joint 
Interface Control Officer is responsible for the planning, establishing, and maintaining the 
theater multi-tactical data link network(s) and providing a common tactical picture input 
to the joint data network for integration into the AOC’s common operational picture. 
4.3.  Declaring Operational Status.  A fully mission capable system is the ultimate objective of 
the maintenance effort.  This manual, crew aid checklists, unit, theater contingency LOPs and 
special instructions, as applicable, outlines the conditions to declare operational status for both 
contingency and in-garrison operations.  In the absence of directive theater guidance, the minimum 
operational requirements outlined in the CRC crew aids in conjunction with the below listed items 
are used to declare operational status.  In general terms, the Commander and/or DO will utilize the 
16 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
following in declaring operational status in a deployed environment: (1) securing and completing 
site bed-down (if required), (2) critical mission equipment operational, (3) priority 
communications and datalinks are established per training, exercise plan, theater operations plan, 
or Annex K, Theater Communications Plan, and (4) CMR and/or basic mission capable mission 
crew briefed and in position and able to conduct mission operations will constitute declaration of 
status.  (T-3) 
4.3.1.  The SL for contingency operations or the senior ranking operator for in-garrison training 
missions will declare and then report the operational status of the weapons system based on 
the operational tasking through appropriate reporting channels.  (T-3)  The SL or senior 
ranking officer will report the estimated time required to return to fully mission capable.  (T-3)  
Mission capable status is characterized and reported as meeting one of the following: 
4.3.1.1.  Fully Mission Capable.  All mission support systems, subsystems, and 
components are functioning as designed.  Fully mission capable provides the capability to 
fully accomplish 100% of the mission objectives tasked by the CFACC or JFACC or the 
established in-garrison training objectives without mission degradation or impact. 
4.3.1.2.  Partially Mission Capable.  One or more mission support systems, subsystems, or 
components are not functioning.  Partially mission capable status denotes an ability to 
accomplish some, but not all, of the established mission objectives tasked by the CFACC 
or JFACC or the established in-garrison training objectives while experiencing partial 
mission degradation. 
4.3.1.3.  Non-Mission Capable.  The total inability to accomplish the assigned mission 
objectives tasked by the CFACC or JFACC or any portion of the established in-garrison 
training objectives due to failure of mission support systems, subsystems, or components. 
4.3.1.4.  Risk Mitigation.  After thorough risk mitigation in accordance with AFI 90-802, 
Risk Management, and AFPD 10-24, Mission Assurance, the SL, or the senior ranking 
operator (i.e., for in-garrison training missions), will determine a course of action for the 
feasibility of continuing mission operations under degraded conditions (e.g., degraded 
sensors, support equipment, required CMR and/or basic mission capable personnel).  (T-3) 
4.3.2.  Guidance as provided by unit or theater LOPs and special instructions take precedence 
over these published minimums when applicable.  The SL will, after ensuring the minimum 
mission capable and risk mitigation requirements are met, call the CFP and in turn higher 
echelon authority (e.g., AOC, if required) to declare operational status.  (T-3) The following, 
but not limited to the following will be considered prior to declaring operational status: 
4.3.2.1.  Previously planned UTCs are on-site and operational to accomplish the tasked 
mission.  (T-3) 
4.3.2.2.  The CRC SL regardless of having received a threat assessment by appropriate 
higher echelon authority (e.g., AOC), will establish acceptable risk to the CRC.  (T-3) 
4.3.2.3.  SL and AST/SSO/MSO will complete the step positional briefings (or the MPC 
step briefing) to their respective battle management team (BMT) and/or sensor operations 
team (SOT) prior to reporting to their respective duty positions in the tactical operations 
center (TOC).  (T-3)  The SL and AST/SSO/MSO will update the mission crewmembers 
with changes as appropriate.  (T-3) 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
17 
4.3.2.4.  Once equipment is released to the mission crew, crewmembers will initiate 
checkout of equipment utilizing unit mission crew aids, LOPs, and standard operating 
procedures as appropriate.  (T-3) 
4.3.2.5.  Periodic radar evaluation program (PREP) assessment will be completed on the 
units’ radar(s), to include the DRs, by the Electronic Protection Technician (EPT) (or 
certified PREP crewmember), and status and/or results reported to the SL/AST/SSO/MSO.  
(T-3) 
4.3.2.6.  Sensor correlation checks will be completed by the SL and/or AST/SSO/MSO to 
determine optimum or minimally acceptable radar and IFF/SIF settings as referenced in 
LOPs, letters of agreement and/or memorandums of understanding, mission crew aid 
checklists, worksheets, or as specified in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) JO 
7610.14, Non-Sensitive Procedures and Requirements for Special Operations, if tasked as 
a military radar unit or tactical monitor.  (T-3) 
4.3.2.7.  Database management which includes the battle management computer, support 
databases, and communication systems will be monitored to provide an accurate digital 
display and transfer of battle management data and commands.  (T-3) 
4.3.2.8.  All mission support equipment (e.g., datalinks, radios, computer, encryption 
devices) must be available to conduct assigned tasking.  (T-3) 
4.3.2.9.  The CRC has established communications with organizations exercising tactical 
control.  In addition, communications are established with all external agencies and units 
in which the CRC must have immediate communications and datalink connectivity to 
effect mission operations.  (T-3) 
4.4.  Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).  The flight crew information file is multi-volume and 
available to mission crewmembers, consisting of current information essential to the conduct or 
mitigation of operations or emergency situations.  The read file portion of the flight crew 
information file centralizes significant, time sensitive issues and procedures that are to be 
disseminated to operations personnel.  The content and management of the flight crew information 
file is prescribed in AFMAN 13-1GBMC2 V2. The SL is responsible for ensuring all 
crewmembers review required read-files prior to assuming operational duties.  (T-3) 
4.5.  Local Operating Procedures (LOPs).  Each unit will create LOPs which will further define 
procedures for operating in-garrison training environment.  (T-3)  It may be necessary to also 
create LOPs for deployed locations if deemed necessary, for information not contained in theater 
guidance (e.g., special instructions). 
4.5.1.  DAFMAN 90-161, prescribes the paragraph method as the only authorized approach to 
supplement an AFMAN, therefore supplemented material must be arranged in accordance with 
the basic publication it is to supplement.  Units may publish guidance in a single, stand-alone 
local operating instruction and/or manual instead of supplementing this AFMAN. 
4.5.2.  The DO will sign the unit’s LOP and ensures it is filed in Volume 3 of the flight crew 
information file.  (T-3) 
4.5.3.  The DO will ensure the LOP is reviewed for currency as required, or at least every 18 
months and certifies with a memorandum for record.  (T-3) 
18 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
4.5.4.  Interim changes (ICs) made to the LOP do not cause the LOP to expire.  ICs are formally 
integrated into the LOP at the next 18-month review period.  MFRs are not used to extend an 
LOP with ICs attached. 
4.6.  Mission Voice Recording.  All missions involving the control of live aircraft will be 
recorded to the maximum extent possible.  (T-3)  Voice recording of missions is essential to 
provide necessary forensic information concerning declared aircraft emergencies, aircraft 
accidents, and/or any event resulting in a subsequent civilian or military investigation.  Recording 
also provides an asset in debriefing and determining lessons learned and for the development of 
tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Units will utilize a standard designating and labeling format 
for logging mission recordings.  (T-3)  Format is YYYYMMDD-Mission Profile-Last Name of 
mission crewmember (e.g., 20180615-DCA-Brady).  (T-3) 
4.6.1.  Chat provides text-based, secure, real-time, persistent communications within the CRC 
external agencies.  Chat recording logs will be maintained, marked, handled, stored, and 
disposed with guidance from Department of Defense Manual (DoDM) 5200.01 Volume 
2_AFMAN 16-1404 Volume 2, Information Security Program: Marking of Classified 
Information, and AFI 33-322.  (T-3) 
4.6.2.  Both video and voice recording media of training and/or operational mission events is 
required to be retained for instructional debrief or reconstruction of real-world events.  The SL 
or higher authority may direct specific media products (to include Chat logs), to be retained 
and secured for a specific reason (e.g., aircraft accident or operational incident) of possible 
interest to both the mission crew or external agencies (e.g., FAA or USAF Accident 
Investigation Board).  The SL will ensure the recorded media will be identified, marked, and 
retained in a secure container and/or electronic medium for a period of six months or until 
request is adequately satisfied.  (T-3)  When storing media, mark appropriately with the 
requester’s name, rank, duty title, organization, and disposition instructions if known.  In 
addition, annotate the media's classification (e.g., at least Secret), YYYYMMDD-Mission 
Profile-Last Name of mission crewmember (e.g., 20180615-DCA-Brady).  The SL will ensure 
this information will also be logged in the Operations Logbook.  (T-3) 
4.6.3.  The DO will ensure that personnel are trained, and that procedures are in place when 
required to provide immediate forensic reconstruction of media related to flight safety or 
critical mission events.  (T-3) 
4.7.  Forms and Logs.  This manual prescribes and directs the use of AF Form 4145, Daily 
Activity Log and AF Form 4146, Mission Briefing Guide.  Units with access to the Learning 
Management System, the Patriot Excalibur system, or another MAJCOM-approved programs will 
use the applicable program as the primary system of documentation.  (T-3)  The DO will ensure 
AF Forms 4145, or locally generated equivalent forms are readily available to meet training and 
operational requirements in support of CRC daily operations prior to the start of mission 
operations.  (T-3) 
4.7.1.  The SL, DO designee, or senior ranking operator will be responsible for the Daily 
Activity Log.  (T-3)  The form is required to be completed and signed at the completion of 
each mission crew shift and forwarded to the DO for approval and signature.  The Daily 
Activity Log provides a complete summary of all mission crew operations for a particular shift 
and is an important tool for data correlation and analysis. 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
19 
4.7.2.  Mission crewmembers will use AF Form 4146 or locally generated equivalent form to 
brief missions, record mission results, and serve as a record of unit and individual control 
activities.  (T-3)  ABMs and/or WDs will use the form to record all control activities conducted 
and will forward to the SL for review and signature.  (T-3)  The AF Form 4146 or equivalent 
form will be attached to AF Form 4145 and submitted to the unit Host Aviation Resource 
Management office, with guidance from 1C0X2 Guide for Ground Based Radar Air Battle 
Manager Duties, and DAFMAN 11-401, Aviation Management.  (T-3) 
4.8.  Operations Logbook.  The operations logbook is the official record of significant mission 
events that occurred during either in-garrison or real-world contingency operations.  When in-
garrison, the logbook will be maintained in accordance with squadron LOPs.  (T-3)  The purpose 
is to maintain an accurate and detailed record of all significant events pertaining to operations 
occurring during each mission crew shift or event.  Of primary importance are specific events that 
may result in subsequent investigations.  The logbook is not required for day-to-day training 
missions, but should be utilized for unit training exercises, field deployments, etc.  The operations 
logbook is contained in a permanently bound ledger or journal, or through electronic recording 
methods.  The SL will ensure the logbook is maintained exercising the following procedures: 
4.8.1.  Classification of the operations logbook or electronic medium will be marked to the 
highest classification of its content.  (T-3)  The logbook will be marked, handled, and stored 
in accordance with DoDM 5200.01V2 and AFMAN 16-1404V2.  (T-3) 
4.8.2.  The SL or the responsible individual designated by the SL will ensure the logbook is 
opened at 0001Z or at the beginning of the duty day and closed at 0000Z or the end of the duty 
day.  (T-3) 
4.8.3.  Record information not already noted and/or recorded in another authorized document 
or system unless it is deemed appropriate for clarity, understanding or classification.  (T-3) 
4.8.4.  Record time of each entry (ZULU time) and call signs of unit(s) sending and/or 
receiving information.  (T-3) 
4.8.5.  The SL or the responsible individual designated by the DO will annotate in the 
Operations Logbook their name and rank, crew position, and start/end time of their tour of 
duty.  (T-3)  This certifies all entries are accurate and reflect a complete record of the tour of 
duty.  (T-3) 
4.9.  Operations Mission Crew Aid Checklists.  Mission crew aid checklists (hereafter to be 
designated “crew aid checklists”) are a standard set of documents that contain pertinent 
information extracted from applicable sources to facilitate mission execution.  Crew aid checklists 
serve only as a guide and are not a substitute for directive guidance. 
4.9.1.  Crew aid checklists may contain as an example: charts, diagrams, unit and agency phone 
directories, unit listings, indexes, airspace and anchor depictions, and other unclassified 
reference information deemed useful to the conduct of mission planning and operations. 
4.9.2.  Crew aid checklists with approved ACC and unit supplemental materials, will be 
maintained, reviewed, and distributed in a manner deemed appropriate by the unit DO.  (T-3)  
They will be made available on position for unit command center (UCC) and TOC personnel, 
or each mission crewmember will be issued an individual copy.  (T-3)  However, it will be the 
20 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
individual mission crewmember’s responsibility to ensure the crew aid checklists are on-hand 
or on-position and used as appropriate.  (T-3) 
4.9.3.  Mark the classification of the crew aid checklists to the highest classification of its 
content.  The crew aid checklists will be marked, handled, and stored in accordance with 
DoDM 5200.01V2/AFMAN 16-1404V2 and 5200.01 Volume 3/AFMAN 16-1404 Volume 3, 
Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information.  (T-3) 
4.9.4.  ACC/A3CG is responsible for maintaining the master copy of mission crew aids.  The 
crew 
aids 
are 
available 
on 
the 
ACC/A3CG 
SharePoint® 
page 
at: 
https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/10680/SitePages/Home.aspx, filed under sub-file CRC Operations 
Information File (CRC OIF).  The crew aid checklists are designed and formatted to be 
incorporated into standard 4" x 7" flight crew binders. 
4.9.5.  ACC-approved crew aid checklists are placed in the front of the binder.  Unit 
supplemental material (e.g., LOPs, unit developed crew aid checklists) follow the ACC-
approved crew aid checklist format. 
4.9.6.  Each unit develops internal currency review procedures to ensure crew aid checklists 
are current and reviewed at least annually.  (T-3)  Procedures will designate the unit reviewing 
authority and the first page of each crew aid checklist binder contains the date of the last review 
of the total checklist and the initials of the reviewer.  (T-3)  The reviewer’s initials will signify 
the crew aids are current.  (T-3) 
4.9.7.  The crew aid checklist titled, “Controlled Aircraft Emergency,” will be the first crew 
aid checklist in any crew aid checklist binder.  (T-3) 
4.9.8.  Recommended changes or improvements to crew aid checklists are initiated by 
submitting a memorandum for record through appropriate channels (i.e., Group, NAF (as 
applicable)), to ACC/A3CG.  ACC/A3CG will review and approve or disapprove submitted 
recommendations and coordinate changes for incorporation.  Once changes are incorporated, 
the applicable crew aid checklist(s) are posted to the ACC/A3CG SharePoint® 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/10680/SitePages/Home.aspx).  ACC/A3CG, notifies National 
Guard Bureau (NGB) A3/10 and USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ who in turn notifies respective 
units of specific changes via separate memorandum and/or message. 
4.10.  Crew Force Management.  Proper manning, mission crewmember rest, fatigue 
management, and duty limitations are factors considered in effective mission crewmember 
management.  This section prescribes mission duty period, mission duty hours, and mandatory rest 
duration for CRC mission crewmembers.  Basic guidance for fatigue management strategies and 
waiver authority procedures follows: 
4.10.1.  Mission Duty Period.  Mission duty period will commence when the mission 
crewmember arrives at the duty location for the mission briefing, mission, or other official 
duty and ends when the crewmember departs the duty location.  (T-3)  The normal 
crewmember mission duty period will not exceed 14 hours.  (T-3)  The SL will ensure that 
instances of extended mission duty period will be annotated in the operations logbook, at a 
minimum detailing authorizing official (e.g., appropriate waiver authority), extenuating 
circumstances, and crewmember(s) affected.  (T-3) 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
21 
4.10.2.  Mission Duty Hours.  Mission duty hours are calculated as those hours within the 
mission duty period when a current, qualified mission crewmember performs the assigned 
mission on position. 
4.10.2.1.  Intermittent relief on-position crewmembers of mission duties are provided by 
qualified CMR and/or basic mission capable spare crewmember or MPC personnel for 
bathroom breaks and short mealtimes, etc.  Table 4.2 prescribes the maximum mission 
duty hours worked for the prescribed periods. 
4.10.2.2.  To mitigate fatigue issues for extended periods of operations greater than 30 
days, commanders should consider 10-hour shifts.  Refer to AFTTP 3-3.CRC for 
determining the number of shifts (e.g., two or three shift periods), and the shift cadence.  
The SQ/CC, DO, and SL must consider additional non-operational essential taskings in the 
overall planning of the personnel duty day.  (T-3) 
4.10.3.  Crewmember Rest.  Rest is compulsory for crewmembers prior to performing all 
duties involving operations and consists of a recommended minimum of 10 non-duty hours 
before the mission duty period begins.  Rest affords the crewmember free time and includes 
time for meals, transportation, and rest.  This time must include an opportunity for at least 8 
hours of uninterrupted sleep.  (T-3)  If any crewmember performs duties past the 1.5-hour 
period after crew debrief or other required crewmember duties, crewmember rest must not 
begin until post-positional duties are completed.  (T-3)  Each crewmember will be individually 
responsible to ensure he/she obtains sufficient rest during crewmember rest periods.  (T-3)  
The owning parent and/or deployed operations group commander may waive all or any part of 
a crewmember rest period. 
4.10.4.  Consumption of Alcohol.  Mission crewmembers will not perform CRC operational 
mission duties within 12 hours of consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or if 
impaired by alcohol or any other intoxicating substance.  (T-0) 
4.10.5.  Crew Scheduling.  CRC mission crewmembers should be prepared for surge 
operations.  Worst case scenario for initial operations provides the CRC in surge operations 
for indefinite periods of time.  The CRC mission capability statement provides two mission 
crews for 24-hour continuous surge operations (12-hour shifts) for a period of 7 days, after 
which one additional mission crew be provided through appropriate UTC deployment.  A 
fourth mission crew is provided at the 18th day for sustained operations for an indefinite period.  
Table 4.2 below provides guidance for allowable mission duty hours not to be exceeded to 
plan and employ a prudent schedule with available resources.

UNIT COMMAND CENTER (UCC) 
5.1.  Unit Command Center (UCC).  The UCC is established by the ACS/CCs to facilitate 
centralized support of unit operations.  The UCC facility is accommodated in an appropriate fixed 
or mobile shelter, and manned and equipped with unit personnel and equipment resources to allow 
the site support section and CFP sections to facilitate planning, directing, coordinating, and 
controlling mission operations and unit support activities.  The SQ/CC will equip the UCC with 
appropriate procedural and emergency and quick response checklists, and other appropriate 
guidance (e.g., unit LOPs), and doctrinal documentation needed to respond to the full range of 
military or civil operations.  (T-3) Table 5.1 below provides recommended UCC sections and 
manning from unit or augmentation resources as required for mission operations:

***RADC/SADC may also be resident in the UCC if not in the TOC. 
5.2.  Unit Command Center (UCC) Duties.  The SQ/CC and DO are ultimately responsible for 
the CRC’s execution of the CFACC or JFACC guidance (e.g., joint air operations plan, ATO, and 
airspace control order).  (T-3)  Through the AOC Chief of Combat Operations, the CC/DO 
provides mission direction from the UCC.  Units are not required to employ an in-garrison UCC, 
unless the CC or DO determines a large exercise or training event warrants employment.  The CC 
or DO (also possibly designated as the RADC/SADC), 1C5, and CFP are resident in the UCC. 
5.2.1.  Squadron Commander (SQ/CC), AF Specialty Code (AFSC) 13B3D, (Non-
waiverable), (Maj – Lt Col on G-series orders).  The SQ/CC will ensure facilitation, planning, 
direction, coordination, and control of maintenance, mission and support activities for both in-
garrison and deployed operations.  (T-3)  During tactical execution, the CRC is operationally 
subordinate to the AOC Chief of Combat Operations, and the SQ/CC is responsible for the 
CRCs implementing effective tactical battle management command and control (BMC2) by 
delegating proper execution authorities to internal CRC leadership (i.e., SL).  The SQ/CC 
and/or DO are responsible for the management and direction of tactical level BMC2 to include 
air defense and airspace control activities within the CRC battle management area.  The 
authority to execute operational control and/or tactical control of assigned weapons systems 
may be decentralized to the CRC by the AOC Chief of Combat Operations.  In addition to the 
commander ensuring the effective BMC2 of the forces assigned, the commander will execute 
the duties of SQ/CC in accordance with AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities.  (T-3)  In 
24 
AFMAN13-1CRCV3  26 APRIL 2024 
addition to authorities also delegated to the SQ/CC by the Area Air Defense Commander, the 
roles and responsibilities of the RADC and/or SADC may also be delegated to the SQ/CC, as 
guidance found in JP 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats. 
5.2.1.1.  The SQ/CC and DO will be active-duty AF or ANG field grade officers awarded 
the 13B3D AFSC from the Undergraduate ABM course, prior to assuming the duties of 
SQ/CC or DO.  The SQ/CC and DO will qualify as an ABM, certify as an SL, and meet 
and maintain training and positional requirements outlined in AFMAN 13-1CRCV1.  In 
addition, the SQ/CC and DO will perform prescribed duties as members of the UCC.  These 
requirements are non-waiverable. 
5.2.1.2.  The SQ/CC and DO may delegate authority to conduct operations to the SL as 
appropriate.  When the SQ/CC or DO is not present in the UCC, all delegated BMC2 
execution authorities (e.g., scramble, identification, commit, engagement, airspace control, 
border crossing, and mission reallocation) automatically transfer to the on-duty SL as 
appropriate. 
5.2.2.  Director of Operations (DO) (AFSC 13B3D, (Maj – Lt Col)).  The DO will, in support 
of the SQ/CC, be responsible to ensure operations personnel are trained, equipped, and 
available to execute the tasks associated with the unit’s mission.  (T-3)  The DO will create, 
manage, and execute a daily activity schedule assigning duties to mission crewmembers 
regardless of operating location.  (T-3)  The DO is responsible for ensuring personnel are 
assigned to operational mission crews and trained to a CMR or basic mission capable status in 
employing the AN/TYQ-23A, in both in-garrison and contingency environments.  The DO 
coordinates with the unit’s Chief of Maintenance for the effective employment of the radar, 
communications, and support systems to ensure effective accomplishment of mission 
requirements.  The DO may be delegated the directive authority by the SQ/CC to support UCC 
activity in the absence of the SQ/CC. 
5.2.3.  Region/Sector Air Defense Commander (RADC/SADC).  In the role of RADC/SADC 
as delegated, the CC or his/her delegate (i.e., DO or SL) must be prepared to exercise BMC2 
of an assigned regional area or sector for defensive counter air operations and assigned weapon 
systems, to include friendly fighters and air defense artillery units.  (T-3)  The RADC/SADC 
will direct the pairings of assets under CRC control for effective threat prosecution with further 
guidance from AFTTP 3-1.CRC and AFTTP 3-3.CRC.  (T-3)  The RADC/SADC must 
maintain the necessary situational awareness and communications links up to the AOC’s Area 
Air Defense Commander, CFACC or JFACC, or Joint Force Commander (JFC), down to the 
tactical units’ operation centers, and laterally to other RADC/SADC (if employed).  (T-3)  The 
SQ/CC, and/or DO and SL must also be prepared to handover the RADC/SADC role if the 
CRC is degraded in any way that would prevent it from fulfilling the function.  (T-3)  The SL,

MISSION CREW PROCEDURES 
6.1.  Mission Crew Overview.  The CRC total mission crewmember composition (i.e., BMT 
and/or SOT), and its effective employment is fundamental in providing BMC2, battle awareness, 
surveillance, identification, classification and tracking of all airborne tracks.  In addition, the 
defense of friendly assets, prosecution with assigned weapons of designated targets entering its 
area of responsibility and/or battle management area, and direct coordination with other BMC2 
elements is also imperative.  Table 6.1 depicts the notional manning for the CRC TOC and Table 
6.2 depicts the duty location and number of EPT personnel required.  BMT and/or SOT teams are 
organized under the SL and manned to meet tasked operational missions.  Table 6.3, depicts BMT 
and SOT standard manning and organization of the teams, but is always determined by the mission 
tasking and directed by the SL.

PERIODIC RADAR EVALUATION PROGRAM (PREP) 
A2.1.  The periodic Radar Evaluation Program (PREP).  In accordance with AFI 13-101, 
Evaluation of Ground Based Radar Systems and Sensors Supporting Command Control (C2) 
Enterprise, and ACC Supplements, the PREP provides unit leadership with a tool for determining 
the capability of each assigned radar to detect, identify, track and control aircraft.  Additionally, it 
determines aircraft height, permanent echoes, ground returns, clutter, radar performance 
parameters, and maximizes operational readiness ensuring maximum detection ranges and flight 
safety.  The PREP also determines the system configuration for optimal performance in a dynamic 
radar environment.  In support of the PREP, units will accomplish, but not be limited to the 
following: 
A2.1.1.  Establish a unit PREP task-certification program to include a positional certification 
for non-EPT certified individuals, in accordance with AFMAN 13-1CRC V1.  (T-3)  In 
addition to the EPT, individuals selected by the DO are trained and certified (i.e., vice 
qualified) to conduct daily in-garrison PREP assessment.  (T-3)  Upon completion of the 
certification program, the DO designates in writing the certification of trained individuals.  
(T-3) 
A2.1.2.  Provide an assessment of radar system effectiveness utilizing radar Preparation 
Worksheet at Figure A2.1.2 and record any deterioration of mission capability.  (T-3)  PREPs 
are conducted during both unit deployment and in-garrison operations using the PREP 
worksheet.  (T-3) 
A2.1.3.  Subjective Assessment: The PREP individual or EPT will evaluate radar quality.  
(T-3)  Base radar quality assessment on data analysis of information gathered on aircraft 
tracking, detection, permanent echoes, ground returns, clutter, radar performance parameters, 
weather conditions, and radar height readouts.  (T-3)  Assessment results are recorded using 
the radar Preparation Worksheet in Figure A2.1.  (T-3) 
A2.1.4.  The assessment of the radar is made at the beginning of each operations shift or in-
garrison training event by the certified PREP individual or EPT.  (T-3)  Results of completed 
assessment will be passed to the AST/SSO/MSO with a single word: satisfactory, marginal, or 
unsatisfactory.  (T-3)  Results will be recorded in the operations logbook.  (T-3) 
A2.1.6.  The PREP worksheet is maintained on file by the unit for a minimum of 60 days after 
completion and then destroyed.

VOICE TELL PROCEDURES 
A3.1.  Voice Tell.  When the CRC has been assigned a battle management area (BMA) where 
either the CRC is unable or coordinating BMC2 units are unable to conduct TDL operations, pre-
briefed voice tell procedures will be implemented.  (T-3)  Procedures will be in accordance with 
AFTTP 3-1.IPE and AFTTP 3-3.IPE, Attachment 1, and AFTTP 3-3.CRC, and CRC crew aids 
enabling the timely and accurate exchange of track information.  (T-3)  In addition, the following 
procedures will be implemented: 
A3.1.1.  The AST/SSO/MSO will coordinate with the SL to ensure an accurate common 
tactical picture is distributed over the TDL network or provide required voice tell as required.  
(T-3) 
A3.1.2.  The AST/SSO/MSO will pre-plan for dedicated STs/MSOs who are prepared to 
receive and/or transmit track data via voice tell format.  (T-3) 
A3.1.3.  In voice tell receive mode, the ST/MSO will utilize the pre-briefed tell formats and 
immediately initiate track data symbology prior to attempting to correlate the told-in track.  
(T-3) 
A3.1.4.  In both transmit or receive voice tell mode, the ST/MSO will be thoroughly briefed 
on the applicable remote agency call sign, communications frequencies, the track production 
area (TPA), and any other pertinent mission data.  (T-3) 
A3.1.5.  The CRC surveillance section will voice tell Priority One, Two, and Three tracks until 
the receiving agency directs cease tell.  (T-3)  The CRC voice tells all other priority (4 - 7) 
tracks by request only.  The following priority track classifications are established and 
generally universally accepted, but should be pre-coordinated with all agencies: 
A3.1.5.1.  Priority One – Hostile and/or Faker 
A3.1.5.2.  Priority Two – Unknown and/or Pending 
A3.1.5.3.  Priority Three – Emergencies 
A3.1.5.4.  Priority Four – Defensive Counter Air 
A3.1.5.5.  Priority Five – Very Important Person Flights 
A3.1.5.6.  Priority Six – Special Missions 
A3.1.5.7.  Priority Seven – All other Tracks as directed by the receiving agency (e.g., 
Neutralized Fakers). 
A3.1.5.8.  Voice tell will normally be in the United States Message Text Format Track 
Report, #F753 format, or as amended to meet mission requirements that is pre-coordinated 
with all agencies.  (T-3)  Voice Tell format will be in accordance with appropriate crew 
aids.  (T-3)
