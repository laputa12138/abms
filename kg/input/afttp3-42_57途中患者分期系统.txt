Chapter 1 
GENERAL 
1.1.  Purpose.  This document describes command relationships and publishes general guidance 
for the development of ERPSS capabilities supporting the Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) 
in contingency operations; theater operation plans (OPLANs) and humanitarian 
assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR).  Specific information to amplify and tailor guidance 
contained in this TTP is included in Technical Orders (TOs), OPLANs, or other regional 
guidance.  This TTP: (a) identifies and defines ERPSS responsibilities; (b) ensures ERPSS tasks, 
functions, and responsibilities are properly assigned; (c) describes the resources available to 
support global military operations associated with regional plans; and (d) provides a source 
document for developing standardized ERPSS policies, operating procedures, training programs 
and allowance standards (AS). 
1.2.  Background. 
1.2.1.  An AEF is a package of aerospace capabilities that provides tailored forces to meet 
theater requirements across the full spectrum of military operations.  AEF forces respond to 
sustainment and crisis action contingency operations.  The Air Force Medical Service 
(AFMS) provides medical capabilities to the AEF identified in unit type codes (UTCs) to 
support needed requirements.  As such, medical UTCs are assigned and deployed as the 
mission dictates.   
1.2.2.  Regarding medical capability, the Expeditionary Medical Support/Air Force Theater 
Hospital (EMEDS/AFTH) system is designed to provide essential care in a theater of 
operations to include deployment scenarios, war operations, deterrence and contingency 
operations, peacetime engagement, crisis response, and HA/DR.  Aeromedical Evacuation 
(AE) is necessary for patients who require definitive care not available in the EMEDS/AFTH.  
1.2.3.  Patient staging is a key component of ensuring timely AE.  Patient staging is designed 
to temporarily stage patients and prepare them for flight and aircraft loading while reducing 
the amount of time an AE aircraft is on the ground.  Prior to the ERPSS concept, staging 
patients for AE had historically been accomplished via MASFs, CASFs or Disaster 
Aeromedical Staging Facilities (DASFs).   
1.2.4.  In 2010, HQ AMC/SGX proposed re-structuring the CASF/MASF missions into the 
ERPSS.  In doing so, the UTCs have been combined into force modules (FM) to meet mission 
requirements.  Utilizing the ERPSS FMs, HQ AMC is able to accomplish patient staging from 
bare base operations to a 200-bed patient staging capability at fixed facilities and allow 
flexibility with ever changing operations.  The primary mission of the ERPSS is to provide 
personnel and equipment necessary for 24-hour staging operations for patients entering and 
transiting the Air Force components of the global AE system.  The ERPSS coordinates and 
communicates with medical and AE elements to accomplish patient care and patient 
movement (PM), including ground transportation.  It provides patient reception, complex 
medical/surgical nursing, limited emergent intervention, and ensures patients are medically 
and administratively prepared for flight.

AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
1.3.  Threat.  The ERPSS ability to function within a Medical Counter- Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, Nuclear (MC-CBRN) environment is very different than that of the EMEDS.  
There are no collectively protected ERPSS packages.  The AFMS has the capability to move one 
or two contagious “index” patients utilizing the Patient Isolation Unit (PIU).  This capability 
should not imply the need to have a collectively protected ERPSS package. 
1.3.1.  Medical Threat Implications. 
1.3.1.1.  Disease and Non-Battle Injury (DNBI).  Historically, DNBI accounted for over 
80 percent of personnel admitted to hospitals during contingency operations.  The 
medical community is exposed to a unique class of threats mitigated by infection control 
practices, which include, sharp needle/scalpel sticks, and exposure to infection through 
careless infection control procedures or neglect.  Personnel and patients, from high threat 
areas, may show signs of suspected or known highly infectious agents.  ERPSS personnel 
must be aware of possible signs and symptoms of these diseases as well as the 
appropriate public health response in these instances.  Proper emphasis of infection 
control practices should keep this threat to a minimum, but will require firm and 
sustained enforcement.  Safety is paramount in an environment where small injuries can 
become serious due to austere conditions.  Appropriate training of medical personnel 
during peacetime should mitigate these potential threats. 
1.3.1.2.  Conventional Weapons.  These weapons, including precision guided munitions, 
antipersonnel/vehicle mines, tube and rocket artillery, aerial bombs, cruise and ballistic 
missiles, and others carry the potential to inflict personal injury in widely varying 
degrees.  Treatment of injuries caused by these weapons is enhanced through advanced 
diagnostic capability, specialty consultation, medical information access, AE, and the 
ability to process tests and data rapidly.  ERPSS offers no protection from conventional 
(kinetic) weapons and requires protective shelters from Expeditionary Combat Support 
(ECS) sources. 
1.3.1.3.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  For definitive guidance on biological 
and chemical agents, and nuclear weapons and their effects, see JP 3-11, Operations in 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environments.  Refer to AFTTP 3-
42.22, Contagious Casualty Management, for the guidance regarding movement of 
contaminated/contagious casualties/personnel.  
1.3.1.3.1.  Biological and Chemical Weapons (BW/CW).  The possibility of 
biological or chemical attack poses a significant threat to deployed forces.  While 
there are EMEDS packages fitted with collective protection components to allow for 
continued operations in a contaminated environment, these same measures are not 
available for ERPSS packages.  Large scale PM does not normally occur in a 
contaminated environment.   
1.3.1.3.2.  Nuclear/Radiological Weapons.  These weapons range greatly in size and 
energy yield and are employed by a variety of means.  While blast and thermal injury 
will account for most casualties, radiation effects will also be significant.  A nuclear 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
7 
incident has the potential to produce a very large number of casualties 
instantaneously, severely burdening the medical evacuation and treatment system.  
ERPSS packages do not protect against radiation. 
1.3.2.  Information Warfare (IW).  Our heavy reliance on information systems makes them 
attractive targets to potential adversaries.  The threats to these systems are worldwide, 
technically diverse, and growing rapidly.  Network Control Center (NCC) Information 
Assurance (IA) programs provide information systems security support for the ERPSS.  The 
medical facility abides by the Air Force Forces/Air Expeditionary Task Force 
(AFFOR/AETF) Network Operation and Security Center–Deployed (NOSC-D) and NCC 
communications design architectures, operational rules of engagement, and MAJCOM 
preferred product lists to minimize the threat.

Chapter 2 
DESCRIPTION 
2.1.  Mission.  The ERPSS has a two-fold mission:  provide support and continuity of medical 
care for PM and serve as an integral patient interface to the Air Force components of the Global 
AE system.  The Global AE system consists of unregulated movement via Casualty Evacuation 
(CASEVAC), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), and/or AE from the point of patient injury, 
illness, or wounding, through successive roles within the theater, to include evacuation to 
definite care when warranted.  The ERPSS provides personnel and equipment necessary for 24-
hour patient staging operations, administrative processing and patient ground transportation 
between the staging facility and the aircraft.  
2.2.  Essential Care. 
2.2.1.  The ERPSS is designed to temporarily hold patients as they transit the AE system 
while providing short-term complex medical-surgical nursing care and limited emergent 
intervention.  The length of stay in an ERPSS facility may be from two to 72 hours.  Holding 
times differ depending on the size of the staging facility.  At the 10-bed initial stage, holding 
times are limited by the amount of space and supplies in this initial package.  Two to four 
hours is the preferred hold time; not to exceed six hours.  At the larger staging facilities (50-
100 bed), holding times will vary depending on the operational capability of the location and 
the flight schedules, but should be limited to no more than 72 hours.   
2.2.2.  Complex medical/surgical nursing is defined as utilizing multiple skill sets when 
caring for patients with wide-ranging traumatic injury, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
genitourinary, neurological and multi-system pathologies.  Skill sets include, but are not 
limited to, managing multiple intravenous (IV) or central lines; administering numerous IV 
medications and blood products; performing wound irrigations and dressing changes; and 
assisting with placement and management of chest tubes.  Additionally, knowledge of flight 
considerations for trauma and medical patients and the stresses of flight are important in this 
environment. 
2.2.3.  Complex care does not represent critical care.  Critically ill patients will be cared for at 
the nearest/supporting Military Treatment Facility (MTF).  The co-located or supporting 
inpatient MTF is responsible for holding/staging all patients with medical care requirements 
outside the scope of the ERPSS.  In the event that the ERPSS cannot be geographically co-
located with a supporting MTF and the MTF Chief of Medical Staff determines the distance 
to be significant, emergent care personnel, such as a Critical Care Air Transport Teams 
(CCATT), may be co-located with the ERPSS to assist in stabilizing patients. 
2.2.4.  All ERPSS facilities (with the exception of the ERPSS-10) should be co-located with a 
theater hospital level MTF to support patient treatment and movement.  It can be a stand-
alone facility with providers, nursing personnel and flight surgeons assigned to assist in 
stabilizing patients for movement in the Global AE system.  If the ERPSS facility is not co-
located with an MTF that can provide the required clinical support, arrangements must be in 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016

place to meet the clinical support levels needed for patients transiting the facility (host nation, 
local civilian authorities, or Joint Service counterparts).    
2.3.  Assumptions. 
2.3.1.  Populations-at-risk (PAR) represent contingency/disaster support personnel or 
international military and civilian personnel in a coalition operation.  US military population 
supported will have predeployment medical screening, prophylaxis, immunizations and will 
be trained in Self Aid Buddy Care (SABC). 
2.3.2.  Airlift is available. 
2.3.3.  Patients are evacuated IAW the theater evacuation policy. 
2.3.4.  AE capabilities support rapid movement of stabilized patients. 
2.3.4.1.  Patient Evacuation.  IAW AF directives and Combatant Commander directives, 
patient medical supplies and patient movement items (PMI) may be prepositioned to meet 
patient movement requirements.  If not prepositioned, the originating facility will be 
responsible for providing these items and should provide a one-day minimum of supplies 
for PM within the Continental United States (CONUS) or three-day minimum of supplies 
for outside the CONUS (OCONUS) moves.  
2.3.5.  Deployed medical forces may not be able to depend on host-nation medical support. 
2.3.6.  ECS, including but not limited to communications, fuel, potable water, ice, electrical 
power, transportation, living quarters for medical personnel, food service, base security, 
protective shelters, site preparation, pallet movement, wastewater disposal, and human and 
medical waste disposal, is provided.   
2.4.  ERPSS FM Builds/Doctrine.  ERPSS is a medical war reserve materiel (WRM) supply 
and equipment asset, with a building construct that allows medical planners to right size the 
facility requirements based on PM requirements.  The ERPSS builds from a 10-bed mobile 
facility (FFEPS).  As workload changes, or is projected to change, UTC packages (personnel and 
equipment) may be deployed in small increments and combined with previously deployed 
ERPSS UTCs to increase capability.   
2.5.  Incremental Build of the ERPSS from 10 to 200 Beds.  Figures 2.1 and 2.2 demonstrate 
the incremental build from a 10-bed to 200-bed ERPSS FM.  What follows are descriptions of 
the UTCs contained within the ERPSS FM.  It is important to note vehicles (HMMWVs, 
AMBUS, M1078 Truck and 10K Forklift) must be tasked separately in support of ERPSS 
operations, as they are not part of the UTC AS (per the Mission Capability Statement 
[MISCAP]).   
2.5.1.  ERPSS-10.  This UTC is the first increment in building all ERPSS assemblages.  The 
staging facility maintains the flexibility to be a mobile or fixed capability.

AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
2.5.1.1.  ERPSS-10 Personnel UTC (FFEPS).  This UTC is a 13-person, ten-bed 
capability that provides rapid response patient staging of ten patients at a time, a 
maximum flow of 40 patients in a 24-hour period, and a maximum six hour patient hold 
time.  Team should be able to sustain this tempo for 72 hours without augmentation.

as rolling stock (if the UFMVH UTC is tasked) or on aircraft pallets (463L).  If this UTC 
is not deployed as rolling stock, it cannot be considered mobile.  This UTC comes with 
heating capability; however, the ERPSS-10 Environmental Control Unit (FFPS7) UTC 
must be tasked to add a cooling capability. 
2.5.1.3.  ERPSS-10 AE Communication Team (FFQCR).  For the ERPSS-10, this two 
person AE communication team (FFQCR) must be tasked separately for communications 
support.  This UTC does not normally deploy with the 50, 100, or 200 bed ERPSS 
packages.  For the 50, 100, or 200 bed ERPSS packages, communications support is an 
ECS responsibility. 
2.5.1.4.  ERPSS-10 Vehicle Support (UFMVH), High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled 
Vehicle (HMMWV).  These two light, highly mobile, diesel-powered, four-wheel-drive 
vehicles are equipped with an automatic transmission and are required for the ERPSS-10 
to deploy as rolling stock.  These vehicles must be tasked in addition to the ERPSS-10 
(FFPS1) equipment package, per the MISCAP. 
2.5.1.5.  ERPSS-10 Environmental Control Unit (ECU) (FFPS7, AS 904J).  Provides an 
ECU and augmentation equipment/generator to provide basic heating/cooling 
environment capability to the ERPSS. 
2.5.1.6.  ERPSS-10 Re-supply (FFPS8, AS 904K).  Provides 15-day re-supply for 
employed ERPSS-10 based on 40 patients per 24 hours.  When combined with ERPSS-10 
Equipment UTC (FFPS1), this package provides an initial 22 day capability to support 
PM.  Re-supply arrives on 463L pallets.  If package is repositioned, receiving unit is 
required to have ground support (10K forklift) to transport re-supply package to new 
location.   
2.5.2.  ERPSS-P Personnel UTC (FFPPS).  This 10-person UTC provides clinical providers, 
additional nursing staff, and logistical support to enhance the clinical capability for any 
ERPSS UTC.  Serves as a clinical interface capability between forward medical care and the 
ERCC.  Can be deployed with or as a follow on to the ERPSS-10.  The ERPSS-P can deploy 
independently to support the EMEDS where staging is deliberately planned.  Larger builds 
require deployment of this UTC in combination with other UTCs to form the various 
packages. 
 
2.5.3.  ERPSS-50 thru 200 Bed Capabilities.  The ERPSS-50/100 UTCs provide staging 
capabilities for 50 and 100 bed stages.  Patient stays at this level should be limited to 72 hours 
or IAW theater operations policy.  When supporting an EMEDS, other service theater 
hospitals, or CONUS MTFs, patients can remain in the facility as space and staging 
requirements allow, depending on the casualty flow, nature of the injuries, availability of AE 
resources, and requirements of the mission.  For robust AE and staging missions, patient stays 
are reduced to 12 hours, thereby increasing throughput capability due to projected use of 
retrograde airlift, civilian hospitals, air ambulances, and other-than-AE lift options.   
2.5.3.1.  These configurations have more complete services than the ERPSS-10 and the  
ERPSS-P.  Physician, biomedical equipment repair, administration, and logistics services

are components of larger personnel packages.  ERPSS-50/100 requires MTF support for 
nutritional medicine, pharmacy, mental health and intensive care nursing.  If an ERPSS-
50/100 is located with an MTF that does not have in-house food service, a support 
agreement is to be established with base food service for patient feeding, addressing 
specific therapeutic food items required for patients.   
2.5.4.  ERPSS-50. 
2.5.4.1.  ERPSS-50 Personnel UTC (FFFPS).  This 28-person UTC is used as a bed 
extension/augmentation package for patient staging.  It administratively and clinically 
prepares patients for flight and ensures patients are clinically supported while in the 
ERPSS.  This UTC assists with the transportation of patients to and from the aircraft.  
Builds with other ERPSS UTCs, or can be tasked to augment PM at other echelons of 
care.  If ECS is limited, planners should add provisions for personnel with expertise in 
Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) setup and management for generator, electrical 
grid and lighting. 
2.5.4.2.  ERPSS-50 Equipment UTC (FFPS2, AS 904G).  This UTC provides operational 
equipment, computers, radios, C2, generator and essential medical equipment and 
advanced cardiac life support medications.  It is used to build from the 50-bed capability 
to the 200-bed capability.  One ERPSS - 50 equipment package supports the ERPSS-
50/200.  The UTC is used in conjunction with the ERPSS Expendables (FFPS3) and 
ERPSS Facility (FFPS4) packages to complete the initial ERPSS-50 (See Figures 2.1 and 
2.2, pages 9 and 10).  ECS or Host Nation base support is required for medical equipment 
repair, bioenvironmental engineering (BE), security, petroleum/oil/lubricants (POL), and 
civil engineering (CE).

Chapter 3 
OPERATIONS 
3.1.  Introduction.  Medical operations occur within five distinct phases:  deployment, 
employment, generation/sustainment, redeployment, and reconstitution.  Each phase is 
delineated by mission objectives, PAR, and operational objectives.  Overall, the health services 
support objective is to enhance force protection by providing a modular, clinically enhanced, 
tailored and more life-saving capability while reducing the medical footprint. 
3.2.  General Policies. 
3.2.1.  The ERPSS UTCs are postured against sourced units in the UTC Availability Tool 
(UTA). ERPSS equipment/facility infrastructure packages may be pre-positioned in theater 
based on Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCC) and AFFOR requirements. 
3.2.2.  The ERPSS is employed according to the requirement dictated by the Joint component 
surgeon, in support of (ISO) the Combatant Commander’s (CCDR) OPLAN.  The ERPSS is 
considered a Combat Services Support (CSS) function when deployed in a Joint environment, 
the same category as user service medical elements.  The ERPSS needs to be positioned to 
fulfill its mission at the same time the user service is positioning its own CSS medical 
elements.  Delivery methods used by user services for positioning combat support elements 
vary.  CSS elements may be inserted via air/land delivery when the airfield is considered 
secured enough for placing these elements.  They may also follow combat forces via ground 
convoy, according to the CCDR’s plan.  Determining the insertion method of the ERPSS is a 
responsibility of the AF planner, as dictated by the Joint component surgeon, and in keeping 
with the ERPSS’s operational function, and support requirements.  
3.2.3.  ERPSS personnel are required to be knowledgeable of Joint service operations and are 
employed at operating locations where forward resuscitative capability and fixed/rotary wing 
airfields are available.  Members should be familiar with all references to the  Global AE 
system as referenced in Joint Publication 3-17, Air Mobility Operations, and Joint Publication 
4-02, Health Service Support.  The ERPSS supports medical elements of the US Army, US 
Navy, US Marine Corps, US Air Force, other coalition force medical elements and may be 
tasked ISO HA/DR and DSCA operations.  The Medical Service Corp Officer (41A) and 
Medical Admin (4AO) assigned to FFEPS will complete the following Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) courses:  IS-100, Introduction to Incident Command System, 
IS-700, National Incident Management System – An Introduction and IS-800, National 
Response Framework or the Air Force Response Operations, Introduction (AERO) web-based 
training.   The training is located at http://training.fema.gov/IS/crslist.aspx.  satisfies this 
requirement.  Other ERPSS personnel in leadership positions are recommended, but not 
required, to complete the same FEMA training. 
3.3.  ERPSS Support for the Global Patient Movement Plan (GPMP).  The GPMP may be 
activated to facilitate significant global PM.  In many instances, an existing MTF will need 
staging and holding capability and be able to support a small staging component through existing 
resources such as physician support, nutritional medicine, logistics, mental health, and pharmacy.  
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016

3.4.  Deployment. 
3.4.1.  Deployment planning and preparation is essential to support ERPSS operational 
objectives during contingencies and must afford sufficient command emphasis to ensure unit 
readiness.  The deployment can include a movement of troops, cargo, weapons systems, or a 
combination of these elements, utilizing multiple types of transport.  ECS must provide the 
goods and services to sustain the operations of a deployed ERPSS force package for the 
duration of a deployment.  The planners and initial ERPSS UTC personnel arrange messing, 
billeting, petroleum oil lubricants (POL), real estate and other support requirements for 
deployed medical elements. 
3.4.1.1.  The Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) is built by the air 
component and flowed through the MAJCOMs to the Wing plans and operations centers 
for action.  Local installation Deployment Control Centers (DCC) establishes local 
schedules to prepare units, personnel, and cargo IAW required delivery dates in theater.  
Schedules are developed by working backward from an “aircraft commander briefing” or 
“station” time to include the essential steps in the deployment process (i.e., manifesting, 
subsistence palletizing, marshaling, personnel processing, and assembly of personnel and 
cargo at unit assembly areas).  
3.4.1.2.  Deployment Timelines. 
3.4.1.2.1.  Regular Air Force (RegAF) ERPSS-10 and the ERPSS-P UTCs have the 
ability to rapidly deploy within 24 hours of notification. 
3.4.1.2.2.  Once all mobilization actions have been completed, ARC forces must be 
ready for deployment within 72 hours.  
3.4.2.  Cargo Processing.  The processing of ERPSS cargo begins immediately after a unit is 
tasked for deployment (notification stage), and continues until the cargo arrives at the 
deployed destination.  The DCC will publish the Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE) 
which demonstrates the unit’s deployment process, detailing critical deployment actions 
required to meet movement departure times.   
3.4.3.  Equipment Preparation.  When notified of a deployment tasking, equipment and 
supplies must be ready and prepared for transport.  Units should have checklists and/or 
flowcharts to assure procedures are followed for deployment of personnel and cargo.  
Equipment mobility paperwork packages contain load and packing lists, hazardous materials 
declarations, and hazardous cargo placards IAW AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support.  It is 
essential that all man-portable equipment for the ERPSS is kept in the “ready mode” at all 
times. 
3.4.4.  Personnel Preparation.  Personnel assigned to the ERPSS should be fully trained and 
ready to deploy prior to entering their deployment “band” or continuously ready for those 
assigned as an “enabler.”  Upon notification of deployment, the deploying team leader will 
coordinate with their assigned MTF medical readiness office staff, schedule a predeployment 
conference, and then review key documents and responsibilities.  Key documents include: 
18 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
deployment orders, TPFDD, force protection threats, medical intelligence reports, and overall 
intelligence reports.  Please refer to Chapter 9 of this TTP for an inclusive list of training 
requirements.  
3.4.5.  Medical Intelligence.  During the deployment phase, the team will obtain a detailed 
medical intelligence assessment for deployment briefings and inclusion in the force protection 
plan from the Base Public Health Office.  Sources for this information may include the 
MAJCOM medical and AE Plans and Readiness divisions, host base and theater intelligence, 
Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), National Center for Medical Intelligence 
(NCMI), Medical Environmental Disease Intelligence and Countermeasures (MEDIC) CD-
ROM data base, airfield surveys reports, Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS), 
published lessons learned/after action reports, Department of State, and any in-country US 
embassy or consulate.   
3.5.  Employment: 
3.5.1.  The ERPSS personnel should have a plan for rapidly setting up and taking down all 
equipment.  Pack equipment like radios/antenna and tents where they will be quickly 
assessable when arriving at the deployed site.  This allows the element to become operational 
and begin casualty flow at the earliest possible time.  Equipment UTC pack-out guides (if 
applicable) are available in the MEFPAK Playbook located at 
https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/27468/default.aspx . 
3.5.2.  Upon arrival at a deployed location, an ERPSS representative should immediately 
make contact with supporting organizations command elements, medical commanders, 
Contingency Response Groups (CRG) or Combat Control Team (CCT), airfield managers and 
brief the ERPSS capabilities, function, and ECS requirements.  Final site selection, operating 
perimeter, air base security plans are extremely important and must be reviewed and 
coordinated with supporting authorities. 
3.5.2.1.  ERPSS-10/ERPSS-P Employment. 
3.5.2.1.1.  The ERPSS-10/ERPSS-P are employed within a defined Area of 
Operations (AO) ISO contingency operations.  These UTCs are capable of relocating 
in a minimal amount of time as contingency operations dictate.  Leadership is 
required to interface with all local and host activities that provide ancillary support 
services.  This relationship is critical to ensure that the UTC’s can provide effective 
PM support to user service medical teams, and that reciprocal support needed to 
sustain operations is provided.   
3.5.2.1.2.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the ERPSS-10 and ERPSS-P 
should be achieved within one hour of arrival at the assigned location.  IOC is defined 
as the initial ability to provide immediate reception of patients and establishment of a 
communication link to the supporting Air Operations Center (AOC), AE Control 
Team (AECT) and servicing Patient Movement Requirement Center (PMRC) to 
coordinate PM.   
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
19 
3.5.3.  General Site Survey and Selection.  Aspects of site survey/selection process apply to all 
deployed elements.  A crucial step in the establishment of any airfield operation is 
determining where to establish the site,tent orientation and equipment placement.  Proper 
assessment of the terrain and physical surroundings is critical and is required to be 
accomplished correctly to avoid setting up operations on an unsuitable site.  At the operating 
location, the ERPSS-10 should be physically located to afford ready access to active 
taxiways/runways as feasible, while the ERPSS-50 to ERPSS-100 UTCs should be located in 
close proximity to the nearest medical facility.  This promotes rapid patient enplaning 
operations and supports the overall air mobility mission by minimizing aircraft ground-times 
and delays.  Guidance for airfield safety clearances when operating near active taxiways or 
runways can be found in Attachment 8.  The team chief appoints the site survey team to 
survey those areas of the proposed site based on their expertise.  Note:  Prior to beginning the 
site survey/selection process, the team chief needs to first coordinate with airfield 
management authorities or supporting units.  See ERPSS-10 SITE ESTABLISHMENT 
Attachment 6 for additional guidance, to include the criticality of good drainage for tents.  
3.5.3.1.  Personal/Site Camouflaging.  When camouflaging is deemed necessary for Force 
Protection (FP), personnel need to take into consideration the threat, time of year, 
climate, and the natural surroundings.  Skin should be covered using camouflage face 
paint, paint sticks, mud, or any other suitable material.  All areas of the head, neck, face, 
hands, throat, ears, and any other exposed skin areas are to be covered.  Sleeves will be 
rolled down.  Shiny areas of the face, which includes the forehead, nose, cheekbones, and 
chin, should be subdued using darker colors like dark green, brown, and black.  Personnel 
should remove or cover all reflective items such as rings, watches, earrings, etc.  
Personnel should use branches, leaves, or other local vegetation to break up outlines for 
themselves and their equipment.  Vehicles and equipment should be dispersed to the 
maximum extent possible.  Vehicle windows and mirrors will need to be appropriately 
covered or concealed to avoid reflections from the sun, moon, and other light sources.  
Camouflaged netting should be used to the maximum extent possible.  Commanders  
must understand that if personnel, facilities and equipment are camouflaged, any 
protection these would receive under the Geneva Conventions as “marked” medical 
personnel, facilities or equipment is foreited.  While not a war crime to camouflage – 
there may be a operational reasons for doing so – it does not then equate to a LOAC 
violation if an adversary strikes those being unaware of any protected status. 
3.5.3.2.  Hardening Assets and Building Safe Defensive Fighting Positions and Bunkers.  
Tents, POL, and generators should be hardened as much as possible, when FP conditions 
require.   Generators should be located at least 50 feet from the work/sleeping areas.  The 
generator power cable should be buried in the ground.  Generators should be shielded on 
all sides with sandbags to a height equal with the uppermost portion of the generator.  
This shielding or revetment should be big enough to allow free air ventilation and 
movement around the generator.  Tents should be bunkered a minimum 3 ft. high by 3 ft. 
deep with 3 ft. of clearance between the tent and sandbags.  This allows for additional 
cover for personnel outside, adequate cover for personnel inside the tent, free air 
ventilation and helps suppress light from the bottom of the tent during blackout 
conditions.  The tentage doorways should have a protective barrier in front approximately 
20 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
8 to 10 feet from the entrance/exit.  This allows for some protection from blasts and small 
arms fire while providing space for litter casualty movement.  The ratio of bunkers to 
personnel should be at least one bunker for every five to seven personnel.  Whether it is 
provided by the user service or built by UTC personnel, the quantity of fighting positions 
and bunkers should be adequate to support all personnel.  Assignments to them should be 
made to prevent overcrowding.  Defensive fighting positions should be dug armpit deep.  
Bunker walls should be at least three feet wide by four feet high.  To increase the height 
of the interior space, dig into the ground.  Use available resources to cover the bunker.  
These need to be supported by dunnage or interior walls built into the bunker.  A 
protective layer of sandbags at least two bags thick will be placed on the roof.  The 
placement of a protective wall in front of the doorway will further protect against blasts 
or debris.   
3.5.3.3.  Initial Site Security.  Security for ERPSS personnel and resources within the 
immediate area of each deployed location is the responsibility of the host installation.  
ERPSS-10/ERPSS-P should arrive at a forward operating location with the expectation 
that it may be a semi-secure airfield and be prepared to set-up area defense prior to 
establishing the facility There may be little or no time to prepare for hostile action in the 
area.  Every situation will be different and actions will be determined by all available 
information, such as intelligence reports and personal observation.  Threats should dictate 
actions taken.  Personnel should always use good judgment, err on the side of caution, 
and maintain a tactical posture whenever deployed.  Guards should be posted for 
adequate safety and defense. 
3.5.3.3.1.  Defensive Fighting Position.  When an area defense must be quickly 
established, personnel should post a guard or guards;  immediately prepare hasty 
fighting positions (shallow depressions or holes roughly 18 inches deep and long 
enough for the body), and identify fields of fire.  Continue to refine fighting positions, 
increasing survivability with more advanced positions as situation, mission, and time 
dictate. 
3.5.3.3.2.  ERPSS personnel engaged exclusively in medical duties are non-
combatant;  however, personnel may be armed as dictated by theater instructions.  
Facility security for asset protection, entry control, personal protection, and patient 
protection is performed by armed ERPSS personnel IAW the Law of Armed Conflict 
and Geneva Conventions.  Though ERPSS personnel are armed IAW theater 
requirements, the ERPSS does not have forces assigned for security, other than 
installation security limited to protection of assets, regulation of access, and 
Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) sweeps.  Security for personnel and patients 
against enemy aggressors is primarily the responsibility of, and should be provided 
by, the host installation commander.  Security for patients and personnel resources 
within the immediate area at each deployed medical site is a medical responsibility.  
Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW) patients are the responsibility of security forces 
personnel, not medical personnel.  Medical personnel are issued small arms IAW AFI 
31-117, Arming And Use Of Force By Air Force Personnel.   Deployed medical site 
assets, such as narcotics, are protected as a controlled area IAW AFI 31-101, 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
21 
 
 
Integrated Defense.  Additional force protection measures should be determined by 
the Deployed Medical Commander (DMC) or Senior Medical Officer (SMO) based 
upon Force Protection Condition (FPCON) and the advice of the Defense Force 
Commander (DFC).    
3.5.3.3.3.  Entry Control Points (ECPs).  ECPs should be established in the same 
manner as those on the flight line.  They are not designed to keep people out but to 
give controlled access to authorized personnel.  Anyone entering the ERPSS area not 
using an ECP should be considered “unfriendly” until proven otherwise. 
3.5.3.3.4.  Code Words.  Sign/Countersign, authentication codes and duress words 
should be used at all ECPs as the FP conditions dictate.  The host installation FP 
Office is responsible for generating these requirements; however, ERPSS personnel 
may need to establish these items upon arrival until the host installation FP Office is 
functional.  Follow AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual, for further guidance.  A 
duress code should be established.  This is a word or phrase used during the 
challenge/reply sequence to alert the guard that the member is under duress from an 
enemy, e.g., gun pointed at member by enemy, but is out of sight of the guard.  
Numbers equal to an established sum may also be used.  All challenge/responses 
should be given in a clear voice, just loud enough to be heard. 
3.5.3.3.5.  Running Passwords.  A running password should be made for times of 
emergencies when the conventional challenge/reply would be too time consuming.  A 
running password is used when a "friendly" member is being pursued by enemy 
forces into the compound.  The running password identifies the "friendly" and alerts 
the guards the enemy is right behind them.  It requires no reply from the guards and 
should be shouted repeatedly by the incoming "friendly”.  The guards will 
immediately take up defensive positions and fields of fire once the "friendly" has 
entered the camp area.  Make sure the camp is quickly alerted by any means 
available. 
3.5.3.3.6.  Buddy System.  ERPSS personnel, who transit outside the area’s defined 
security perimeter, will not do so alone.  ERPSS personnel who transit outside the 
area’s defined security perimeter will do so in compliance with established force 
protection measures.  The ERPSS leadership may consider implementation of a 
‘wingman concept’ that requires personnel to travel outside the security perimeter in 
pairs as threat conditions warrant/require. 
3.5.3.4.  General Evasive Plan of Action (Bug-out).  During contingency operations, 
escape and evasion routes and procedures will need to be established with other elements 
at the deployed location to ensure all personnel are prepared in case of an emergency.  
All PM elements will coordinate with the supporting collocated user service to see if an 
evasive plan of action has been established.  The ERPSS personnel need to be identified 
and included in the plans.  The team chief will ensure the security of personnel and 
equipment are taken into consideration by the user service.  If one has not been 
developed, assure a simple and direct plan is communicated.  Disseminate this to all 
22 
 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
personnel on what items to take, which vehicles or aircraft to go in, and make sure routes 
are specifically drawn out.  Map, compass, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) training is 
highly desirable for all personnel. 
3.5.3.4.1.  Fire Evacuation Plan.  Each deployed element will develop a fire 
evacuation plan.  This plan will include, at a minimum, a plan to egress the physical 
structure or location, assembly point, and personnel accountability.  Additionally, the 
plan will address the accountability for classified documents, encryption devices and 
weapons. 
3.5.3.4.2.  Base Recovery after Attacks.  Designate specific sweep areas, sector 
assignments, and marking procedures for your recovery teams.  Assure processes are 
in place to quickly notify your area control element on the status of recovery 
assessments and accountability of all personnel. 
3.5.3.5.  Survivability/Separation of Assets.  A crucial step in the survivability of all 
elements in a hostile environment is the separation of all assets and/or the location and 
protection of manpower and resources.  It is important to remember that to survive in 
austere and hostile environments, effectively separating your assets and properly 
camouflaging them will limit the amount of collateral damage sustained in the event of an 
attack.  All assets, such as tents, generators, vehicles, personnel, POL, food, water, 
supplies, and equipment should be separated as much as possible when threat conditions 
warrant such actions to minimize loss of resources and personnel from a hostile action, 
such as mortar or artillery attack, or individual sabotage.  All supplies, medical and non-
medical, should be kept, stored, concealed, and secured at all times. 
3.5.4.  Emergency Communications.  ERPSS team members should coordinate with user 
service regarding the type of communications available for early warning of changes in 
chemical and FPCON conditions (i.e. flags, Land Mobile Radios (LMR), sirens, horns, 
whistles, voice levels) as well as phones installed in the bunkers for emergency use (when 
bunkers are required).  When personnel are required to gather in one or more bunkers, an 
emergency communication system is essential to ensure all personnel are accounted for.  The 
team chief of the element should establish procedures of notification, accounting, and 
evacuation of personnel.  
3.5.5.  AGE.  AGE includes generators and heaters.  Electrical power sustains our vital 
communication links, medical equipment, lighting, computers, and other equipment as 
needed.  In order to operate AGE equipment safely, team members need to have knowledge 
about placement, set up and operation of the equipment, recognize gauge reading and know

COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)  
4.1.  HQ AMC/SG Responsibility.  HQ AMC/SG maintains MEFPAK responsibility and has 
overall responsibility for ERPSS policy.  As the UTC MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA), 
HQ AMC/SG will designate medical units to support ERPSS teams.  HQ AMC/SG is also 
responsible for the UTC coordination and validation process.  The AEF Center will source units 
to support ERPSS deployment taskings. 
4.1.1.  AMC.  Inter-Theater AE forces normally remain under the Operational Control 
(OPCON) of United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), delegated downward 
within AMC to 18th Air Force (18 AF) with planning, tasking and execution accomplished by 
the 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) (618 AOC 
(TACC)).  Intra-Theater AE forces are normally under the OPCON of the CCDR, delegated 
downward to the Theater Air Operations Center (AOC) with planning, tasking and execution 
accomplished by the AE Control Team (AECT) and AOC. 
4.1.2.  Pilot Unit.  The pilot unit is responsible for assisting in the development of and 
maintenance of standard manpower and logistics detail for all ERPSS UTCs IAW AFI 10-401 
Chapter 5, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.  The goal is a uniform and capable 
package for all ERPSS teams. 
4.1.3.  MDG/CC.  For Medical Groups with the assigned ERPSS teams, the MDG/CCs and 
affiliated  Air Reserve Component (ARC) units are required to maintain the approved 
AFTTPs to ensure team members are appointed, trained, and ready for deployment.  The 
MDG/CC is required to provide support to ensure successful training, predeployment 
planning, deployment and redeployment, and after action reporting. 
4.1.4.  MTF Medical Readiness.  The Medical Readiness office staff is responsible for 
identifying personnel shortages and reporting readiness of UTCs assigned as directed in          
AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management. 
4.2.  Command and Control (C2). 
4.2.1.  C2 is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over 
assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.  For definitive guidance 
reference AFI 13-103, AFFOR Staff Operations, Readiness and Structures.  C2 functions are 
performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and 
procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling 
forces and operations for mission accomplishment. 
4.3.  Joint Force Structure. 
4.3.1.  Unified Command Surgeon.  The Unified Command Surgeon establishes theater 
medical policy, theater evacuation policy, requirements, and medical Concepts of Operations 
(CONOPs) and communicates these matters through the AFFOR Surgeon to the deployed 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
39 
 
 
medical units.  The chain of command for expeditionary medical units is through the Line of 
the Air Force (LAF). 
4.3.2.  Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).  The COMAFFOR provides unity of 
command.   To a Joint Force Commander, the COMAFFOR provides a single face for all Air 
Force issues.  Within the Air Force Servie component, the COMAFFOR is the single 
commander who conveys commander’s intent and is responsible for operating and supporting 
all Air Force forces assigned or attached to that joint force. 
4.3.2.1.  A medical officer is a member of the COMAFFOR special staff and is the 
director of AF health services operations.  This medical officer may be known as the 
AFFOR Surgeon and is responsible for overall health resources management and 
provides information on health surveillance and risk assessments, sustainment, and other 
force health protection issues.  In coordination and planning for overall health service 
support, the AFFOR Surgeon will engage with both LAF and SG assets to ensure 
integrated PM and staging processes.  The AFFOR Surgeon does not exercise command 
authority over deployed medical assets but provides a planning, coordinating, and 
oversight role. 
4.3.3.  Multinational or United Nations (UN) Operations C2.  C2 of medical operations in 
multinational or UN operations are defined in the warning, execution, and operations orders.  
Service component planners establish medical requirements and relay them through existing 
tasking messages/mechanisms to MAJCOMs and wings. 
4.4.  C2 Relationships. 
4.4.1.  Aeromedical Evacuation Liaison Team (AELT).  If assigned, the AELT works with the 
user MTF (AF Expeditionary Medical Support, Army Combat Support Hospital or Navy Fleet 
Hospital for example) to facilitate patient staging and assists/inputs patient information into a 
PMR via TRAC2ES in preparation for PM.  The AELT directs patient on-load activities (in 
the absence of an AE Operations Team), provides AE related support services, and interfaces 
with all local and host activities that provide ancillary AE mission support services.  The 
AELT possesses a vehicle and can move with the supported MTF to a new operating location.   
4.4.2.  Air Mobility Division (AMD).  The Theater AMD generates the aircraft and aviation 
crews in preparation for PM. 
4.4.3.  Patient Movement Requirement Center (PMRC).  Provides clinical and administrative 
validation for PM via the VFS.  They coordinate PM by matching patients to the most 
effective AE mission. 
4.4.4.  Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Team (AEOT).  Provides management and 
direction of assigned, attached and transiting AE crews, CCATTs and associated equipment.  
The team works directly with the AOC and PMRC to coordinate AE missions and ensure on-
time launch and recovery.  
 
40 
 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
4.4.4.1.  The ERPSS will communicate with the AEOT to coordinate PM. 
4.4.5.  ERPSS-10/ERPSS-P. 
4.4.5.1.  When the ERPSS-10 and  ERPSS-P are deployed, they may fall under the 
OPCON and Tactical Control (TACON) of the Joint Force Air Component Commander 
(JFACC)/Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) exercised through the Director of 
Mobility Forces-Air (DIRMOBFOR-AIR) and may be assigned to a deployed AE 
element.  During exercise participation, OPCON/TACON will be outlined in the 
EXPORD or OPORD describing exercise command and control. 
4.4.5.2.  When deployed in support of AMC AE operations, the ERPPS-10 and ERPSS-P, 
fall under the OPCON or TACON of the 618 AOC (TACC).   
4.4.6.  ERPSS-50 through ERPSS-100. 
4.4.6.1.  The ERPSS-50/ERPSS-100 UTCs will fall under TACON of the Air 
Expeditionary Wing (AEW)/Air Expeditionary Group (AEG) commander. 
4.4.6.2.  If there is no AF presence, the UTCs may align under TACON of the local MTF 
IAW the OPORD, which defines specific command relationships.  OPCON remains with 
the theater COMAFFOR.  These UTCs may be designated a squadron under the 
expeditionary or fixed MDG/CC. 
4.4.6.3.  If the UTCs are located on other than AF locations, the UTCs will be under the 
OPCON of the AEW MDG/CC and TACON of host base commander unless otherwise 
specified in the OPORD. 
4.4.6.4.  When deployed to a location with a peacetime ERPSS, the ERPSS-50/ERPSS-
100 UTCs may be merged with the peacetime assets and the commander will be 
identified prior to deployment from the senior administrator, flight surgeon, and nurse, 
with command and/or ERPSS-50/ERPSS-100 UTC experience.  If the assets are not 
merged, the UTCs may become a squadron and will report to the host AF medical facility 
commander.

Chapter 5 
INTELLIGENCE, NATIONAL AGENCY AND SPACE SUPPORT 
5.1.  Intelligence.  Accurate medical intelligence is critical to threat identification and 
application of appropriate preventive medicine measures.  Prior to deployment, units, groups, 
and/or individuals tasked to support an operation require deployment briefings IAW AFI 41-106, 
and AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning.  During the employment stage of an operation, ERPSS 
personnel require periodic briefings for their deployed location and for areas transited while 
conducting medical operations.  The AFFOR Surgeon is responsible to ensure periodic 
medical/environmental intelligence updates are provided to all assigned units.  Wing and Group 
commanders, in IAW with operational directives, coordinate communication of medical 
intelligence information with other base agencies. 
5.2.  National Agency.  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the National Center for 
Medical Intelligence (NCMI) https://www.intelink.gov/ncm, are primary sources for current 
medical intelligence prior to deployment.  In the deployed environment, the Aerospace 
Expeditionary Task Forces (ASETF)/AFFOR Surgeon is the primary source for dissemination of 
theater/regional medical intelligence. 
5.3.  Space Support.  Space-derived intelligence, weather updates, and troop movements are 
examples of valuable information that are primarily acquired through base support 
units/organizations.  Accurate medical intelligence is crucial to threat identification and 
application of appropriate preventive medicine measures.  The AFFOR Surgeon is responsible 
for ensuring assigned units receive periodic medical/environmental intelligence updates.  Space-
based communication systems, linked with terrestrial C2 systems, give the theater surgeon and 
deployed medical commander the ability to more effectively and efficiently direct, monitor, and 
employ the deployed medical forces and resources.

AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
Chapter 6 
COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SUPPORT 
6.1.  Communication Requirements.  The communication systems/equipment used must be 
interoperable to optimize joint communications and frequency management operations. 
Communication planners must coordinate frequency requirements through appropriate frequency 
management channels (e.g. installation, MAJCOM, and theater) to ensure all radiating 
equipment is spectrum certified and frequency supportable. 
6.1.1.  Host nation coordination must be initiated before a full-scale deployment.  ERPSS 
requires ECS for deployed NCC functionality, supplying networking core services (e.g. Wide 
Area Network (WAN) network access, information protection, Network Operating System 
(NOS) domain architecture, and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) 
addressing).  
6.2.  Air Force C4 Policy.  AFI 33-108, Compatibility, Interoperability, and Integration of 
Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems, establishes guidance and 
responsibilities to ensure compatibility, interoperability, and integration for new and modified 
C4 systems, including automated information systems (AIS). 
6.3.  Network Operations.  AFI 33-115, Air Force Information Technology (IT) Service 
Management, identifies the responsibilities for training, equipping, and supporting AF 
communications and information network users primarily through the use of Workgroup 
Managers (WM), NCC and MAJCOM Network Operations and Security Centers (NOSC).  AF 
network management adheres to the Defense Information Infrastructure Control Concept 
(DIICC) consisting of areas of distributed responsibility at global, regional, and local levels. 
6.4.  Information Assurance (IA) Policy.  The ERPSS personnel must understand and follow 
IA procedures, to include Communications Security (COMSEC) and computer security 
(COMPUSEC), IAW AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA) Management, and associated AF 
IA guidance.  Deploying ERPSS personnel must have current AF IA certification. 
6.5.  Communication Equipment.  The ERPSS deploys with organic computer hardware and 
software.  While the ERPSS-10 does contain some limited self-sustaining communications, 
longer-term and more robust systems support will be required from base and/or ECS 
communication resources. 
6.5.1.  Communication Personnel (FFQCR).  An FFQCR will be tasked in conjunction with 
the ERPSS-10 to provide initial communication personnel support, set-up and initiate 
communication between elements, process and track requests for AE, follow mission 
progress, and maintain situational awareness. 
6.5.2.  Satellite/Local Area Network (LAN) Connectivity.  Satellite Communication 
(SATCOM) assets deploy with the ERPSS packages.  Though satellite connectivity is the 
preferred connection, factors such as bandwidth availability and CCDR priorities may dictate 
other than SATCOM usage.  Theater Deployable Communications (TDC) provides other 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
43 
 
 
methods for theater communications.  Telemedicine, medical logistics support, video 
transmission, and electronic mail require SATCOM capability when there is no LAN/WAN 
connectivity or a TDC network available.  Satellite communications may be military or DOD 
approved commercial systems.  Secondary communications links, such as LAN are obtained 
upon arrival in theater (via ECS) depending on the maturity of the theater communications 
infrastructure and the availability of commercial or military service provided circuits. 
6.5.3.  Communication Systems. 
6.5.3.1.  Laptops.  The ERPSS deploys with standard laptops containing the DOD 
Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) and Theater Medical Information Program 
(TMIP)-AF software.  Both are capable of word processing, database management, store-
forward telemedicine, tele-maintenance, message text formatting, graphics, and 
LAN/WAN interface capability. 
6.5.3.2.  Radio Systems.  The AE system uses organic Very High Frequency (VHF) and 
SATCOM radio assets as a means of providing secure/non-secure communications 
capability.  Radio equipment will be the AF current model and type with appropriate 
encryption capability as supported by the CCDR.  This radio system is operationally 
focused to manage intra-ERPSS communications and support flight line PM operations.  
Communication requirements and frequency allocation issues need to be coordinated 
prior to deployment.  The radio equipment is interoperable with a wide variety of DOD 
and commercial radios.  Use of these radio sets in operations OCONUS, needs to be 
approved through the appropriate theater leadership. 
6.5.3.3.  Iridium Phones with secure sleeve.  Iridium phones are handheld satellite phones 
that work anywhere in the world.  It is larger than a typical mobile phone, but still small 
enough to carry in a backpack, is very simple to use, and provides secure/unsecure voice 
telephone capabilities through satellites.  For secure communications, a secure sleeve 
must be attached to the phone handset.  Each Unit will use their local Program Designator 
Code (PDC) for the purchase and activation of Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards 
for training and exercises. WRM SIM cards will not be used for unit training or exercises.  
When iridium phones are deployed, the WRM SIM card will be activated using the 
appropriate contingency operation consolidated PDC. 
6.5.3.4.  Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN).  Portable and easy to setup the 
BGAN is another satellite phone that uses satellites located around the earth for 
worldwide telephone capabilities.  This system can also interface with the Secure 
Terminal Equipment (STE) to provide secure communications.  Each Unit will use their 
local Program Designator Code (PDC) for the purchase and activation of SIM cards for 
training and exercises.  WRM SIM cards will not be used for unit training or exercises.  
When BGAN phones are deployed, the WRM SIM card will be activated using the 
appropriate contingency operation consolidated PDC.

6.5.3.4.1.  All applicable information for the Iridium and International 
Marine/Maritime Satellite/(INMARSAT) can be found at the activation website:  
https://www.disadirect.disa.mil/products/ASP/welcome.ASP 
6.6.  Medical Reports and Communication.  ERPSS UTCs are required to provide a daily 
SITREP and OPREP-3 when necessary.  All medical reports are submitted IAW AFI 10-206, 
Chapter 4, Operational Reporting, specific Joint Task Force (JTF), and COMAFFOR guidance.  
These reports are communicated to the AFFOR Surgeon, contributing MAJCOM Surgeons, and 
the AF Surgeon General.  See Attachment 11 for SITREP and OPREP-3 Formats. 
6.6.1.  SITREP.  SITREPs are completed by the deployed medical Team Chief (senior 
medical officer) to provide daily medical input for inclusion in the deployed wing’s SITREP.  
They are used to report the status of readiness of the element to the chain of command within 
the theater.  All AE elements will provide SITREPs to the Aeromedical Evacuation Command 
Cell (AECS) as directed, generally on a 24-hour basis, or when a major change in mission 
capability occurs.  The reports are normally submitted no later than 0200Z, reflecting data 
current as of 2359Z.  The AECS, then compiles the SITREPs and will provide daily status 
report on the operational status of the AE System and PM mission data to Higher 
Headquarters (HHQ) per AF directives. 
6.6.2.  OPREP-3.  AF OPREP-3s are used to immediately notify HHQ of any significant event 
or incident that rises to the level of DoD, CJCS, combatant command (CCMD), or Service 
Level interests.  The Command Post will submit the applicable AF OPREP-3 regardless of 
whether or not the event is being reported through other channels.  AF OPREP-3 reports do 
not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the Commander's SITREP.    
6.7.  Classification of Information.  Any classified information must be transmitted by secure 
means:  i.e. SITREPs, site locations, and flight information.  
 6.7.1.  Physical Security.  Protect classified equipment and documents against compromise or 
loss by using proper accounting and storage procedures.  Classified information that is not 
under the personal control and observation of an authorized person is to be guarded or stored 
in a General Services Administration (GSA) approved field safe.  One or two-drawer light 
containers must be securely fastened to the structure or under constant surveillance to prevent 
theft.  If the need arises for equipment/COMSEC destruction, see Attachment 15, Radio 
Equipment Destruction. 
6.7.2.  COMSEC Re-supply.  The AE Communications Team will deploy with the current 
months COMSEC material plus 90 day supply.  The AE Communications Team will have to 
establish a COMSEC account within the AOR if the operation will require secure 
communications beyond 90 days. 
6.8.  Message Precedence.  General Messages are all other message traffic with the precedence 
being designated by the message originator.  All message traffic transmitted via High Frequency 
(HF) communications is normally assigned precedence.  It serves as a guide to communication 
personnel to indicate the order of handling and notifies the addressee of the significance or

urgency of the content of the message.  All messages are sent as soon as possible; however, the 
one with the higher precedence is sent first. 
6.8.1.  FLASH.  This precedence is reserved for alerts, warnings, and other emergency actions 
having immediate bearing on national, command, or area security.  FLASH messages are 
hand carried, processed, transmitted, and delivered immediately ahead of all other messages. 
6.8.2.  Immediate.  This precedence is reserved for vital communication having immediate 
operational effect on tactical operations; communications directly concerning safety or rescue 
operations; and communications affecting the intelligence community operational role. 
6.8.3.  Priority.  This precedence is reserved for calls that require prompt completion for 
national defense and security, the successful conduct of war, or to safeguard life or property.  
Normally, priority is the highest precedence that may be assigned to administrative matters for 
which speed of handling is of vital importance.  Maximum delivery time is 24 hours. 
6.8.4.  Routine.  This precedence is reserved for all official communications to which all of 
the above listed precedence does not apply.  Routine messages are handled in the order 
received and after all messages of a higher precedence have been sent.  Maximum delivery 
time is 72 hours.

Chapter 7 
LINE INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY 
7.1.  Integration and Interoperability With Other Systems.  Integration and interoperability 
of deployed assets in an AOR are critical for successful medical operations.  Potential ERPSS 
deployments include the full spectrum of deployed scenarios.  This requires that medical 
integration and interoperability occur with line elements of an AEF, components of the ERCC, 
joint medical counterparts, Special Operations Forces (SOF), SOF medical components, and 
other federal and civilian support systems.  In some instances, theater planners may request an 
ERPSS to support Army or SOF bed down locations not associated with typical AEF or ECS 
infrastructure.  Coordinating logistics, integrating with other organic medical assets, and 
understanding/clarifying command and control are essential to support a seamless casualty care 
continuum. 
7.2.  ECS Requirements.  Integration with the line counterparts is particularly critical for ECS 
and PM.  ECS requirements include, but are not limited to, messing and other consumable 
materials, water, ice, fuels, billeting, latrines, showers, laundry, mortuary affairs, public affairs, 
chaplain, linguist, waste management, transportation (to include ambulance-type vehicles), 
vehicle maintenance support, vehicle decontamination, equipment maintenance, general supplies, 
contracting, information and communications systems support and maintenance, personnel 
decontamination and security.  This is applicable to ERPSS support for the entire spectrum of 
AEF operations.

Chapter 8 
SECURITY AND FORCE PROTECTION 
8.1.  Security.  Medical personnel and equipment are non-combatant assets as defined by 
Geneva Conventions and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  Medical personnel are authorized 
arms IAW AFI 31-117.  Security within the immediate area for patients and personnel resources 
at each deployed medical site is a medical responsibility. 
8.2.  Operations.  In most deployment scenarios the ERPSS deploys to secure locations.  The 
DFC has overall responsibility for security operations, including physical security, and force 
protection issues.  Current threat assessments provided by the combatant commander and local 
threat conditions established by the AEW commander (or equivalent) dictate all local security 
measures.  ERPSS personnel are required to provide site security within the immediate area of 
their facilities.  Protection of ERPSS patients and personnel is the responsibility of the ERPSS 
Team Chief. 
8.3.  Physical Security.  Medical assets (personnel and WRM assemblages) are protected in 
accordance with AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.  ERPSS personnel are responsible for 
following all personal protective measures as outlined in AFI 31-101, AOR security briefings, 
established force protection requirements, and other guidance.  The DFC and security forces 
provide technical advice and recommendations on physical plant protection issues for the 
ERPSS.  The ERPSS medical control center must maintain direct radio contact with the 
AEW/AEG Expeditionary Operations Center (EOC) and the Base Defense Operations Center 
(BDOC). 
8.3.1.  The ERPSS Team Chief is responsible for ensuring force protection measures are taken 
to protect his/her unit and the Team Chief may request support personnel from security forces, 
depending upon threat and AOR requirements.  The DFC will provide security for ERPSS 
only if he/she deems it necessary as part of the overall base defense plan.  The security at 
deployed locations is specifically sized.  If the threat changes, the DFC may appoint an 
augmented security detail to provide the ERPSS with the required personnel for force 
protection, entry control points and sentries. 
8.4.  OPSEC.  OPSEC requirements will be adhered to IAW AFI 10-701, Operations Security.  
To prevent an adversary from gaining a military advantage, ERPSS staff must control mission 
critical information from inadvertent disclosure.  
8.5.  COMPUSEC.  COMPUSEC requirements will be adhered to IAW AFI 33-201V2, 
Communication Security (COMSEC) User Requirements, and AFI 33-332, The Air Force 
Privacy and Civil Liberties Program.  ERPSS staff will protect systems against sabotage, 
tampering, denial of service, espionage, fraud, misappropriation, misuse, or release to 
unauthorized persons.  
8.6.  Security of Weapons and Ammunition.  All members shall comply with AFI 31-207, and 
local procedures when securing weapons and ammunition.  To minimize the threat to patients 
and staff, a weapons clearing barrel should be placed outside the main entrance to the ERPSS 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
49 
 
 
when threats require personnel to carry loaded weapons.  Personnel, other than Security Forces 
responding to a request for assistance, should not be allowed to enter the ERPSS with a loaded 
weapon.  
8.6.1.  Staff Weapons.  ERPSS personnel may be issued weapons/ammunition and authorized 
by the ERPSS facility commander at the direction of the AEW/AEG commander (or 
equivalent) and IAW the Law of Armed Conflict and the Geneva Conventions to carry these 
weapons during the performance of their duties.  Weapons and ammunition need to be 
secured. 
8.6.2.  Patient Weapons.  Normally, patient weapons/ammunition arriving at the ERPSS 
facility will be transferred immediately to a member of the patient’s unit.  When not possible, 
the ERPSS may temporarily store the weapons until the patient’s unit or AEW/AEG armory 
can accept responsibility.  Properly clear all weapons before securing them.

Chapter 9 
ERPSS TRAINING 
9.1.  Education Programs.  Education programs improve Airman’s skills and knowledge across 
the full range of military operations.  Unit training requirements will be maintained IAW  
AFI 41-106.  The staging mission is a unique role integral to the successful movement of 
patients.  Corporate knowledge and expertise of PM issues are the responsibility of the team 
leader.  Smaller personnel packages supporting expeditionary operations will require personnel 
to perform a variety of functions (multi-tasking), which may not be in their specific AFSC 
responsibilities (i.e. Readiness Skill Verifications [RSVs] or Career Field Education and 
Training Plans (CFETP)).  Accordingly, training shall emphasize a breadth of talents and skills. 
9.2.  Training Environment.  Training should be conducted in an environment that permits 
assigned personnel to exercise with the actual equipment and supplies of the ERPSS UTCs.  
Educating and training as a UTC permits personnel to learn and support the duties of other team 
members.  Some sustainment training and RSVs may be completed at operational exercises, 
provided the exercise meets the criteria.  Readiness training will be conducted in conjunction 
with sponsored or local training exercises, or in conjunction with operational deployments.  
9.3.  Cross-Functionality.  Training to enhance multi/cross-functionality between AFSCs is 
encouraged as it provides maximum capability and ensures all assigned personnel can function 
throughout the ERPSS, regardless of AFSC.  Joint training is encouraged to foster relationships 
and enhance capabilities of each service.  When the opportunity exists, it is highly beneficial for 
all units to coordinate with co-located AE Squadrons to accomplish ERPSS UTC training.  This 
cooperative training will serve to enhance team members overall ERCC knowledge, enhance 
tasking and patient reporting skills, and will provide an opportunity for the AELT/AE 
Communications Team and AEOT members to train with the ERPSS UTCs.  Familiarity with 
CCATT and AE operations is also essential. 
9.4.  Home Station Training Responsibility.  At home station, the MDG/CC is responsible to 
ensure appropriate time is allowed to conduct and complete specific UTC training and that it is 
properly documented (maintained within the unit Medical Readiness Office).  Personnel assigned 
to the ERPSS should be fully trained and ready to deploy prior to entering their deployment 
“band” or continuously ready for those assigned as an “enabler.”  ERPSS personnel should also 
be aware that they may be performing strenuous work in an austere environment, so maintaining 
physical fitness is a necessity.  The Medical Readiness Officer (MRO) is responsible for 
reporting the training statistics to their parent MAJCOM using the MAJCOM prescribed format. 
9.5.  Training Categories.  Medical Readiness training is grouped as Category I, II or III.  
Medical personnel must complete all required Category I and II training upon initial assignment 
to a UTC, before entering their deployment vulnerability period and ensure completed training 
remains current for the duration of the vulnerability period or associated deployment.  UTC team 
integrity should be maintained to the maximum extent possible during all training forums, that is, 
medics who deploy together will have trained together prior to deploying. 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
51 
 
 
9.5.1.  Category I.  Individual training is required for all medical personnel, and in some cases 
assigned non-medical personnel, civilians, and contractors, regardless of their deployment 
status. 
9.5.1.1.  Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP).  Training must be completed 
prior to deployment.  Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the specialty 
consultant or Career Field Manager.  RSVP checklists can be accessed on the Air Force 
Medical Service Knowledge Exchange (AFMS Kx) at: https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx9/RSVP 
9.5.1.2.  Personnel must complete RSVP training for their Career Air Force Specialty 
Code (CAFSC) for enlisted and Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) for officers.  
9.5.1.3.  Personnel who are utilized as authorized substitutes on a standard UTC must 
complete RSVP training for the AFSC they are filling on the UTC, as well as their own.  
Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the specialty consultants or Career Field 
Managers (CFM) of both AFSCs. 
9.5.2.  Category II:  Training required for medical personnel assigned to standard deployable 
UTCs. 
9.5.2.1.  Initial Formal Training.  UTC formal training is to be accomplished in 
accordance with AFI 41-106, unless otherwise directed by the MRA or higher authority.  
Personnel assigned to the ERPSS UTCs:  FFEPS, FFPPS, FFFPS, and FFHPS will 
complete the Aeromedical Evacuation and Patient Staging (AEPS) formal course at 
Camp Bullis, TX and complete the Aeromedical Evacuation and Patient Staging (AEPS) 
Computer Based Training (CBT), located on MedLearn, through the ADLS Gateway 
within 12 months of assignment.  These courses are designed to ensure ERPSS personnel 
are proficient in the ERPSS UTC Mission Essential Tasks (METs).  Once initial training 
is complete, ERPSS personnel will remain on that UTC for a minimum of 24 months or 
until they permanently change stations (PCS).  The unit commander may waive the 24-
month assignment requirement.  The waiver will identify why the individual was 
removed from the position and when the 24-month period is completed.  The waiver will 
be maintained in the MRO until the end of the 24-month period.  This requirement for a 
24-month UTC waiver is not applicable to the ARC.  ARC sustainment training 
requirements are every 48 months. 
9.5.2.1.1.  Recurring Formal/Sustainment Training.  FFEPS and FFPPS personnel 
will attend sustainment training every 24 months and personnel assigned to all other 
ERPSS UTCs (FFFPS/FFHPS) will, after initial training, attend sustainment training 
every 48 months.  This will occur by either participation in MET-driven exercises, 
local exercises, and joint exercises approved by a Readiness Training Oversight 
Committee (RTOC) or MRA (HQ AMC/SG), or they will go back to the formal 
AEPS course.  Contact the HQ AMC/SGX MEFPAK branch for information on 
MRA approved sustainment training exercises.  Personnel assigned to fixed ERPSS 
facilities will complete AEPS course one time, within 12 months of assignment, 
52 
 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
unless assigned to an ERPSS UTC that requires sustainment training as described 
above. 
9.5.2.2.  Miscellaneous/Mandatory Deployment Training. 
9.5.2.2.1.  Passport.  All members, upon assignment to the ERPSS-10/ERPSS-P 
enabler teams, will obtain official military passports.  The US State Department no 
longer provides “blanket” approval waivers for official passports, thus team members 
will need to identify one of the following countries, all of which require official 
passports, with an estimated deployment date six months from the date of assignment 
to the Enabler UTC: Azerbaijan, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, 
Jordan, Iraq, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Thailand, Honduras, Mali or Oman. Members 
assigned to Enabler teams are required to have official passports prior to 
employment/deployment.       
9.5.2.2.2.  Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) Access/Account.  The 
ERPSS team chief will identify the team members who will be required to establish 
current SIPRNET accounts and receive required training through their MRO per 
AMCI 10-403, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Force Deployment. 
9.5.3. Category III.  This training consists of unit level training. 
9.5.3.1.  Sustainment Training.  ERPSS personnel training will cover the entire spectrum 
of deployed PM operations and all phases of deployment, employment, and 
redeployment.  Specific ERPSS training will be incorporated into regular UTC 
sustainment training at the unit level. 
9.5.3.2.  Required Quarterly/Annual Training Topics.  Quarterly training of ERPSS 
operations is required to include training identified below.  The team chief will develop 
an annual, team specific training agenda to ensure team members are fully trained.  
Participation in a MAJCOM approved exercise can be utilized to meet this quarterly 
training requirement.  
Units with ERPSS personnel and equipment UTCs will ensure an operational test of the 
associated equipment allowance standards are completed annually (e.g. pack equipment 
into High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles( HMMWVs), drive HMMWVs to 
on-base location, unpack/set-up/test all equipment, tear-down/repack equipment into 
HMMWVs, inventory IAW AFI 41-201, and return allowance standards to storage. 
9.5.3.2.1.  Pallet Build-up. 
9.5.3.2.2.  Hazardous Material/ Hazardous Materials Declaration 
(HAZMAT/HAZDEC).  Each unit should have a currently certified hazardous cargo 
courier trained to deploy with each ERPSS increment. 
9.5.3.2.3.  Vehicles.  All personnel assigned to an ERPSS are required to have a 
government driver’s license with Ambulance Bus (AMBUS), HMMWV, and truck 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
53 
 
 
cargo 5-ton capability.  Note:  For bases that do not have an AMBUS, training on the 
44-PAX vehicle will meet this requirement as this vehicle can provide the same 
familiarization with regard to handling, minus the seating configuration.  For the 
ERPSS-P, ERPSS-50 and ERPSS-100 UTCs, any AF medic with their own 
government issued driver’s license, officer or enlisted, can train for licensure.  Each 
ERPSS module will contain multiple qualified drivers to provide 24/7 coverage at the 
deployed location. 
9.5.3.2.4.  Required training areas: The ERPSS Team Chief will designate team 
members to be trained annually in the following areas: 
9.5.3.2.4.1.  Forklift operation. 
9.5.3.2.4.2.  Generators identified on the ERPSS Allowance Standards. 
9.5.3.2.4.3.  Providing Oxygen Support.  
9.5.3.2.4.4.  Vehicle Pack-out. 
9.5.3.2.4.5.  Communication Equipment Operation (overview/awareness). 
9.5.3.2.4.6.  Map/Compass/GPS training. 
9.5.3.2.4.7.  Heaters identified on the ERPSS Allowance Standards.  
9.5.3.2.4.8.  Tent Erection and Site Camouflage. 
9.5.3.2.4.9.  Security and terrorism response training. 
9.5.3.2.5.  Weapons Training.  All medical personnel are required to receive weapons 
training.  Weapons qualification and currency will be annotated on AF Form 522, 
USAF Firearms Qualification.  Category B personnel are those who would not 
ordinarily be issued a weapon in peacetime operations, but may be issued a weapon 
for designated hostile areas.  All assigned FFEPS team members are required to be 
dual qualified in both M-16/M-4 and M-9.  Those personnel assigned to the UTC 
FFEPS/FFPPS as “enablers”, are required to be current at all times.  
9.5.3.2.5.1.  Weapons training requirements are outlined in AFI 31-117 and AFI 
41-106.  The theater Combatant Commander may levy additional requirements, 
which are generally specified in the operation’s Execution Order (EXORD) or 
reporting instructions.  See the Weapons and Munitions Forecasting Table for 
AFMS UTCs on the AFMS Medical Readiness site for more information.  
Therefore, maximum weapons training for personnel assigned to standard UTCs 
is highly encouraged. 
9.5.3.2.5.2.  At least two personnel assigned to each ERPSS UTC are needed to 
qualify as a weapons courier for each ERPSS UTC.  Units will coordinate with 
54 
 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
their local Combat Arms personnel for additional weapons qualifications 
requirements for personnel on alternate deployment UTC positions.  Failure to 
qualify does not automatically remove an individual from deployment status.  All 
medical personnel who qualify may be issued a weapon. 
9.5.3.3.  Specialized Training.  Personnel may be identified to accomplish the following 
training as applicable; Advanced Trauma/Critical Care Clinical, TRANSCOM Regulating 
and Command & Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES), Theater Medical Information 
Program (TMIP), Aeromedical Evacuation Electronic Health Record (EHR), and/or 
Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application – Theater (AHLTA-T).

Chapter 10 
LOGISTICS 
10.1.  Medical Re-Supply.  The ERPSS-10 deploys with an initial seven day supply and the 
ERPSS-50 and ERPSS-100 a 30-day supply of expendable items.  Expeditionary Medical 
Logistics provides timely re-supply of ordered items to deployed medical units.  Upon 
deployment notification, medical logistics personnel should contact the Air Force Medical 
Logistics Operations Center (AFMLOC) to receive re-supply guidance for specific 
destination/location at DSN (312) 343-4172/2883/4294.  The Air Force expeditionary medical 
logistics reachback program provides timely, single point re-supply of ordered medical items to 
initally deployed medical unit until the Theater Lead Medical Materiel (TLAMM) is operational.  
Interim to TLAMM support,  deployed units will place orders through the Operations Group to 
AFMOA/SGALW at Port San Antonio, Texas.  AFMOA/SGALW receives orders from 
deployed units and takes necessary actions to ensure 100% of all orders are transmitted to 
vendors/depots, are immediately purchased, packed, marked, and shipped so that the materiel is 
received by the deployed unit.  Once the theater has sustained operations, the TLAMM system 
will become the source for all joint medical supply needs.  Fixed ERPSS’s will be supported by 
the base MTF Medical Logisitics Account.  For further guidance, refer to AFTTP 3-42.8, 
Expeditionary Medical Logistics (EML) System.  
10.1.1.  Re-supply UTCs.  The ERPSS has two re-supply UTCs (a) FFPS8, AS 904K, which 
provides 15 day re-supply to the ERPSS-10 and (b) FFPS3, AS 904H, which can be used to 
re-supply the ERPSS-50.  Additional FFPS3 UTCs can be tasked to provide re-supply for 
ERPSS 100 and 200 bed facilities. 
10.2.  Medical Equipment. 
10.2.1.  Maintenance/Repair.  A Biomedical Equipment Technician does not become a part of 
the ERPSS until the  50-bed stage.  Medical Equipment Maintenance or Repair may be 
coordinated with the EMEDS/AFTH/host MTF.  
10.2.2.  Patient Movement Items.  HQ AMC/SG is the MRA for the Global PMI Program. 
AMC/SG will provide funding, management direction and oversight in support of PMI 
Centers, PMI operational support and training platforms, and will develop and maintain the 
PMI CONOPS.  All Medical personnel must be familiar with the many aspects of the theater’s 
PMI program, to include obtaining, storing, maintenance, tracking, and recycling practices of 
the PMI commodity.  The PMI Tracking System (PMITS) is the Joint tool for asset visibility 
and essential for timely AE equipment recycle support to prevent degradation of forward 
element medical capability.  Personnel must work with the AE community in tracking assets 
for optimal utilization.  Guidance for PMI is located in AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics 
Support. 
10.2.2.1.  All personnel working in PMI Centers, theater PMI Cell, and AE units will 
scan all PMI equipment in their area of responsibility as READY/OUT/QA as applicable.  
PMI Equipment must be scanned each time it moves or changes category. 
56 
 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
 
10.2.2.2.  Personnel with questions regarding the PMI program should contact HQ 
AMC/SGXM at 1-877-286-1931 / DSN: (312) 779-6952 or email hqamcpmi@us.af.mil. 
10.3.  ECS Supported Capabilities (see Attachment 5).  Support services such as billeting, 
food service, sewage and waste disposal, potable water, power, transportation and vehicle 
maintenance will be provided by ECS to support the ERPSS needs. 
10.3.1.  Non-Medical Equipment Maintenance.  Base Civil Engineering (CE) is responsible 
for major maintenance of equipment (e.g., generators and Heating, Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC) systems).  Support will be provided using Basic Expeditionary Airfield 
Resources (BEAR) assets or similar components. 
10.3.2.  Electrical Power.  Deployed base electrical power systems provide prime and backup 
power for the ERPSS facilities and equipment.  Initial support will be provided using power 
generators.  High voltage primary power will be provided once installed, and the tactical 
generators allocated for emergency backup power.  Ground power equipment specialists will 
be provided to connect Power Distribution Panels (PDPs) to commercial or bare base power. 
10.3.3.  Fuel.  Ground fuels support will normally be obtained on a contract basis.  Fuels for 
the ERPSS vehicles, generators, etc., will be included with other base requirements. 
10.3.4.  Medical Gases/Oxygen.  Refill of oxygen storage systems will be part of ECS 
requirements.  This can also be accomplished by utilizing the EMEDS, Expeditionary 
Deployable Oxygen Containment System (EDOCS), Mobile Oxygen Storage Tank (MOST), 
or the deployable oxygen package (FF0X2).  For staging facilities that are over 100 beds, 
recommend adding a dedicated FF0X2 for additional oxygen refill capability. 
10.3.5.  Potable Water.  Potable water must be readily available either as a secure piped 
supply, water buffalo, or bladder.  Since the ERPSS does not have its own Bioenvironmental 
Engineer, water testing and guarantee of a constant uncontaminated supply of water needs to 
be assured by the host facility IAW AF standards for initial and ongoing water 
testing/verification. 
10.3.6.  Sanitary Sewer.  Sewer and toilet facilities need to be provided either as part of a 
building of opportunity, or as serviced port-a-potties for patients; control is essential. 
10.3.7.  Communications Infrastructure.  Communications with the host facility and PMRCs 
are crucial.  Radio or land-line (such as telephone or field phone) may be used, but is required 
to be reliable and secure as the CCDR mandates. 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
57 
 
 
10.4.  Facility Requirements. 
10.4.1.  Physical Location.  The location of an ERPSS should be on or very near the flightline, 
especially in a contingency.  If located adjacent to the flightline, planners have to take prop 
wash into consideration.  Operational requirements for airfield storage, command space, 
maintenance, supply, etc. might force the location of an ERPSS away from the airstrip; 
however, the distance from the flight line will directly and proportionally affect requirements 
for personnel, vehicles, and time required for planning and processing missions.  Ideally, 
location for the ERPSS should be 200-500 feet from aircraft parking.  A distance of more than 
one mile will adversely affect the ability of the ERPSS to complete its mission. 
10.4.2.  Flightline Access.  The ERPSS requires clear access to the flight line, unencumbered 
by natural barriers or excessive unfinished roadways.  If not bordering the aircraft parking 
ramp, the road access to the ERPSS needs to be flat and either gravel or hard-surfaced since 
the AMBUS can operate only on level flat surfaces and does not have 4-wheel drive 
capability.  Heavy rain or snow could potentially shut down an ERPSS not appropriately 
serviced with an all-weather road. 
10.4.3.  Building of Opportunity Requirements.  In cases where there is availability of an 
appropriate building(s) of opportunity, there are minimum standards and requirements that 
must be met for safe conduct of ERPSS operations. 
10.4.3.1.  Decontamination of Site/Building of Opportunity/Vehicles.  Support may be 
provided using BEAR, Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) or 
commercial assets.  In contaminated environments, base support may be required for 
decontamination of deployed medical facility infrastructure and vehicles to include 
decontamination of the site location when necessary. 
10.4.4.  Size.  The ERPSS facility requires floor space as given in Figure 10.1.  It may be 
partitioned or open as in a hangar or gymnasium.  Larger ERPSS’s will require buildings of 
proportionately more floor space as calculated by the number and type of additional UTCs 
deployed.  The ERPSS-10 utilizes the Utilis Tent System®.  Tentage requirements for the 
ERPSS-50 to 200 use an Alaska Small Shelter System® (32 feet long x 20 feet wide).  If other 
type of tents, such as temper tents, are substituted, similar floor space needs be provided.  
Modular facilities or other buildings of opportunity should be of equivalent size.

10.4.5.  Tent Requirements.  If an appropriate building is not available, tentage must be used.  
If tents are required, there are minimum requirements for their location and set up.  Location 
selected should be level, unobstructed and of sufficient elevation to prevent flooding.  To 
allow for incremental building of the ERPSS UTC’s correct initial placement of the ERPSS is 
critical.  Adequate space on both ends of the ERPSS should be available to allow for the 
addition of more tents if the ERPSS is required to incrementally increase in size.  Due to the 
length of the electrical cables in the ERPSS AS, the following items are required to be 
considered for initial placement of the ERPSS-10.  When increasing an ERPSS-50 to an 
ERPSS-100, the additional tents should be attached to the generator end of the facility.  When 
placing the ERPSS adjacent to a flight line or roadway the entrance doors of the ERPSS 
should face the direction the patients will be transported to or from the facility.   
10.4.6.  Fire Safety.  Approval of the shelter by the local fire chief authority should be 
accomplished prior to patient use.  Adequate exits, alarms, smoke detectors, and fire 
extinguishers are critical.  Briefings regarding use and planned evacuation routes will be 
routinely provided to patients and staff. 
10.4.7.  Evacuation.  Secondary and tertiary locations for evacuating are required to be 
coordinated in advance.  These locations are required to be communicated to all members and 
emergency response organizations.  The facility manager is responsible for maintaining and 
updating evacuation plans. 
10.4.8.  Utilities.  Electricity and lighting are essential and are required to be 110-120 Volts, 
50-60Hz, with adequate outlets for servicing electronic patient equipment.  At least 12 outlets 
for each 25 beds is a minimum.  Batteries for AE missions may be charged during patient 
holding time in the ERPSS.  Lighting is required to be adequate to assure safe movement of 
patients and personnel in the facility. 
10.4.9.  Drainage.  The facilities should be on slightly crowned ground to facilitate drainage.  
A ramp to the buildings is acceptable.  Steps into the buildings are hazardous.  A second floor 
location is an unacceptable location. 
AFTTP3-42.57  10 AUGUST 2016 
 
59 
 
 
10.4.10.  Contamination/Exposure.  The facility must be free of toxic contamination from 
previous use.  Consideration should be given to carbon monoxide exposure from engines 
running near the facility.  Proximity to fuel and petroleum products should be avoided since 
patient movement is difficult during a flight line emergency or fire. 
10.4.11.  Thermal.  Safe heating/cooling is required to maintain the facility temperature within 
a temperature range, between 68-80 degrees F (approximate range). 
10.4.12.  Security and Safety.  Security and safety should be the highest priority when 
identifying a location.  Hardening of the facility can be accomplished if necessary.  Windows, 
glass, high-unsupported ceilings, and wood construction are a liability.  
10.4.13.  Roof.  The roof must be waterproof, the floor hardened and without risk of flooding.  
If tentage is used, a rain fly is required to be affixed. 
10.4.14.  Hardening/Force Protection.  Based on the situational environment, hardening 
should be considered for any ERPSS structure.

RADIO EQUIPMENT DESTRUCTION 
1.1.  Types of Destruction.  The ranking official on site will determine whether the nature and 
circumstances involved in the threat to the material requires precautionary destruction or total 
destruction.  
1.1.1.  Precautionary Destruction.  Precautionary destruction would include the destruction of 
administrative documents, files and other material not required for continued operation.  
Under no circumstances will equipment be destroyed under the precautionary destruction 
order.  Insure that records indicate what material has been destroyed when precautionary 
destruction is implemented.  Retain all equipment, all operational and maintenance 
documents, and a 90-day supply of COMSEC material. 
1.1.2.  Total Destruction.  Total destruction includes the destruction of key tapes, documents, 
and equipment.  This plan is implemented when the commander decides forces and facilities 
are no longer adequate to protect classified and COMSEC material from impending capture or 
loss.  Normally, other individuals are empowered to put the plan into effect on their own if 
conditions prevent contact with the commander.  The person most familiar with the amount 
and significance of COMSEC material on-hand must prepare a clear and concise plan.  
Planners should consider the options available when preparing for hostile actions.  Where and 
when capture or overrun could be imminent; the plan should always be directed toward using 
the most expeditious means consistent with insuring total destruction. 
1.2.  Precedence of Destruction.  Destroy assets in the following descending order: 
1.2.1.  TOP SECRET-CRYPTO and TOP SECRET simultaneously. 
1.2.2.  SECRET-CRYPTO. 
1.2.3.  SECRET. 
1.2.4.  CRYPTO CONTROLLED ITEMS (CCI). 
1.2.5.  Remaining classified material and equipment that could benefit the enemy. 
1.3.  Zeroing.  The term "zeroized" is used to describe the action taken to remove stored 
information from the memory of electronic equipment.  The Secure Terminal Equipment (STE), 
Iridium sleeve and loaded PSC-5 and PRC-150 must be erased in order to ensure complete 
destruction.  (Consult equipment-operating instructions for zeroizing procedures.) 
1.4.  Methods of Destruction.  There are three basic methods of destruction: 
1.4.1.  Burning.  If using thermite or sodium nitrate on equipment, use proper safety 
procedures.  Make sure the burn is complete and paper or plastic products are completely 
destroyed.

1.4.2.  Smashing.  Completely destroy integral components to render the equipment 
inoperable and beyond repair. 
1.4.3.  Shredding.  Always use COMSEC approved cross cutting shredders to prevent 
reconstruction of documents.
