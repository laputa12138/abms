Chapter 1 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Overview.  As part of the Air Force Special Warfare mission to provide precision strike 
across the spectrum of conflict, the Air Force trains JTACs to support combatant command 
requirements. Per joint doctrine for CAS; a JTAC is a certified and qualified service member who, 
from a forward position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in CAS and other offensive 
air operations. A qualified JTAC is recognized across the Department of Defense (DoD) as capable 
and authorized to perform TAC (reference Joint Publication (JP) 3-09.3, Close Air Support). 
1.2.  Purpose.  The purpose of this manual is to ensure standardized JTAC training across the Air 
Force. Additionally, this document defines the individuals in the Air Force authorized for JTAC 
duties and establishes the Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) 1Z3X1 and TACP Officer 19ZXB 
Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) as JTAC-inherent. Adherence to this AFMAN ensures that 
Air Force JTACs meet all the requirements outlined in the JTAC MOA and JP 3-09, Joint Fire 
Support. Air Force JTACs are recognized across the DoD and by JTAC MOA partner nations as 
capable and authorized to perform TAC. 
1.2.1.  This manual provides baseline guidance for conducting a JTAC ICT program. Air Force 
unit JTAC training programs are governed by this AFMAN. Each unit with a JTAC program 
will have a Master Training Plan. (T-1) 
1.2.2.  Training programs should be tailored to meet the unit’s Mission Essential Tasks Lists 
(METLs). In addition, units should style training programs towards preparation for upcoming 
taskings or requirements IAW the unit’s Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or Mission 
Essential Tasks. 
1.2.3.  This manual provides guidance on the use of Ready Tasking Messages (RTMs). The 
RTM is a major command (MAJCOM)-developed continuation training (CT) program to 
improve proficiency of Air Force JTACs and to develop metrics that match resources with 
required JTAC training requirements. 
1.3.  Key Terms and Definitions. 
1.3.1.  Certified JTAC:  A JTAC who has graduated a formal JTAC schoolhouse and 
completed ICT with no deficiencies. 
1.3.2.  Qualified JTAC:  An ICT complete JTAC who has completed mission qualification 
training (MQT) and passed a JTAC evaluation. 
1.3.3.  Current JTAC:  A qualified JTAC who has no CT deficiencies. 
1.3.4.  Non-Current JTAC:  A qualified JTAC who has one or more CT deficiencies. 
1.3.5.  Group:  Throughout this document, when referring to a “group”, the standard group is 
an Air Support Operations Group (ASOG) or a Special Tactics Group. ANG units may not 
always fall under a standard group. 
1.3.6.  Wing:  Throughout this document when referring to a “wing”, the standard wing is an 
Air Ground Operations Wing or Special Operations Wing. ANG units may not always fall 
under a standard wing.

AFMAN10-3505V1  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
13 
3.3.1.1.1.  When non-current on a specific control item. (T-1) For example: if a JTAC 
is non-current for night missions, they can still control day missions unsupervised. 
However, if they need to control a night mission, they need to be supervised by a JTAC 
who is “green” for night missions. (T-1) 
3.3.1.1.2.  When non-current in any category for greater than six months, but less than 
24 months, all controls must be supervised by a qualified JTAC. (T-1) 
3.3.1.2.  Supervision by a JTAC-I is required:

requalification, when instructing JTAC trainees, or when overseeing unqualified (24 
months or greater) JTACs in live TAC. (T-1)  
3.3.2.  A JTAC-I shall only instruct certification or qualification controls for which they are 
current and qualified (e.g., if qualified on day controls, but unqualified on night controls, the 
JTAC-I shall only instruct day controls). (T-1) 
3.3.3.  JTACs and collocated personnel will adhere to local published range safety procedures 
when conducting live TACs at air-to-ground range facilities. (T-1) In the event no local 
procedures are published, JTACs will utilize, at a minimum, personal protective equipment 
consisting of a helmet, body armor with plates inserted, and any additional items determined 
by the range safety officer or senior ranking member. (T-1) All personnel will wear laser eye 
protection IAW AFMAN 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, during laser

Flying or Special Operational Duty, and recommends duties not including controlling (DNIC) 
status, unit commanders will use their discretion on what duties (e.g., simulators, academic 
instruction) the individuals can perform that do not include control of live aircraft and/or 
munitions. (T-1) Unit commanders accept any risk taken by disregarding medical 
recommendations. 
14 
AFMAN10-3505V1  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
3.4.2.1.  After consultation with the flight surgeon and the unit JTAC-PM, unit 
commanders may authorize JTACs to continue performing specified JTAC training after 
assessing the risk. Note: Risk assessment decisions should consider the quality of training 
or instruction to be provided or received by the DNIC member for the duties being 
authorized. 
3.4.2.2.  The unit JTAC-PM will document the acceptance of risk and any exceptions to 
DNIC status on an AF Form 623A or a memorandum for record (MFR) (placed in Part IV

level of competence in JTAC requirements and in a unit’s primary tasked missions. It should be 
focused and tailored to the unit METL. MQT training requirements are documented on AF Form 
797. An example JTAC MQT program is provided in Attachment 5. Individuals must be ICT 
complete to begin MQT. 
4.5.1.  Unit JTAC-PMs will ensure that ICT complete individuals (marked “Certified” on their 
AF Form 1036) are entered into MQT no later than 30 days (training days for ANG) after 
arrival at their first duty station. (T-3) 
4.5.1.1.  For individuals who are not ICT complete (not marked “Certified” on their AF 
Form 1036), unit JTAC-PMs will ensure that all deficiencies are completed no later than 
60 days (training days for ANG) after arrival at their duty station. (T-3) 
4.5.1.2.  Once all deficiencies are completed, the JTAC-PM will contact the course 
manager for release of the JTAC Qualification Course certificate, mark the individuals AF 
Form 1036 as “Certified”, and the individual can begin MQT. (T-3) 
4.5.1.3.  The JTAC-PM will document individuals who fail to successfully complete ICT 
training deficiencies within 60 days (training days for ANG) and will annotate them as an 
ICT failure on a MFR signed by the unit commander and placed in their JTAC training and 
evaluation Folder. (T-3) A single extension of up to 30 days (training days for ANG) may 
be requested from the JTAC schoolhouse the individual attended. Individuals who fail to 
successfully complete their ICT training deficiencies will be treated IAW paragraph 4.4.4 
of this publication for non-progression. (T-3)

maintained by the assigned unit in either an analog or a digital format. (T-1) The JTAC training 
and evaluation folder will be used to record and maintain appropriate JTAC training and evaluation 
records during each duty assignment and deployment. (T-1) The JTAC training and evaluation 
folder or an up-to-date copy will accompany the individual JTAC to each duty assignment and 
deployment location to provide commanders a historical record of the individual’s JTAC 
certification and qualification training and their qualification status. (T-1) A JTAC training and 
evaluation folder is mandatory for all JTACs and will contain the six-part format as depicted in

JTAC JOINT MISSION TASK LIST 
5.1.  Purpose.  The following three tables comprise the JTAC JMTL, which is comprised of the 
Joint Mission Tasks that have been identified as the minimum tasks required for a JTAC to 
successfully perform TAC. The JMTL is the basis for developing schoolhouse academic training 
syllabus for JTAC certification and qualification training programs. The JMTL will also be used 
during assessments of JTAC training programs and schoolhouses by the JTAC standardization 
team. The Joint Mission Tasks are divided into duty areas for academic application and are listed 
by task and associated sub-tasks. 
5.2.  Duty Area 01 – CAS Planning.  This Duty Area focuses on the minimum classroom 
academics to be instructed. Each Task and Sub-Task will be covered in the schoolhouse/unit lesson 
plan. Lesson plan learning objectives will be based on the Task and Sub-task and be a source for 
test questions. To re-enforce the learning objectives and to assess student comprehension, practical 
exercises (PEs), quizzes, and examinations will be conducted.

Laser Terminal Attack Control—Laser terminal attack control is control of CAS aircraft using 
a laser target designation device or terminal guidance for air-to-ground munitions. A laser terminal 
attack control is defined as control of CAS aircraft using ground-based laser designation equipment 
where the JTAC has direct or indirect control over activation and deactivation. 
Live Terminal Attack Control—Live terminal attack control is control of aircraft where air-to-
ground munitions (live, inert, or training ordnance) are released from the aircraft. 
Live Training—Live training is that which is conducted in a physical environment. It normally 
occurs on ranges/maneuver areas or in a military operating area. 
Mission Essential Tasks List (METL)—A collective task on which an organization trains to be 
proficient in its designed capabilities or assigned mission (DoD Dictionary of Military and 
Associated Terms). Each Air Force unit and aligned or associated Army unit have a unit METL. 
The ASOS specific METL can be found in Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). 
Mission Phase—Mission Phase is the culminating phase of MQT and is meant to prepare the 
student for deployment as a JTAC across the full spectrum of mission sets and tasks that a JTAC 
may encounter. 
Night Terminal Attack Control—Night terminal attack control is control of CAS aircraft at a 
point after EENT and prior to BMNT, with or without the use of night observation devices or 
Infrared (IR) designators. 
Practical Exercise (PE)—A CAS mission PE is a comprehensive training event that includes all 
areas of mission planning, coordination, and execution, but does not involve control of actual 
aircraft. The CAS mission PE is intended to make the most effective use of available training 
sorties by allowing personnel to become familiar with tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to 
an actual mission. Each CAS mission PE could have several different outcomes/training objectives 
based on the instructor’s inputs. The PE provides instant feedback to an instructor and trainee in 
those areas needing improvement. Instructors use actual mission profiles and mission- related 
information to familiarize the trainee with what to expect during all phases of mission execution. 
Additionally, PEs can be used to complete identified CT requirements when live-fly aircraft, 
equipment or ranges are not available to complete live training and the training objectives can be 
met by a combination of discussion, demonstration, and/or performance of the tasks.

AFMAN10-3505V1  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
Precision Strike—The full kinetic and non-kinetic potential of ground, air, space, and cyber 
power to successfully find, fix, and bring effects against an objective or capability. 
Proficiency—Accomplishing a JMTL or METL task correctly and efficiently without assistance. 
Qualified (JTAC)—A certified JTAC who holds a 914/O9C SEI and completes the established 
minimum recurring training IAW Table 4.2 and evaluation requirements. 
Simulated Terminal Attack Control—Simulated terminal attack control is control of virtual 
aircraft in an electronically generated environment. 
Static Phase—Static phase is intended to accomplish JTAC MOA certification Table 4.1 items, 
build the students CAS cadence proficiency, and establish effectiveness in the targeting process 
without the added stress of moving and tracking multiple friendly and enemy positions in a 
dynamic environment. 
Task Evaluation—A task evaluation is the completion of a task under the supervision of a trainer 
to certify the member is capable of performing the task to a Go/No-Go standard. 
Terminal Attack Control—A control consists of at least one aircraft attacking a surface target. 
The control begins with a CAS briefing from a JTAC and ends with either an actual/simulated 
weapons release or an abort on a final attack run. No more than two controls may be counted per 
CAS briefing per target. 
Unqualified (UQ) (JTAC)—Individuals are placed in “unqualified” status after failing to 
complete training or qualification requirements within the allotted training cycle or has failed to 
meet evaluation requirements outlined in AFMAN 10-3505V2. “Unqualified” is a status for when 
a JTAC is not permitted to control aircraft unsupervised. 
Note—Even when an individual is placed in “UQ” status, the JTAC remains a “certified.” 
Virtual Training—Virtual training provides crews, leaders, and units with realistic training 
experiences using a variety of means ranging from sophisticated simulators to practical exercises. 
Simulators operating on virtual terrain take the place of weapon systems and can be linked to 
expand the scope of the training event (e.g., JFS ESC accredited simulator).

planning and staff coordination to include a mission briefing; complete CAS Execution Template 
tasks IAW JP 3-09.3, and mission debriefing. 
A2.2.  Terminal Attack Control Events. 
A2.2.1.  A terminal attack control, or just a control, consists of at least one aircraft attacking a 
surface target. The control begins with a CAS briefing from a JTAC and ends with either an 
actual or simulated weapons release or an abort on a final attack run. No more than two controls 
may be counted per CAS briefing per target. The following events are tasks that may be part 
of a terminal attack control: 
A2.2.1.1.  Type 1 Control.  Type 1 control is used when the JTAC/FAC(A) requires 
control of individual attacks, and the situation requires the JTAC/FAC(A) to visually 
acquire the attacking aircraft and the target for each attack. Reference JP 3-09.3 for 
complete Type 1 control requirements. 
A2.2.1.2.  Type 2 Control.  Type 2 control is used when the JTAC requires control of 
individual attacks and any or all of the following conditions exist: JTAC is unable to 
visually acquire the attacking aircraft at weapons release; JTAC is unable to visually 
acquire the target; or the attacking aircraft is unable to acquire the mark and/or target prior 
to weapons release. See JP 3-09.3 for complete Type 2 control requirements. 
A2.2.1.3.  Type 3 Control.  Type 3 control is used when the JTAC requires the ability to 
provide clearance for multiple attacks within a single engagement, subject to specific attack 
restrictions, and any or all of the following conditions exist: JTAC is unable to visually 
acquire the attacking aircraft at weapons release; JTAC is unable to visually acquire the
