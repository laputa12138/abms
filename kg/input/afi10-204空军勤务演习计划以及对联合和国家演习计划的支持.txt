This instruction implements Department of the Air Force Policy Directive (DAFPD) 10-2, 
Readiness. It provides guidance and procedures for exercise oversight, management, prioritization, 
participation, resourcing, and execution. Furthermore, it provides guidance and procedures for 
United States Air Force (USAF) participation in service, joint service, and combatant commander 
(CCDR) exercises, to include those under the Joint Training Exercise Evaluation Program 
(JTEEP). It establishes the Exercise Coordination Working Group (ECWG) as the lead entity 
responsible for collating, coordinating, adjudicating and prioritizing Secretary of the Air Force 
(SecAF) force participation in service and joint exercises and maintaining visibility on exercise 
participation of combatant command (CCMD) assigned forces. This publication applies to all 
civilian employees and uniformed members of the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve 
(AFR), the Air National Guard (ANG), and those who are contractually obligated to comply with 
Department of the Air Force publications. This publication does not apply to the United States 
Space Force (USSF) and AFR and ANG units and personnel performing space missions. USSF 
and applicable AFR and ANG units performing space missions should reference Space Force 
Instruction (SPFI) 10-204, Exercise Program for applicable information regarding the USSF 
Exercise Program. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are 
identified with a Tier (T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3) number following the compliance statement. See 
Department of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) 90-161, Publishing Processes and Procedures,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been revised and should be completely reviewed. The revision standardizes 
“USAF” to denote the Air Force service in accordance with DAFMAN 90-161. It reflects the 
establishment of USSF as a service and removes the space mission from the USAF. Included are 
updates to office symbols and titles in accordance with current organizations. This version reflects 
changes in exercise management through the ECWG and the Master Exercise Calendar (MEC) 
and removes the requirement for the MEC Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). It updates 
terminology and exercise oversight objectives from Chief of Staff of the Air Force’s (CSAF) 
Operational Training and Test Infrastructure 2035 Flight Plan. This document expands the scope 
to add USAF service exercises, in addition to Joint Exercise Program (JEP) and National Exercise 
Program (NEP), policy and guidance. This revision also removes Attachment 3, Individual Joint 
Training.

Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This instruction provides guidance and procedures for the planning, execution, and 
assessment of the United States Air Force (USAF) exercise program. Exercises validate USAF 
aviation, cyber, informational warfare, electronic warfare, logistics, tactical and operational 
command and control, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) forces’ ability to 
execute presidentially ordered CCDR Unified Command Plan (UCP) missions. As directed by the 
CSAF’s Operational Training and Test Infrastructure Flight Plan 2035, exercises prepare USAF 
forces for deployments and combat operations when allocated by the Secretary of Defense 
(SecDef) as approved in the Secretary of Defense Orders Book (SDOB) and ordered in the Global 
Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP). Exercises are a critical component of readiness 
training and assessment. Exercises are culminating events used to stress and evaluate USAF forces 
to ensure they are ready to perform designated core tactical and operational level of war functions. 
Furthermore, exercises help USAF commanders evaluate the readiness of their units. 
1.2.  USAF Exercise Enterprise. 
1.2.1.  Chairman’s, Joint, and National Exercises. The Chairman’s Exercise Program (CEP) is 
designed to improve capability and the readiness of U.S. Forces to perform joint operations 
through the conduct of regularly scheduled strategic, national-level exercises that examine 
plans, policies, and procedures under various simulated crisis situations. The Joint Exercise 
Program (JEP) is a principal means for CCDRs to maintain trained and ready forces, exercise 
their contingency plans, and support their theater campaign plan engagement activities. The 
National Exercise Program (NEP) is a top-down driven exercise framework under the 
leadership of the President of the United States that is the basis for coordination of federal 
exercises across all departments and agencies of the federal government. The DoD participates 
in the NEP through the CEP. 
1.2.1.1.  USAF units participate in CEP and JEP exercises to hone and refine execution of 
mission essential and supporting tasks, improve response capabilities, and enhance and 
evaluate readiness. The Air Force goal is to optimize the benefits of participating in these 
exercises, but not at the expense of service core functions and readiness. Exercise 
objectives should test CSAF focus areas and drive towards refining USAF doctrine, tactics, 
techniques and procedures (TTP) in joint and coalition combat operations. 
1.2.1.2.  SecAF forces and CCDR assigned USAF forces will support and participate in 
CEP/JEP/NEP exercises when requested by the organization conducting event (OCE) if 
scenarios are appropriate to their mission and units have capacity to support. (T-1) Air 
National Guard (ANG) units will participate in exercises based on their wings’ training 
plan. (T-1) 
1.2.1.3.  The JTEEP program is the primary source of joint training funding. See Chapter 
5 for details on this program. 
1.2.1.4.  Assigned and unassigned USAF forces may participate in sister service exercises 
to meet joint or service core function readiness requirements.

AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
1.2.2.  SecAF Exercises. SecAF exercises are defined as any exercise owned, conducted, and 
designated by Headquarters Air Force (HAF), major command (MAJCOM)/component 
MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM), numbered Air Force (NAF)/component NAF (C-NAF) or National 
Guard Bureau (NGB) that fulfills SecAF’s mandate. SecAF exercises are service-level events 
designed to accomplish USAF and USSF readiness requirements for air, space, information, 
and cyberspace forces and to train these forces for CCDR UCP missions. CCDR UCP missions 
are outlined in Commander, Air Force Forces Campaign Support Plan (CSP) and USAF CSP. 
1.3.  Exercise Domains and Training Environments.  USAF forces exercise in the air, space, 
land, maritime, information, and cyberspace domains using live, synthetic (virtual and/or 
constructive) or blended (live-synthetic) training environments. There are many types or modes of 
exercises appropriate to accomplish and support joint training. Examples include field training 
exercises (FTX) and command post exercises (CPX). Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is a source 
of academics for planners and participants. 
1.4.  Doctrine for Exercises.  Doctrine is critical to unify the actions of the Armed Forces of the 
United States in war. It is through doctrine that the joint Force operates successfully to defeat US 
adversaries. 
1.4.1.  Joint doctrine can be found at http://www.jcs.mil/Doctrine. Air Force basic and 
operational doctrine is available at the doctrine website: http://doctrine.af.mil. 
1.4.2.  Air Land Sea Application Center (ALSA) serves as the definitive source for multi- 
service tactical level solutions to multi-service interoperability issues consistent with joint and 
service doctrine, leveraging multi-service TTPs. ALSA publications are available at 
http://www.alsa.mil. 
1.5.  Exercise Authorities.  USAF forces are either CCDR assigned (aligned under C- MAJCOM, 
C-NAF) or SecAF unassigned/service retained. Assigned forces are ordered by the SecDef via 
assignment tables directed in the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) 
annually in the Forces for Unified Commands Memorandum (“Forces For”). For the purposes of 
this AFI, SecAF forces are synonymous with SecAF unassigned/service retained forces. SecAF 
forces are allocated (transferred/attached) to CCDRs per the GFMAP which is authorized by 
SecDef via the SDOB. CCDR assigned forces can also be allocated to other CCDRs using the 
same process used for allocation of SecAF forces. 
1.5.1.  SecDef rarely allocates CCDR assigned or SecAF forces for exercises. If SecDef does 
order an exercise, it will be in the GFMAP and ordered in the SDOB. Pre-deployment 
preparation exercises can be ordered in existing exercise orders (EXORD) but typically require 
coordination between the supported CCDR and service secretary if the exercise starts before 
the transfer/deployment of forces latest arrival date. 
1.5.2.  If not ordered by SecDef, SecAF forces participating in exercises do so under SecAF’s 
Administrative Control (ADCON) authority as outlined in Joint Publication (JP) 1, Volume 2, 
The Joint Force. However, a CCDR has tactical control for exercise purposes whenever forces 
not assigned to that CCDR undertake exercises in that CCDR’s area of responsibility (AOR). 
Tactical control when these forces enter the AOR. Assigned forces participating in exercises 
typically do so under operational control authority delegated by the CCDR to their commander,  
 
 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
7 
Air Forces (C-MAJCOM, C-NAF). Unit commanders should confirm with their chain of 
command the source of the exercise tasking and ascertain intent with regards to exercise 
participation. Refer to JP 1, Volume 2 and GFMIG for additional caveats to command authority 
for units participating in CCDR exercises. 
1.5.3.  Movement of forces to meet training, readiness, or exercise requirements are not 
considered deployments and, therefore, are not subject to deployment-to-dwell and 
mobilization-to-dwell limits and specified goals. Guidance on the integration of international 
personnel to an exercise is provided in AFI 16-115, Managing International Participation in 
Flying Exercises, and AFMAN 16-101, Security Cooperation (SC) and Security Assistance 
(SA) Management. International personnel are most commonly integrated to Level 1 Exercises 
(see Figure 1.1), and their assignment is considered similar to the TDY assignment of SecAF-
retained forces. When a significant international contingent is incorporated to an exercise 
(aircraft and personnel), the hosting MAJCOM’s international affairs component will ensure 
their participation is compliant with guidance in the Arms Export Control Act. 
1.6.  Prioritization of Exercises and Support Resources. 
1.6.1.  According to JP 1, Volume 2, CCDRs have combatant command (COCOM) authority 
over assigned forces and are directly responsible to the President of the United States and 
SecDef for the performance of assigned missions and the preparedness of their commands. As 
directed in JP 1, Volume 2, CCDRs exercise COCOM authority to task and prioritize assigned 
and attached forces to conduct joint exercises and training. SecAF prioritizes Air Force 
exercises and support as they pertain to forces under SecAF ADCON to organize, train, and 
equip. For the purposes of this AFI, USAF service-level exercises will be referred to as SecAF 
exercises as distinct from CCDR and joint exercises. 
1.6.2.  The prioritization of SecAF exercises for unassigned/service retained forces is regulated 
by the readiness of the force as established by requirements defined in Department of Defense 
Directive (DoDD) 5100.01, Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major 
Components. Figure 1.1 provides a visual representation of force readiness requirements as 
they relate to SecAF exercises. The matrix should be read left to right then top to bottom to 
establish a 3-Category division each with three sub-levels. SecAF and CCDR exercise planners 
may use this matrix as a reference in order to establish requirements and priorities.

1.7.  Exercise Scheduling and Management. 
1.7.1.  Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS). JTIMS is the chairman’s 
authoritative information management system supporting planning and execution of the Joint 
Training System (JTS). JTIMS is the enterprise solution available for use by all DoD 
components to identify and validate joint training requirements and assess mission essential 
tasks (METs) exercised during a prescribed event. This assessment of METs can then inform 
the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) to report readiness. JTIMS supports all 
readiness priorities through scheduling and coordination and enables all DoD components to 
identify challenges. In addition, lessons learned (L2) can be entered into JTIMS and pushed 
into the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS). 
1.7.2.  In accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3500.01J 
Joint Training Policy for the Armed Forces of the Unites States, CCMDs, Components, the 
joint force, or military departments requesting USAF forces will input exercise data into 
JTIMS per their higher headquarters guidance when requiring personnel to participate in non-
unit hosted exercises (including those in, synthetic, live or blended (live-synthetic) 
environments). (T-0) JTIMS supports the coordination and efficient use of resources to 
participate in exercises. Forces participating in large force employment (LFE) exercises at 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
9 
home station are not required to be input into JTIMS; however, major named synthetic 
exercises (i.e., VIRTUAL FLAG) will be entered in JTIMS. This stipulation does not restrict 
those exercises from being entered if the unit would like to use JTIMS as a scheduling tool or 
in preparation for expanding the size and scope of a home station LFE exercise. Units should 
use JTIMS to request forces if a home station LFE exercise expansion includes joint or other 
assigned or unassigned USAF forces. (T-0) 
1.7.2.1.  JTIMS is the data source to capture the exercise demand signal leveraged on 
USAF forces from CCDR, CJCS, JEP, NEP, and USAF exercises. In addition, JTIMS is a 
resource for informing USAF senior leadership decisions when it comes to prioritizing 
SecAF forces support to CCDR and joint service exercises. Exercise inputs in JTIMS do 
not constitute orders or delegate authority. JTIMS will sunset in fiscal year (FY) 24 and be 
replaced by Joint Training Tool (JTT). Units will follow normal protocols and chain of 
command to participate or support an exercise. 
1.7.2.2.  USAF force capability support to CCDR or joint service exercises requires a 
JTIMS force request (FR). OCEs and exercise planners will reference the JTIMS 
submission timelines directed by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 
3500.03E, Joint Training Manual for the Armed Forces of the United States, for standard 
and emergent force requests. Emergent requests for SecAF forces or assigned forces from 
another CCMD inside of 12 months before exercise execution require additional 
coordination with the ECWG and Director of Training and Readiness (AF/A3T) to 
determine force availability. 
1.7.2.3.  Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS). MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C- 
NAFs and NGB will use the CPS for the unit level detail of each exercise to augment the 
service component requirements in JTIMS. (T-0) Since the transition to CPS from JTIMS 
may take some time, current MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM scheduling tools may be used after 
coordination with AF/A3T to validate compatibility with the MEC. The MEC is an 
enterprise approach to operational training information management. It provides a single 
source view of assigned and unassigned USAF forces participation in SecAF, CCDR and 
CEP/JEP/NEP exercises. To aid the ECWG, the MEC will include exercise information 
from JTIMS, Magellan, CPS and other MAJCOM scheduling tools. The ECWG’s review 
and refinement of the MEC allows all MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMS, NAFs/C-NAFs and 
NGB to have a common picture of the USAF exercise enterprise to synchronize events and 
prioritize resources. 
1.7.2.4.  The combination of JTIMS and CPS data allows senior leader visibility of the 
entire USAF exercise enterprise and the associated weight-of-effort of each exercise 
included in the MEC. The MEC also provides a mechanism for operational units to assess 
the level- of-effort over time, view overlapping/conflicting exercises, and seek 
opportunities to link or combine events. Finally, the MEC will provide data related to 
USAF readiness metrics and objectives. MAJCOMS/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs and 
NGB will ensure any additional readiness exercises scheduled after the ECWG are loaded 
in JTIMS and CPS to facilitate upload in the MEC.

ECWG. NGB exercises may use the ANG Mission Ready Airlift program for exercises 
and support. The use of special airlift assignment mission for exercises does not infer a 
higher lift priority over other missions. Requester must also include the appropriate 
transportation account code (TAC) for reporting. 
12 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
2.7.2.3.  AMC must finalize available support to include cancellations 15 working days 
prior to scheduled movement date in order to allow support requesters time to procure 
alternate logistical support and prevent detrimental shortfalls in exercise execution due to 
late arrival by key players in the case of cancellations. It also prevents the waste of 
government resources to book redundant commercial travel regarding tentative airlift or 
tanker support. 
2.8.  MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs and NGB will: 
2.8.1.  Maintain exercise responsibility, programming, authority, and resource allocation over 
their respective SecAF tactical, operational and strategic level exercises, and those CCDR 
exercises for which they are the OCE. Identify planned AFR and ANG requirements to AF/A3 
for incorporation into the Air Reserve Component (ARC) Utilization Cycle in accordance with 
AFI 10-301, Managing Operational Utilization Requirements of the Air Reserve Component 
Forces. In addition, provide ARC man-day requirements IAW Department of the Air Force 
Instruction (DAFI) 36-2619, Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) – Active Component 
(AC) Man-Day Program. 
2.8.2.  Provide supplemental guidance, as needed, to clarify SecAF exercise planning, 
controlling, executing, and evaluating functions and responsibilities. 
2.8.3.  Ensure SecAF exercise activities help command and subordinate units achieve and 
maintain their designed operational capability and are able to fulfill operation plan (OPLAN) 
taskings and appropriately respond to contingencies, such as natural disasters or terrorist 
incidents. 
2.8.4.  Conduct a safety review and risk management review with all affected agencies. 
2.8.5.  Establish a headquarters-level OPR to implement their SecAF and joint exercise 
participation programs and oversee and monitor the exercise activities of subordinate units. 
2.8.6.  Establish a command interface POC with AF/A3T for overall SecAF and joint exercise 
planning and coordination. 
2.8.7.  Attend SecAF and joint exercise planning conferences, as required and ensure unit 
weapons systems/force element objectives are included in exercise scenarios. 
2.8.8.  Coordinate SIF, commercial ticket program (CTP), and port handling/inland 
transportation (PH/IT) JEP requirements with AF/A3T. 
2.8.9.  Manage allocated CE2 SIF budget. 
2.8.10.  Support ECWG requirements and activities for SecAF and CEP/JEP scheduling. 
2.8.11.  Coordinate with AF/A3T and Lead MAJCOM (ACC) for updates and maintenance of 
the MEC for SecAF and joint exercises. 
2.8.12.  Coordinate with SAF/IA and SAF/FM to plan/program/budget infrastructure 
requirements to enable international participation in exercises. 
2.8.13.  Conduct readiness exercises per AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System. 
 
 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023

2.9.  MAJCOMs and NGB will: 
2.9.1.  Program, manage, and execute funds for SecAF exercises for which they are OCE. 
2.9.2.  Plan, program, and execute activities for CCDR and other unassigned joint service 
forces participating in their respective USAF exercises. 
2.9.3.  Provide ARC man-day requirements to Air Staff IAW DAFI 36-2619. 
2.10.  C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs will: 
2.10.1.  Program, manage and execute funds for both their SecAF and CCDR exercises. 
2.10.2.  Plan, program, and execute activities for SecAF forces participating in their respective 
CCDR service component exercises for which they are OCE. 
2.10.3.  Facilitate planning and execution of CE2 funded exercises sponsored by their 
respective CCDR. 
2.10.4.  Provide ARC man-day requirements for all applicable exercise participants to Air Staff 
IAW DAFI 36-2619. 
2.10.5.  Assist supported commands in the planning and execution of CEP, JEP and NEP 
exercises. 
2.10.6.  Ensure DRRS reflects readiness assessment garnered from exercise participation. 
2.10.7.  Follow the JTEEP funding process outlined in CJCSM 3511.01A, Joint Training 
Resources for the Armed Forces of the United States (see Chapter 5). 
2.11.  MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB exercise program managers will: 
2.11.1.  Follow the JTS methodology to establish requirements as outlined in Chapter 3. 
2.11.2.  Enter SecAF exercise and JEP/NEP requirements into JTIMS for visibility on exercise 
demand, joint and SecAF FRs, and requests for support from resources with limited force 
structure (i.e., tankers/airlift). Enter unit level details in the CPS or other approved schedule 
management system. 
2.11.3.  Identify resource and unit/weapon system/force element requirements for the exercises 
they plan, program, manage and execute. 
2.11.4.  Identify and coordinate with the appropriate parent C-MAJCOM, C-NAF or NGB to 
request these resources and weapon systems prior to the ECWG (see paragraph 2.13.). 
2.11.5.  Ensure scenarios meet objectives of all weapon systems participating in and/or 
supporting exercises to include supporting forces (e.g., airlift and air refueling). 
2.11.6.  Coordinate with operational training managers to ensure exercise objectives meet 
deployment spin-up, Ready Aircrew Program (or weapon system equivalent), or other realistic 
training requirements. 
2.11.7.  Coordinate on events that require USAF participation and, when appropriate, create or 
change events to meet USAF readiness requirements. 
2.11.8.  Identify OTI requirements needed to develop realistic, relevant, and rigorous live and 
synthetic exercise scenarios. 
14 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
2.11.9.  Adhere to CSAF and AF/A3 guidance on JADC2, coalition, and joint interoperability 
training and readiness. 
2.11.10.  Ensure SecAF and CCMD assigned USAF organizations that participate in 
CEP/JEP/NEP exercises accomplish the following: 
2.11.10.1.  Fully support exercise planning, execution, and evaluation. Include joint and 
multi-national partners as required to cover their exercise objectives and to ensure full 
integration with the exercise. 
2.11.10.2.  Provide trusted agents, as needed, to design and control the exercise. 
2.12.  Unit Commanders will: 
2.12.1.  Ensure the exercises in which they participate contribute to unit readiness and meet 
the training requirements and standards described in the following: 
2.12.1.1.  Designed operational capability and service mission essential task list (METL) 
for all USAF forces and associated OPLANs and joint METLs for CCDR assigned forces 
as specified in DRRS. 
2.12.1.2.  Service and CCMD exercise plans, directives and reporting instructions. 
2.12.2.  Develop and execute training plans to prepare participants for exercises. Exercises are 
a training program adjunct and provide an opportunity to practice TTPs in a controlled 
environment. Commanders and exercise participants must determine the live and/or synthetic 
training they require to properly prepare them for a particular exercise and ensure that training 
is accomplished before the event. 
2.13.  Exercise Coordination Working Group (ECWG). 
2.13.1.  ACC as Lead MAJCOM (delegable to ACC/A3O) shall chair the ECWG and is 
responsible to AF/A3 for scheduling and executing the annual exercise guidance. The ECWG 
shall synchronize the USAF exercise requirements planning with the JTS process outlined in 
Chapter 3. 
2.13.2.  The ECWG is an action officer-level working group and will be attended by all 
MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB exercise planning, operational training, and 
scheduling offices (unit funded). See Attachment 2 for the list of attendees. The ECWG is 
chartered to capture both SecAF and CCDR air component (USAF air, and cyberspace) 
exercise demand, while coordinating and prioritizing exercise enablers and support. The 
ECWG is not a scheduling entity but rather a body charged with identifying, synchronizing, 
and prioritizing exercise requirements. 
2.13.3.  ECWG roles and responsibilities. 
 
 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
15 
2.13.3.1.  Build the MAJCOM’s/C-MAJCOM’s, NAF’s/C-NAF’s and NGB’s awareness 
of the USAF exercise enterprise including USAF forces’ participation in SecAF, and 
CCDR or joint service exercises. The ECWG is the forum that allows representatives to 
identify readiness training gaps and to establish the optimal number of exercises based on 
available USAF force structure. The ECWG also recommends options to consolidate and 
synchronize resources in order to prevent waste due to exercise overlap or duplication with 
a goal of eliminating redundancies. Any additions or deletions must be approved in 
accordance with guidelines established by the ECWG prior to the start of the FY of 
execution. 
2.13.3.2.  Oversee Exercise Scheduling and Management. Maintaining a USAF exercise 
enterprise schedule is a crucial component of exercise oversight. USAF senior leaders and 
commanders at all levels need a common and easily accessible MEC to aid in training and 
readiness assessments. The ECWG is the forum for MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAF/C- 
NAF and NGB to codify readiness training requirements and ensure the most accurate data 
is available to populate the MEC. The MEC contains data from several sources to include 
JTIMS, Magellan, Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS) and other MAJCOM scheduling 
tools. 
2.13.3.3.  While the ECWG will make recommendations based on asset availability and 
readiness requirements, the authority to prioritize exercise participation remains with the 
MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB commanders for their respective 
assigned and unassigned/service retained forces. 
2.13.4.  The ECWG will: 
2.13.4.1.  Query JTIMS, CPS and other schedule management tools for the USAF exercise 
demand requirements and assess resource availability. 
2.13.4.2.  Coordinate SecAF forces’ participation in CEP/JEP/NEP, CCDR and SecAF 
exercises as defined in paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2. Reference Attachment 2 for additional 
guidance. 
2.13.4.3.  Balance exercise participation based on USAF forces’ readiness requirements 
and CCDR and USAF CSP mission training and preparation. 
2.13.4.4.  Look holistically at the various live and synthetic exercise requirements, assess 
ability to source, and make recommendations to combine or link exercises to meet 
readiness requirements while not over-stressing warfighting units. 
2.13.4.5.  Identify exercises best suited to incorporate joint, multi-national, and multi-
domain interoperability training. 
2.13.4.6.  Assess requests for USAF forces to augment sister service exercises, and 
nominate units as required based on readiness training requirements. 
2.13.4.7.  Validate the MEC. 
2.13.5.  The ECWG chair will establish the timing of events and deliverables based on 
synchronization with MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB exercise build 
timelines. Figure 2.1 provides an overview of the ECWG inputs, outputs, and approval 
process.

Chapter 3 
EXERCISE LIFE CYCLE PROCESS OVERVIEW 
3.1.  Joint Event Life Cycle (JELC).  To standardize the life cycle of the USAF exercise 
enterprise, exercise program managers at all echelons will design exercises from the planned 
requirements and assess exercise results using those same requirements. (T-2) Exercise planners 
will utilize CJCSM 3500.03E and reference the JELC as a model for managing USAF exercises. 
(T-2) The programming cycle of USAF exercises should take 12-18 months from the design stage 
to the evaluation, analysis, and reports stage. The ECWG’s process should also reflect the JELC’s 
methodology and timeline. 
Figure 3.1.  JTS Four Phase Process and the Joint Event Life Cycle. 
 
3.1.1.  Use the most current CJCSM 3500.03E processes as a model to the maximum extent 
possible. USAF exercises are part of the JTS as Tier 3 events. The tiers outlined in CJCSM 
3500.03E do not reflect the relative importance of an exercise, rather the level of effort required 
to plan and execute within the joint training program. Therefore, Tier 3 does not denote third 
priority since USAF exercises fulfill SecAF mandate for training which would make it first 
priority from a USAF service readiness perspective. Matching the joint processes is not 
intended to prioritize joint training or joint training events; rather, it simply provides a common 
language across the military for the purpose of synergy in planning, executing, and assessing 
training events. 
3.1.2.  Tailor exercise reporting instructions to meet exercise requirements. These might 
include specialized personal equipment for the purposes of exercise objectives, country 
requirements IAW the Foreign Clearance Guide found on the web address 
https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Forms-Directives-Instructions/, additional security 
requirements, or other information or instructions for the purpose of executing the exercise. 
The reporting instructions should not be an attempt to match deployment requirements as they 
are most likely outside of the realm of the exercise and not required for participation. 
3.1.3.  Exercise reporting instructions and/or exercise directive (EXDIR) should be posted on 
Air Force Force Generation (AFFORGEN) located at the following web address 
https://tmis.us.af.mil/afforgenconnect. 
18 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
3.2.  Exercise Requirements.  To aid in initial requirements assessment, reference and use the 
joint planning process found in JP 5-0, Joint Planning. The joint planning process begins when an 
appropriate authority recognizes potential for military capability to be employed in response to a 
potential or actual crisis. Exercise planners may tailor the 7-step process for their use; however, 
the following steps cover the majority of items necessary to develop exercise requirements: Step 
1 – Planning Initiation, Step 2 – Mission Analysis, and Step 7 – Plan or Order Development (i.e., 
EXDIR). 
3.2.1.  Exercise Directives (EXDIR). EXDIRs should typically follow the standard joint 
exercise directive format found in CJCSM 3500.03E. When appropriate, participating USAF 
organizations (Air Staff, MAJCOM, etc.) will assist the exercise sponsor with EXDIR 
development. Depending on exercise complexity, duration and level of participation, USAF 
organizations may, at their discretion, create an organizational EXDIR to clarify exercise 
requirements and responsibilities during the exercise requirements development. 
3.2.2.  Several resources are available for MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB 
exercise planners to reference to ensure events are realistic, relevant and meet unit readiness 
and/or CCDR mission requirements. 
3.2.2.1.  Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMETL). Reference JMETLs to exercise 
CCDR METs that also match USAF core functions. 
3.2.2.2.  The Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) should be used in developing joint mission 
essential task lists (JMETL). The UJTL Task Development Tool and the UJTL can be 
found at the following web address: https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp?pindex=43. 
3.2.2.3.  Reference AF/A3’s exercise guidance per paragraph 2.3. 
3.2.2.4.  Review DRRS for readiness requirements and gaps to help inform exercise 
requirements, objectives, and joint, multi-national, and JADC2 participants. 
3.2.2.5.  Review operational, logistical, support, and force protection requirements, 
applicable plans, after action reports (AARs), L2 databases, corrective action reports, 
observation reports, and guidance from higher headquarters to determine appropriate 
venue, exercise objectives, and to ensure the exercise design supports desired objectives. 
3.2.3.  Master Scenario Event List (MSEL). The MSEL is a chronological database in JTIMS 
of planned events and expected player actions that exercise controllers use to manage and guide 
the exercise to achieve exercise objectives. MSEL development and/or synchronization 
conferences allow exercise planners to oversee scenario development and execution 
coordination. Exercise planners will only release the MSEL to trusted agents and cannot 
release to exercise participants. (T-2) MSELs should stress exercise participants to perform 
complex wartime missions. Exercises provide commanders an opportunity to assess the ability 
of their units to perform their missions under “no-fault” conditions. Exercise participants 
should have the “freedom to fail” within the bounds of safe operations and the need to meet 
exercise objectives. 
3.2.4.  To articulate exercise requirements, exercise planners should send appropriate 
representatives to the ECWG (unit funded) or provide applicable higher headquarters details 
on exercise requirements and additional MAJCOM or weapon systems participation to enhance 
JADC2 and multi-functional interoperability training. 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
19 
3.2.5.  C-MAJCOMs/C-NAFs should provide operational-level air component exercise 
requirements to the Operational Command and Control Working Group (OC2WG). The 
OC2WG is held twice per year to feed this information to the ECWG. 
3.3.  USAF Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Support.  For level 1, 2, and 3 exercises requiring 
USAF M&S support, USAF M&S support performance metrics/objectives will be defined and 
communicated to the MAJCOMs and the Chief Modeling and Simulation Office. (T-2) 
3.4.  Exercise Planning and Sourcing.  During the planning cycle, each MAJCOM/C- 
MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF or NGB will request sourcing for their respective exercises. As noted in 
paragraph 2.13.3.1, the ECWG serves as a forum for exercise planners to advocate for support, 
prioritize requirements, and maximize the use of the USAF force structure. The NGB may 
establish events for ANG unit readiness; however, any exercise that requires SecAF forces or 
CCMD assigned USAF forces must be coordinated with the ECWG. (T-1) 
3.4.1.  C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs will source their CCDR exercises from their parent CCDR’s 
assigned forces first. C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs coordinate with Air Force Personnel Center, 
Force Generation Operations and Readiness Division(AFPC/DPMW) for contingency 
sourcing of service retained/conventional combat support forces from other MAJCOMs and 
NGB. Force requests should be coordinated, vetted, and processed in JTIMS prior to 
submission to AFPC/DPMW. C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs should notify AFPC/DPMW of 
approved and vetted force requests for respective exercise support and/or CCDR training 
events. Force requirements should be component processed through all aspects of assigned 
asset ownership (from unit to MAJCOM level) and submitted via respective force module(s) 
to AFPC/DPMW. These requirements should be processed 120 days prior to Required 
Delivery Date (RDD) or exercise start date, but not later than 30 days. This does not apply to 
by name requests and C-MAJCOM/C-NAF shortfalls as these are not submitted in JTIMS. C-
MAJCOMs and C-NAFs shall not solicit support directly for service Retained forces or ANG 
units below MAJCOM level without receiving coordination authority from that unit’s parent 
MAJCOM or NGB. 
3.4.2.  MAJCOMs source for their USAF exercises from their respective SecAF units first. 
MAJCOMs will coordinate with other MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs and NGB 
for assigned and/or allocated volunteers. (T-1) MAJCOMs will not solicit support directly with 
C- MAJCOMs and C-NAFs assigned and/or allocated or ANG units below MAJCOM level 
without receiving coordination authority from that unit’s parent C-MAJCOM, C-NAF or NGB. 
3.4.3.  JADC2 and multi-functional exercises require a number of combat support/combat 
service support, demand force teams and force multiplier resources to include, but not limited 
to: cyber operations forces, ISR, tactical and operational C2, electronic warfare, and a host of 
joint and multi-national capabilities. Since many of these resources are considered high 
demand/low density, early sourcing requests and engagement with the ECWG is critical to 
secure these assets. ISR platforms execute their mission using distributed forces with a 
combination of aircraft, crew and distributed common ground system or other reach-back 
mission crew. Therefore, when soliciting support for ISR platforms, exercise planners should 
request not only the individual platforms, but also the distributed force’s support accordingly. 
Forces flying the ISR platform shall not commit distributed forces support or vice versa 
without coordinating with their parent MAJCOM. (T-2) 
20 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
3.4.4.  Sourcing should be modeled after the global force management  process outlined in 
CJCSM 3130.06C, Global Force Management Allocation Policies and Procedures and JP 3-
35, Deployment and Redeployment Operations. Use of these processes as a model does not 
infer actual authorities are being exercised. The purpose, rather, is to use established processes 
for accountability, transportation, and logistics. This AFI gives commanders providing forces 
and/or exercise planners the option to exercise some, part, or all of the deployment or 
redeployment processes found in JP 3-35. Joint Operational Planning and Execution System 
(JOPES) is an integrated joint command and control system used to support military operation 
monitoring, planning, and execution activities. Additionally, sourcing should also be modeled 
after the AFFORGEN model to ensure combat readiness for the total force to support global 
contingencies as per paragraph 3.7. 
3.4.4.1.  When required, a deployment requirements manning document (DRMD) will be 
entered into Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) no 
later than 30 days prior to the start of exercise (STARTEX). (T-2) DCAPES is a sourcing 
and management tool for USAF forces and is the apparatus by which USAF force 
movements occur. DCAPES taskings for SecAF forces must be properly coordinated and 
supported by the appropriate authority IAW DAFI 10-401, Operations Planning and 
Execution and AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. (T-2) Per paragraph 
2.13.4.2 above, the ECWG will review, assess, and prioritize these taskings to support 
SecAF, JEP, CEP, NEP events before officially tasked in DCAPES to ensure force 
availability. 
3.4.4.2.  ANG forces will use DCAPES when required for OCONUS or OCONUS CCMD 
exercises when contingency, exercise, and deployment (CED) orders are required. For 
CONUS or any other Title 32 NGB exercise, DCAPES may be required for ANG force 
participation. 
3.4.5.  A Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) is required for JEP/CEP events 
per CJCSM 3122.02F, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Volume III, 
Time Phased Force and Deployment Data Development and Deployment Execution for 
accountability, transportation, and logistics. (T-0) The resulting exercise TPFDD and CED 
orders are then used to manage funding and transportation. All funding and transportation 
using Headquarters, AFRC reserve personnel appropriation (RPA) funding will be obligated 
and managed on the AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active 
Tour using Air Force Reserve Orders Writing System-Reserve and voucher processing under 
the Defense Travel System (DTS)/Reserve Travel System(RTS). A statement will be typed on 
the CED order noting, "Funding is provided on the AF Form 938.” Although CED orders are 
required any time a TPFDD is generated and placed in execution, this stipulation does not 
prevent a unit commander from proceeding under DTS authorization or verbal orders of 
commanding officer (VOCO) and ensuring the completion of the CED orders after the fact. 
SecAF exercises that support a CCMD OPLAN and operation order may be required to be 
entered into JOPES for funding/validation by the supported CCMD and USTRANSCOM. 
MAJCOMS will serve as the decision authority as to whether a specific SecAF or CCMD 
service component exercise will be entered in JOPES for TPFDD generation and use. When 
CED orders are not required, exercise participants may travel via DTS authorization. 
 
 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
21 
3.4.6.  CCMD, service component, and joint exercise planners and/or the exercise execution 
authority will submit an FR via JTIMS per CJCSM 3130.06C. (T-1) An exercise execution 
authority is anyone within the CCMD, service component, joint force, or military department 
with the authority to validate and obligate funds for the exercise requesting forces. FR 
validation is accomplished by the exercise planners and/or exercise execution authority 
through the JOPES process by having the service component and/or CCMD validate the 
TPFDD. Last minute additions to the DRMD may be validated by the exercise planners and/or 
an exercise execution authority via memo, e-mail, or as a last resort, verbally. All last-minute 
additions will be added to the TPFDD as soon as possible but not later than 10 working days 
after FR validation or STARTEX, whichever is later. (T-1) 
3.4.7.  Synthetic and Blended Exercises. Exercises conducted in the synthetic or blended 
operational training environment require extensive network setup and testing that may require 
considerable time. In addition, networks will require an authority to operate at the appropriate 
classification level. 
3.4.8.  Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for Combined Exercises. Whenever USAF forces 
participate with foreign countries in an exercise, the United States may or may not have a 
SOFA or similar arrangement with the host nation to cover the protection of US forces while 
deployed for the exercise. Exercise planners will check on the status of agreements for all 
nations where USAF forces will participate. If a SOFA does not exist, the Foreign Clearance 
Guide provides some guidance on what laws/agreements US forces are subject to while in the 
host country. To help clarify the status of exercise participants, an Exercise Support 
Agreement, MOU, MOA or similar agreement should be negotiated and concluded with host 
nations in advance of the exercise. Guidance on writing the agreement is provided in DoD 
Instruction (DoDI) 5530.03, International Agreements, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 51-403, 
International Agreements, and Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 51-706, Status of Forces 
Policies, Procedures, and Information. Coordinate with your servicing staff judge advocate’s 
office to determine the existence of such an agreement regarding a particular country or for 
assistance in preparing an agreement. Air Staff may coordinate, to determine the existence of 
such an agreement, with SAF/IA, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the 
General Counsel, Deputy General Counsel for Intelligence, International & Military Affairs 
(SAF/GCI)and Headquarter Air Force, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Operations and 
International Law (AF/JAO). These Directorates can provide details about existing agreements 
concluded by Secretariat and Air Staff organizations and MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs within their 
agreement repositories. If a new agreement is required, contact AF/JAO about drafting an 
agreement within their realm of responsibility. 
3.4.9.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM may be used to provide indirect mission support 
for CJCS and USAF exercises with proper approval/authorization and funding, as outlined in 
AFI 25-101, Air Force War Reserve Materiel (WRM). Commanders and Inspectors will not 
use WRM assets for exercises without appropriate release authority. (T-1) 
 
 
22 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
3.4.10.  Environmental Considerations. MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB 
exercise managers will ensure exercises receive the appropriate degree of environmental 
impact analysis before execution. (T-0) Exercise managers will ensure environmental analysis 
and planning is reflected in the JOPES and documentation is captured in an annex to the 
exercise plan or operation order. Exercise planners will ensure exercises conducted in the 
United States, comply with applicable Federal, State, and local environmental requirements. 
(T-0) Exercise planners will ensure exercises conducted outside the United States comply with 
applicable federal law, international agreements, Chapter 2, AFI 32-7001, Environmental 
Management and Chapter 3, AFI 32-7091, Environmental Management Outside the United 
States. (T-0) 
3.4.11.  Orders for Individual and Unit Exercise Participation. 
3.4.11.1.  If a unit commander authorizes/issues a DTS authorization, written or VOCO, 
the force requirement and funds must be validated by the CCMD, service component, joint, 
or military department exercise planners and/or the exercise execution authority. 
Commanders will also ensure applicable exercise funds have been obligated by the 
appropriate MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF or NGB for their unit’s participation. 
(T-2) If the force requirement is not validated and/or funds not authorized, the unit 
approving the travel authorization shall be liable for the TDY costs without reimbursement. 
3.4.11.2.  If the TPFDD is locked and cannot be opened before STARTEX and there is a 
CCMD, service component, or joint force validated force requirement, unit commanders 
may send forces on DTS authorization. The exercise managers should ensure the 
individual’s information is entered into the TPFDD for accountability after the fact. The 
force coordinator, typically ACC/A3O for USAF forces or C-MAJCOM/C-NAF for 
assigned/allocated forces, will be notified of any last-minute changes to ensure individual 
has access to funding organizations line of accounting and appropriately cross-org in DTS. 
(T-3) Obtaining a line of accounting/DTS label mitigates unit commanders from being 
liable for TDY costs without reimbursement. This course of action will be for last minute, 
mission essential additions to the DRMD and will not be used as a work around for failing 
to plan appropriately. (T-2) Force requirement and funding validation stipulations still 
apply. 
3.4.11.3.  CED orders should be the primary orders method for CCDR/CJCS exercise 
participation, however, DTS authorizations may be issued in extenuating circumstances or 
for late/emerging requirements. 
3.4.12.  Exercise DCAPES taskings and CED Orders. CED orders are required for 
contingencies and CJCS exercises. (T-0) The MAJCOM exercise planner may decide to utilize 
CED orders for SecAF or C-MAJCOM/C-NAF sponsored CCMD service component 
exercises on a case-by-case basis. Refer to DAFI 36-3802, Force Support Readiness Programs 
and AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty/Special Orders, for further guidance. 
3.4.12.1.  DCAPES is the system principally used for SecDef ordered deploying forces 
which often creates ambiguity with taskings for non-SDOB directed exercises. Unit 
commanders and deployment managers should determine if DCAPES taskings are 
operational, ordered, or merely a request for volunteers. 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
23 
3.4.12.2.  Certain exercises, though rare, are ordered by the SecDef for unassigned/service 
retained forces to participate with CCDR assigned forces and require full global force 
management allocation for the length of the exercise. During such exercises, forces are 
allocated to a CCDR, and operational control and tactical control authority is exercised 
over those forces. The SecDef will specify the command relationship that the gaining 
commander will exercise (and the losing commander will relinquish). During SecDef 
ordered exercises, CED orders are legal orders from SecDef. These types of taskings are 
compulsory. 
3.4.12.3.  Unit commanders should assess whether to participate in an exercise based on 
unit readiness and shall elevate non-participation requests through their chain of command 
to their parent MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM and NAF/C-NAF for coordination. (T- 2) A 
decision to participate in a CCDR or service component exercise that reduces or does not 
enhance unit readiness should be made only in specific circumstances. These 
circumstances include CCMD assigned forces meeting priority CCDR objectives such as 
building partnership capacity to secure access, basing and overflight, and multi-national 
interoperability training to maintain readiness for regional contingencies. 
3.5.  Exercise Execution.  The formal execution phase begins with deployment of exercise 
participants and continues until end of exercise (ENDEX). 
3.5.1.  Communication and Testing for Exercise Execution. Communication setup and testing 
are important exercise preparation steps prior to the start of execution and should include 
validation of all certifications, accreditations, and authority to operate. End-to-end 
communications checks, and systems interoperability verification are critical to ensure 
connectivity for all live and synthetic exercise entities. 
3.5.2.  OTI Requirements. Exercises require most, if not all, of the elements of OTI that must 
be coordinated, scheduled, and optimized for realistic and relevant operational training. The 
elements of OTI include training systems/simulators, ranges, airspace, aggressors, threat 
generators, embedded training capability, pods/instrumentation, secure networks, and 
enterprise support. 
3.5.3.  Exercise Participant Materials. One of the goals of the exercise program is to practice, 
validate, and reinforce established systems, processes and TTPs. To help support this goal, 
whenever possible, exercise information should be communicated using established systems 
and procedures. Exercise-specific participant materials should only be created when normal 
communication tools or TTPs do not exist to provide required exercise information. Exercise 
participant material should not include trusted agent information or divulge any event 
information before the scheduled time of the event. 
3.5.4.  Exercise Control. Exercise execution is managed by controllers who are knowledgeable 
in the timing and content of exercise events. Controllers manage the direction, pace, and 
intensity of exercise play in accordance with the exercise control plan established by the 
exercise sponsoring organization. USAF planners should determine the number and location 
of control elements and the exercise control procedures needed to provide overall exercise 
management and support the accomplishment of USAF objectives. Planners should prepare 
and provide exercise controllers the support materials needed to manage exercise execution.  
 
 
24 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
When required, a joint exercise control group (JECG) will oversee and manage the exercise 
activity of participants. The JECG will not include exercise players, will be tailored to support 
the size and scope of the exercise, and meet the exercise needs of participating USAF 
organizations. 
3.5.5.  JECG Cell. Since all organizations do not participate in every exercise, JECG, or “White 
Cell,” personnel will replicate the actions or inputs of non-participating organizations that are 
needed to keep exercise activities on track. JECG personnel will not be exercise players but 
will be trusted agents. JECG personnel may also perform controller functions as required. 
3.5.6.  Trusted Agents. Trusted agents are subject matter experts who are given advance 
knowledge of exercise scenario details for the purpose of assisting with all phases of the 
exercise from requirements development to execution. 
3.5.6.1.  To maintain the integrity of exercise information, organizations should limit the 
number of trusted agents to the absolute minimum required to support proper planning. 
3.5.6.2.  To maintain exercise planning continuity, trusted agents should be capable of 
serving from the start of exercise planning through execution. 
3.5.6.3.  Trusted agents should not be principal players during exercise execution since 
advance knowledge of exercise events can significantly decrease the benefit players receive 
from an exercise. 
3.5.6.4.  As a minimum, trusted agent information is Need-to-Know/Controlled 
Unclassified Information and should remain close-hold within the exercise planning 
community. Exercise information should not be released outside the planning community 
without the approval of the primary planning staff of the sponsoring organization for an 
exercise. 
3.5.6.5.  Trusted agents from participating USAF organizations will review the MSEL and 
ensure planned events support USAF objectives. (T-3) 
3.5.7.  Observers. Observers are a vital link in the exercise process. They ensure exercise 
objectives are met, provide on-the-spot instruction and capture observations and/or best 
practices for the after-action report and inclusion in the JLLIS. They can also recommend and 
coordinate event changes when required during exercise execution. All observers, to include 
USAF, joint and coalition/multi-national partners, shall have appropriate security clearance 
and need to know before being authorized to participate in an exercise. (T-1) 
3.5.8.  Exercise Reporting. Exercises provide an opportunity to practice procedures and 
evaluate their effectiveness. All exercise participants, to include observers and controllers, 
should note strengths and weaknesses encountered in any area during exercise planning or 
execution and identify these using the prescribed L2 and after actions processes. 
3.6.  Exercise Assessment.  An exercise/training assessment is the analytical process used by 
commanders to determine an organizations proficiency to accomplish the capability requirements 
defined in the METs. The assessment phase provides the commander a clear structure to identify 
strengths and weaknesses, review issues, and lessons learned, and assess the ability of an 
organizations training program, provide guidance, mitigate risks, and reprioritize resources. 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
25 
3.6.1.  AARs. Participating USAF organizations should develop an AAR that summarizes 
exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and makes 
recommendations. 
3.6.2.  Participating USAF organizations will follow the guidance in AFI 10-1302, Air Force 
Lessons Learned Program, for posting and forwarding AARs. (T-3) 
3.6.3.  Commanders at all levels will ensure exercise readiness outcomes are accurately 
reflected in DRRS. (T-2) 
3.6.4.  MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs, NGB and the ECWG will review DRRS 
exercise readiness assessments, OTI metrics, performance-based measures, L2 and AARs to 
inform the next FY’s exercise priorities. Additionally, to drive future Warfighter requirements, 
identified gaps should inform applicable offices and/or forums (requirements office, 
WEPTAC, JROC, etc.) 
3.6.5.  Lessons Learned (L2). The Air Force Office of Lessons Learned (LeMay Center) is the 
OPR for the Air Force Lessons Learned Process. JLLIS (https://www.jllis.mil/apps/) is the 
USAF system of record for the management of all Air Force observations, L2, and AARs. 
3.7.  AFFORGEN.  Air Force Force Generation (AFFORGEN) is the Air Force’s sustainable, 
capacity‐driven model for presenting forces to joint force commanders. AFFORGEN’s intent is to 
enable operational preparedness and readiness recovery to compete with peer competitors, while 
clearly focusing USAF efforts on a predictable and sustainable force offering. Figure 3.2 depicts 
the AFFORGEN model. AFFORGEN provides leadership with improved visibility into force 
readiness, which results in faster, smarter, and more accurate decision making. 
3.7.1.  AFFORGEN Phases. Active duty AFFORGEN establishes a 24‐month rotational cycle 
with 6‐month phases. There are four rotational phases of readiness in the AFFORGEN cycle: 
RESET (for reintegration and reconstitution), PREPARE (for training towards peak readiness), 
CERTIFY (for certification), and AVAILABLE (for deployment). 
3.7.2.  AFFORGEN Implementation. All MAJCOMs will align their forces into the 
AFFORGEN model. USAF will present, generate, and employ airpower in the AFFORGEN 
model, as well as critical implementation dates, and employment scenarios. Exercise planners 
will comply with AFFORGEN implementation orders for designated events. (T-1) 
3.7.3.  AFFORGEN Alignment. Force elements in the RESET and PREPARE phases should 
focus on development and validation of competencies at the force element-and-below level, 
while those in the CERTIFY phase center on integration with other force elements and 
joint/coalition partners. 
3.7.4.  RESET Phase. Unit and individual level training is the primary focus during the RESET 
phase. Home station squadrons are responsible for resourcing and coordinating assigned unit 
type code (UTC) and individual training events necessary to build toward higher level, multi-
unit training. 
 
 
26 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
3.7.5.  PREPARE Phase. Multi-unit, full-spectrum level training is the primary focus during 
the prepare phase. Home station wings are responsible for resourcing and coordinating 
assigned UTCs to provide mutually supportive training of multidisciplinary elements to 
achieve necessary task skillsets. This level of training inherently involves elements and 
skillsets found among multiple UTCs from associated force elements, but beyond a squadron’s 
capacity to resource. Wings should attempt to match UTCs associated to the same 
AFFORGEN force elements to support training events. PREPARE phase activities may 
integrate continued basic unit and upgrade training activities as required to meet MAJCOM 
requirements. 
3.7.6.  CERTIFY Phase. Expeditionary air bases  and corresponding forces elements (mission 
generation/demand force teams) conducting high-fidelity joint training are the primary focus 
during the CERTIFY phase. MAJCOMs will be responsible for resourcing and coordinating 
assigned force elements to provide agile combat employment (ACE)-capable force packages. 
MAJCOMs must resource necessary training events to achieve force element certification 
standards. Force providers should coordinate with C-MAJCOMs to provide appropriate 
training opportunities to achieve applicable force element certification standards. To achieve 
theater- or mission-specific requirements, C-MAJCOMs should source force elements that are 
most likely to be allocated to their supported CCMDs. CERTIFY phase activities may integrate 
continued basic unit, upgrade, and full-spectrum training as required to meet MAJCOM 
requirements. 
3.7.7.  AVAILABLE TO COMMIT Phase. Unit is deployed, or ready to go at a moment’s 
notice for things such as short-notice task force or dynamic force employment deployments. 
3.7.8.  AFFORGEN Responsibility. Alignment of units to exercises based on AFFORGEN 
model posture is the responsibility of the MAJCOMs and will be reviewed during the ECWG. 
MAJCOMs will refer to AFFORGEN policy documents as the primary guidance when 
aligning units to exercises found at https://tmis.us.af.mil/afforgenconnect.

Chapter 4 
USAF EXERCISE PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES 
4.1.  CEP/JEP Exercises. 
4.1.1.  Concept. Exercises should embody a “train the way we fight” philosophy and should 
exercise actual command relationships as much as possible. Exercises should provide 
opportunities to assess real-world capabilities consistent with safety, security, and the exercise 
objectives. When appropriate, exercises should also incorporate other requirements, such as 
logistics, support, force protection, and the ability to operate in a degraded/contaminated 
environment, including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments. 
Whenever possible, exercises should seek to employ and evaluate current or proposed plans, 
policies, procedures, processes, and doctrine. 
4.1.2.  Per CJCSI 3500.01J, units will record assessments for CE2 exercise in JTIMS. (T-0) 
The Inspector General and inspecting organizations will only officially grade inspected units 
during exercises, provided graded events are clearly identified to all exercise participants. 
(T- 0) 
4.1.3.  To take advantage of the synergy that exists when exercises require similar skill sets 
and have common venues, scenarios, and objectives, MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C- 
NAFs, and NGB should consider linking their sponsored exercises with CJCS, CCDR or 
service exercises whenever possible. The ECWG should look for these opportunities to link 
exercises in an effort to maximize joint training opportunities with finite resources. 
4.1.4.  Scheduling. Participating in CEP and JEP exercises and also supporting USAF-
conducted exercises places considerable stress on USAF units and often strains available 
assets. Unit commanders shall reference DRRS to determine their ability to support all exercise 
requirements as they develop their exercise schedules and make exercise commitments. (T- 3) 
4.2.  NEP Exercises. 
4.2.1.  The NEP is managed by the Department of Homeland Security and provides a 
framework for prioritizing and focusing federal exercise activities. 
4.2.1.1.  The Department of the Air Force, as a DoD Component, will support the NEP in 
accordance with DoDI 3020.47, DoD Participation in the National Exercise Program 
(NEP). (T-0) 
4.2.1.2.  National Exercise Program Capstone Event. The National Exercise Program 
capstone event is the single biennial operations-based NEP exercise (occurring on even 
years) and requires the participation of all appropriate department and agency principals. 
4.2.1.3.  The CJCS serves as the DoD POC to the NEP and orchestrates overall DoD NEP 
execution. 
4.2.2.  Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) accredited service and U.S. Special 
Operations Command (USSOCOM) events are included in the service portion of JTEEP 
program. 
28 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
4.3.  Nuclear Exercises. 
4.3.1.  MAJCOM commanders are responsible to ensure MAJCOM nuclear exercises are 
conducted properly IAW AFI 13-550, Air Force Nuclear Command, Control, and 
Communications (NC3). (T-1) MAJCOM commanders are the waiver approval authority, 
unless delegated to the deputy commander, for movement/cancellation of scheduled nuclear 
exercises which are MAJCOM directed. 
4.3.2.  NAF commanders are responsible to ensure NAF nuclear exercises are conducted 
properly IAW AFI 13-550. (T-2) NAF commanders are the waiver approval authority, unless 
delegated to the Deputy NAF commanders, for movement/cancellation of scheduled nuclear 
exercises which are MAJCOM directed or higher. 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023

Chapter 5 
EXERCISE FUNDING 
5.1.  General Information.  MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs and NGB fund the 
respective exercises they program, manage, and execute. International participation in USAF 
hosted exercises is funded through a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case reimbursing the USAF for 
all goods and services consumed during the exercise period. 
5.1.1.  As noted in Chapter 2, MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs and NGB exercise 
program managers will sync their funding process timelines with the JTEEP funding process 
timelines outlined in CJCSM 3511.01A. (T-1) The intent is to base funding decisions educated 
by outputs from the JTS Four Phase Process and sync up with the joint training planning cycle. 
5.1.2.  The primary sourcing for joint training is the JTEEP program. As such, the JTEEP 
account funds USAF participation in JEP exercises. The CE2 account is programmed and 
managed by the JS/J7 with oversight by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Personnel & Readiness (OUSD (P&R)). 
5.1.3.  Exercise funding and programming actions occur within the DoD Planning, 
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. 
5.1.4.  In addition to Air Staff PPBE policy and guidance, USAF organizations will comply 
with the JEP provisions in CJCSM 3511.01A and published JTEEP Program Goals & 
Objectives. 
5.1.5.  All level 1,2, and 3 exercises requiring M&S support are designated as USAF M&S 
efforts and the Chief Modeling and Simulation Office will work with the MAJCOMs to ensure 
adequate funding where applicable. 
5.2.  JTEEP Program Account. 
5.2.1.  The JTEEP account provides funds for the following types of exercise activities: 
5.2.1.1.  Incremental Expenses. JTEEP provides SIF to pay for the incremental operations 
and maintenance activities incurred solely for, or as a direct result of, planning for or taking 
part in a CE2-funded exercise. Information on use of SIF and valid incremental activities 
is outlined in CJCSM 3511.01A. 
5.2.1.2.  Transportation. The CE2 Joint Exercise Transportation Program (JETP) includes 
funding for airlift, sealift, port handling (PH), inland transportation (IT), and the CTP. 
Active Component, AFR and ANG forces can receive CE2 JETP funds. Follow direction 
and guidance in CJCSM 3511.01A for use of JETP and PH, IT and CTP funding. 
5.2.2.  Operational Training and Infrastructure Division (AF/A3TI) is responsible for 
managing the disbursement of CE2 funds associated with USAF participation in JEP exercises. 
5.2.2.1.  Funding for JEP exercises is based on requirements identified in JTIMS. Exercise 
sponsors and planners should ensure the accurate and timely entry of required JTIMS data. 
Funding may be denied if the requirements are not entered and processed through JTIMS. 
 
 
30 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
5.2.2.2.  AF/A3T will use Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) hierarchy codes to track CE2 
expenditures by exercise. To facilitate exercise expenditure accounting, USAF 
organizations will ensure that all exercise lines of accounting contain the proper DAI 
project/task code. (T-1) 
5.3.  CE2 Funds Management. 
5.3.1.  PH/IT Funds. 
5.3.1.1.  MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAF/C-NAFs, and NGB will manage the obligation 
and distribution of PH/IT funds. (T-1) 
5.3.1.2.  Transportation Account Codes (TAC). MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C- 
NAFs and NGB should use TACs to fund PH/IT requirements whenever possible. When a 
TAC is not viable, MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs will receive PH/IT 
funding per paragraph 5.2.1.2. (T-1) 
5.3.1.3.  JS/J7 Program Management Activities (PMA) distributes PH/IT funds in 
accordance with CCMD Spend Plans. MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs are 
still responsible for getting funds to the appropriate units and for tracking PH/IT obligations 
by exercise name and DAI code. 
5.3.2.  CTP Funds. 
5.3.2.1.  MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs manage the obligation and distribution of CTP funds. 
5.3.2.2.  Funding Request. MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs need to submit 
their CTP requests in accordance with JS/J7 Joint Exercise Transportation Program, 
Commercial Ticket Program Implementation Guidance. JS/J7 processes CTP requests and 
distributes CTP funds in accordance with JS/J7 Joint Exercise Transportation Program, 
Commercial Ticket Program Implementation Guidance. 
5.3.3.  SIF Funds. 
5.3.3.1.  AF/A3TI oversees the distribution of SIF funds and MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs 
manage the obligation of SIF funds. 
5.3.3.2.  Funding Request. MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs will follow SIF Business Rules. 
(T-1) 
5.3.4.  CE2 funds are authorized to support specific approved exercise expenses and may not 
be redirected to fund any other activities. MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs must 
track PH/IT, CTP, and SIF obligations separately. (T-1) 
5.4.  Exercise Funding Process. 
5.4.1.  JEP exercises. 
5.4.1.1.  AF/A3T is the USAF OPR for managing CE2-supplied funding. 
5.4.1.2.  All USAF organizations will comply with CJCS exercise funding guidance in 
Enclosure B, CJCSM3511.01A and Chapter 1, DAFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance 
and Procedures. (T-1) 
 
 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
31 
5.4.2.  Non-JEP exercises. USAF organizations conducting unilateral or other joint exercises 
not within the approved JEP fund these exercises from their own operations and maintenance 
accounts. For USAF- conducted non-JEP exercises, the MAJCOM or USAF organization 
sponsoring an exercise is generally responsible for funding the exercise. 
5.4.3.  Combined exercises. Combined exercises should have a written arrangement with the 
foreign participant(s) that includes the scope of the exercise, status of U.S. personnel 
(paragraph 3.4.8), and funding procedures, as appropriate. Any U.S. training, supplies, or 
other services provided to participating countries should be provided pursuant to the relevant 
legal authority, such as a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case or cross-servicing agreement 
under Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authority. 
5.5.  Air Staff PPBE Process for Service Incremental Funding (SIF). 
5.5.1.  During the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development process, 
MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs submit their Future Years Defense Plan SIF 
requirements for JEP exercises to AF/A3T. 
5.5.1.1.  AF/A3TI consolidates USAF requirements and submits the USAF SIF request to 
JS/J7. 
5.5.1.2.  JS/J7 incorporates USAF SIF requirements into the overall DoD-wide CE2 
request as part of the President’s Budget. 
5.5.2.  The Department of Defense Appropriations Act establishes the amount of CE2 funds 
that are appropriated for the upcoming execution year. Once Congress enacts, and the President 
signs the annual DoD Appropriations Act, funds are available for execution. If the annual DoD 
Appropriations Act is not signed before the beginning of the execution year, Congress may 
provide funding under a continuing resolution. 
5.5.3.  JS/J7 determines USAF SIF funding for the current execution year and publishes this 
information as part of the CE2 Program Execution Plan (PEP). Once the USAF SIF allocation 
is known, AF/A3TI will provide execution year fiscal guidance to USAF MAJCOMs/C-
MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs. 
5.5.3.1.  If a MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM, NAF/C-NAF and NGB encounters an unanticipated 
SIF requirement during the current fiscal year, notify AF/A3TI of the requirement. The 
notification should include sufficient explanation to justify a request for additional funds. 
If AF/A3TI cannot fund the requirement from existing USAF SIF resources, when deemed 
appropriate, they will submit an unfunded requirement to the JS for additional funds from 
the CE2 Program. 
5.5.3.2.  AF/A3TI will only authorize USAF SIF to fund valid JEP exercise activities. 
MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs should notify appropriate CCMD staff in 
addition to AF/A3TI when they have excess SIF funds. Ultimately, SIF funds not needed 
to support USAF requirements revert back to JS/J7 control for reallocation against other 
CE2 program requirements. 
 
 
32 
AFI10-204  6 SEPTEMBER 2023 
5.6.  Tracking and Reporting. 
5.6.1.  PH/IT and CTP funds are distributed per the procedures in paragraphs 5.3.1.3 and 
5.3.2.2 respectively. SIF funds are distributed per AF/A3TI-issued fiscal guidance. 
MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs will track all JEP expenditures using assigned 
emergency and special program codes. Questions concerning the use of DAI Task Number 
should be addressed to AF/A3TI. 
5.6.2.  MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs and NAFs/C-NAFs will submit monthly SIF obligation 
reports to AF/A3TI by the third working day of the following month. AF/A3TI will submit a 
consolidated obligation report to JS/J7 within the first week of the month following the report 
month. 
5.7.  Funding and Operations for Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft and use of Foreign 
Tankers during Combined Exercises. 
5.7.1.  USAF tankers flying aerial refueling missions to exclusively support USAF aircraft 
during combined exercises can also refuel foreign aircraft on the same mission. Guidance on 
refueling missions is provided in AFI 16-115, Managing International Participation in Flying 
Exercises, and AFI 25-301, Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements, if an ACSA exists. 
Foreign governments are billed for off-loaded fuel if the refueling occurs during the scheduled 
exercise period. If the refueling mission occurs outside the scheduled exercise period, the 
foreign government may be billed for the extended flying hours. This provision only applies 
to planned combined exercises and not daily training or FMS refueling requests from foreign 
partners. 
5.7.2.  International receiver pilots and commercial and international tanker crews 
participating in aerial refueling operations during exercise missions involving USAF tankers 
or receivers must be qualified in and use USAF aerial refueling terminology and procedures as 
specified in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)- 
56(B), Air-to-Air Refueling. (T-0)

Attachment 2 
EXERCISE COORDINATION WORKING GROUP (ECWG) 
A2.1.  Overview.  This attachment outlines the organization and functions of the ECWG. The 
ACC/A3O Division Chief chairs the ECWG with the authority to coordinate USAF forces support 
for CCMD, CJCS, SecAF and joint service exercises. 
A2.2.  Objective.  The ECWG is an action officer-level working group that meets at the start of 
the MAJCOMs’ exercise scheduling build timeline approximately 8 months prior to the start of 
the next FY. The ECWG is the capstone forum for MAJCOM exercise POCs to discuss topics of 
interest pertaining to exercise support for SecAF, CCDR, CJCS, and joint service training events. 
Its primary purpose is to review and prioritize the annual USAF MEC. The MEC is derived from 
JTIMS, CPS and other MAJCOM scheduling tools. Working group members will identify 
scheduling conflicts which could potentially lead to sourcing and funding shortfalls for major 
events and develop plans of action to mitigate the issue. The working group will also identify 
exercises that can meet JADC2 objectives and exercises with similar objectives that can be 
combined or SecAF exercises that can be linked to JEP, CCMD, or other service events to 
maximize joint interoperability training. 
A2.3.  Organization and Function. 
A2.3.1.  The ECWG is comprised of exercise planners, schedulers and support staff from the 
member organizations listed in paragraph A2.3.4. Participation in the ECWG is unit funded; 
therefore, organizations should account for travel expenses during respective POM and 
execution year planning. 
A2.3.2.  The ECWG provides a forum in which exercise planners/schedulers across the USAF 
can gather to discuss exercise related issues. The ECWG provides an opportunity to share the 
latest developments in the exercise enterprise and the status of exercise funding, both current 
and future forecasts. In addition, it gives stakeholders an opportunity to discuss organization 
specific problems or concerns that affect the working group. 
A2.3.3.  The ECWG follows an input to output model. The input is the USAF exercise demand 
from all stakeholders per JTIMS inputs along with readiness gaps and request for exercise 
support and asset participation. The output is a prioritized list of exercises USAF forces may 
support based on the force structure available in accordance with the AFFFORGEN model, 
after accounting for mandated tasks such as SecDef ordered deployments, and CCMD CSP 
missions. The ECWG will review C-MAJCOM and C-NAF CCDR exercise obligations, 
MAJCOM commander readiness objectives, SecAF Exercise Decision Matrix in Figure 1.1 
and AF/A3 guidance to develop priorities. The force structure available is a forecasted capacity 
for the FY of execution after removing mandated tasks such as deployments in response to 
SecDef allocation/transfer, and CCDR CSP missions. 
A2.3.4.  Membership. The following organizations will have representatives on the ECWG.

A2.4.  Master Exercise Calendar (MEC) Development Process. 
A2.4.1.  Maintaining a USAF exercise enterprise schedule is a crucial component of exercise 
oversight. USAF senior leaders and commanders at all levels need a common and easily 
accessible MEC to aid in training and readiness assessments. The ECWG is the forum for 
MAJCOMs/C-MAJCOMs, NAFs/C-NAFs and NGB to codify readiness training requirements 
and ensure the most accurate data is available to populate the MEC. The MEC contains data 
from several sources to include JTIMS, Magellan, Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS) and 
other scheduling tools. 
A2.4.2.  The development of an USAF MEC begins approximately 12-14 months from FY 
execution. The following describes the steps and approximate timeline for completion; exact 
timing and battle rhythm will be established by the ECWG chair: 
A2.4.3.  12-14 months (prior to FY execution): “Call for Requirements” memo released. 
Stakeholders will enter all their exercises requiring external resources (e.g., Personnel, aircraft, 
funds, man-days etc.) into JTIMS in order to be prioritized. 
A2.4.4.  10-12 months: Exercise submission window closes, AF/A3TI consolidates inputs and 
updates the MEC using source data from JTIMS, Magellan, CPS, and other MAJCOM 
scheduling tools. Using the Exercise Decision Matrix discussed in paragraphs 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, 
a prioritized list of service and CCMD exercises is developed. Potential date conflicts between 
major events requiring resources will be identified, to be discussed during the ECWG meeting. 
A2.4.5.  10 months: ECWG meeting commences. Stakeholders review the calendar and 
formulate courses of action to mitigate scheduling and resource conflicts/shortfalls. The 
ultimate goal is to reach consensus among the ECWG members regarding the accuracy of the 
prioritized MEC, in preparation for MAJCOM, C-MAJCOM and NGB A3 coordination and 
approval. Once the ECWG reaches consensus on the exercise schedule, the MEC will be 
updated to include the specific USAF units that are participating. 
A2.4.6.  9-10 months: The ECWG-approved calendar is staffed by AF/A3T for topline 
coordination and signature by MAJCOM, C-MAJCOM and NGB deputy commanders. AF/A3 
is the final approval authority once coordination is completed among the stakeholders. 
A2.4.7.  The MEC will provide a common operating picture for both senior leaders and 
operational units. An accurate calendar will enable: 
A2.4.7.1.  Senior leader visibility on the USAF exercise enterprise. 
A2.4.7.2.  MAJCOM exercise planners to quickly assess the level of effort across multiple 
unit levels and time periods. 
A2.4.7.3.  MAJCOM exercise planners to align exercise participation to readiness goals. 
A2.4.7.4.  An agreed upon prioritization of exercises to optimize the use of airlift and air- 
refueling assets and other high demand/low density assets. 
A2.4.7.5.  ECWG to visualize the USAF and joint exercise demand to seek opportunities 
to link or combine events while still meeting specific weapon systems and JADC2 
readiness requirements.
