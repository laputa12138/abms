SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This manual has been completely revised and rewritten and must be completely reviewed due to 
numerous operational changes.  This revision addresses the changes resulting from the stand-up 
of Air National Guard Air Defense Squadrons.  It updates terminology to align with AFI 13-1 
Vol.  2, Ground Command and Control Systems Standardization/Evaluation Program-
Organization and Administration.  It expands and clarifies the instructor training program, 
addresses the Emergency Action Coordinator as a complementary certification within the Battle 
Control Centers (BCCs), and updates training reports and the use of electronic records 
management data.  It reflects the transition of PACAF units in Korea and Japan to the Air Battle 
Manager Qualification, with its accompanying certifications.  Waiver authorities have been 
changed to reflect guidance in AFI 33-360.

Chapter 1 
OVERVIEW AND CONCEPTS 
1.1.  General.  This manual provides guidance for the fixed tactical Battle Management 
Command and Control (BMC2) units within the Continental United States and Pacific Air 
Forces (PACAF) to include the 169th Air Defense Squadron (ADS) and 176th ADS.  This 
manual applies to Air National Guard (ANG) units employing the Battle Control Center (BCC).  
It also applies to PACAF units that operate fixed tactical BMC2 platforms at locations in Japan 
and Korea (610th Air Control Flight (ACF), 623d Air Control Squadron (ACS) and 621 ACS).  
Throughout this manual, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 13B refers to Air Battle Managers 
(ABM), AFSC 1C5X1D refers to Weapons Directors (WD), and AFSC 1C5X1 refers to 
Command and Control Battle Management Operators (all include Canadian equivalents). 
1.2.  Purpose.  This manual establishes the minimum training requirements to ensure operations 
personnel are adequately trained during Initial Qualification Training (IQT), Mission 
Qualification Training (MQT) and Continuation Training (CT).  The lack of a dedicated Formal 
Training Unit for these operational units, necessitates that IQT be conducted on the operational 
mission system.  As such, the training activities are integrated into the operational equipment 
suite.  To make the most effective use of positional training, IQT and MQT are fully integrated.  
Trainees must meet the following Combat Mission Ready (CMR) requirements: 
1.2.1.  Complete an Air Education and Training Command (AETC) approved formal training 
course (AFSC Award) (T-2). 
1.2.2.  Complete IQT/MQT.  Successful completion of an Initial Qualification (INIT 
QUAL)/Mission Qualification (MSN) evaluation in accordance with  AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL 
Vol.  2 is the event that marks completion of IQT/MQT (T-2). 
1.3.  Unit Recommendations for Change.

training (IQT/MQT) requirements, individuals are released to STAN/EVAL for evaluation.  
STAN/EVAL awards a qualification in accordance with AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol.  2.  The 
qualification statuses are Combat Mission Ready (CMR) and Basic Mission Capable (BMC). 
1.5.1.  Upon successful completion of the Initial Qualification/Mission evaluation, 
crewmembers are designated as CMR or BMC. 
10 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
1.5.1.1.  Combat Mission Ready (CMR).  CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency in all 
core missions of the unit, accomplishing the required training in all of the mission tasks 
for their duty position. 
1.5.1.2.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  BMC is a status conferred on MAJCOM, NAF, 
and attached personnel whose primary duties do not allow them to maintain CMR status 
(i.e., lookback and CT requirements).  BMC crewmembers can be used to provide 
additional mission generation/combat capability.  Unit/CC’s designate personnel as BMC 
in writing. 
1.5.1.2.1.  Commander approval is required for unsupervised mission participation by 
BMC crewmembers. 
1.5.1.2.2.  BMC crewmembers are exempt from academic training and/or special 
training programs except where specifically directed by the host unit. 
1.5.2.  Attached Personnel.  ACC Combat Integration Branch (A3CI) (PACAF/A310 for 
PACAF units) determines/approves attached personnel requirements for personnel assigned 
above NAF level.  Attached crewmembers will have a valid AF Form 8, Certificate of 
Aircrew Qualification in accordance with AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol.  2 (T-2). 
1.5.3.  Unqualified (UQ).  Crew members will be designated UQ for the following: 
1.5.3.1.  Downgraded for being non-CMR/non-BMC (NCMR/NBMC) longer than 6 
months (T-3). 
1.5.3.2.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability (T-3). 
1.5.3.3.  Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a periodic evaluation, failure to 
complete an evaluation by the expiration date, or at the commander’s discretion 
following a commander-directed downgrade in accordance with AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL 
Vol.  2.  (T-3). 
1.5.4.  Crewmember Experience Level.  Crewmember experience levels indicate to unit/CCs 
how much training crewmembers need to maintain CT requirements and proficiency.  The 
unit DO designates all crewmembers as “Inexperienced” or “Experienced” after meeting the 
criteria below.  The Chief of Training (COT) documents experience levels in accordance 
with Chapter 6. 
1.5.4.1.  An experienced Air Battle Manager (ABM), Air Weapons Officer (AWO), or 
Weapons Director (WD): 
1.5.4.1.1.  Has 1 year in the AFSC after award (T-3). 
1.5.4.1.2.  Performed as a CMR/BMC ABM, AWO or WD for a minimum of 6 
months (3 months for 621 ACS) on the unit’s assigned system of record (T-3). 
1.5.4.1.3.  Has at least 50 controlled events (live/virtual/constructive (L/V/C)) in a 
CMR/BMC status, of which a minimum of 25 must be on the unit’s assigned system 
of record (T-3).  For AFSC 13Bs, Senior Director (SD) and AWO CMR events from 
previous units can count toward controlled events.  Due to shortened assignment 
timelines, the 621 ACS/CC may waive system of record minimums. 
1.5.4.2.  An experienced crewmember (all other duty positions): 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
11 
1.5.4.2.1.  Has been formally awarded a AFSC 13BXX/1C5X1 AFSC (T-2). 
1.5.4.2.2.  Has 1 year in the AFSC after award (T-3). 
1.5.4.2.3.  Performed in the duty position for a minimum of 6 months (3 months for 
621 ACS) on the unit’s assigned system of record (T-3). 
1.5.4.2.4.  Has at least 50 career event operations (L/V/C) performing duties in the 
corresponding qualification, of which a minimum of 25 must be on the unit’s 
assigned system of record (T-3).  Due to shortened assignment timelines, the 621 
ACS/CC may waive system of record minimums for assigned personnel. 
1.5.5.  Upgrade/Specialized Training.  Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any special 
skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required of every 
crewmember.  Upgrade/Specialized training is normally accomplished after a crewmember is 
assigned CMR/BMC status and is in addition to CMR/BMC requirements.  Unless otherwise 
specified, CMR/BMC crewmembers may hold special certifications/qualifications as long as 
they meet all additional training requirements.  (See Chapter 4)  Crewmembers upgrading to 
Instructor maintain CMR status in their duty position.  Instructors may perform instructor 
duties in accordance with the Instructor Syllabus.  Instructors who become Non-CMR 
(NCMR) require unit/CC approval to continue academic and/or positional instructor duties. 
1.6.  Training Concepts and Guidance. 
1.6.1.  Training programs are designed to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness 
consistent with flight safety and resource availability.  Training balances the need for realism 
against the expected threat, crew capabilities, and safety.  This volume provides training 
guidelines to be used with operational procedures specified in other applicable 
flying/operations publications. 
1.6.2.  Training missions are designed to provide unit personnel with the skills to accomplish 
unit mission, roles/capability, maintain proficiency, as well as to enhance safety.  Training 
missions emphasize combat/contingency skills through missions/scenarios that reflect 
procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and 
opposition capabilities.  Units train using procedures and actions applicable to 
combat/contingency scenarios (e.g., ,appropriate use of code words, authentication 
procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, 
threat reactions, intelligence briefings and debriefings). 
1.6.3.  Crewmember Supervision.  The following personnel must be under the direct 
supervision of an instructor/evaluator when performing mission positional duties/tasks. 
1.6.3.1.  Unqualified crewmembers (T-3). 
1.6.3.2.  Crew members performing events in which they are not certified (T-3). 
1.6.3.3.  Crew members performing IQT/MQT (T-3). 
1.6.3.4.  Crew members regressed to NCMR/NBMC (T-3). 
1.6.4.  Medical Clearance. 
12 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
1.6.4.1.  All AFSC 13B ABMs must maintain a medical clearance documented on DD 
Form 2992, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty in 
accordance with AFI 11- 401.  (T-2). 
1.6.4.2.  All AFSC 1C5Ds must maintain a medical clearance documented on DD Form 
2992 in accordance with AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.  (T-2). 
1.6.4.3.  Individuals without a valid medical clearance will not conduct live 
operations/exercises as part of the combat mission crew (T-2); the unit/CC will determine 
what, if any, battle staff functions the individual may perform.  They can accomplish 
virtual/constructive training. (NOTE: virtual/constructive training activities while on 
Duty Not Involving Controlling (DNIC) status count towards CT requirements). 
1.6.5.  The COT may adjust training time or remove personnel from IQT/MQT training due 
to medical disqualification or DNIC status, emergency leave, operational exercises, 
inspections, convalescent leave, work-related TDYs, or administrative action.  An entry 
indicating the adjustment by the COT will be documented in accordance with Chapter 6 (T-
3). 
1.6.6.  Personnel TDY for 30 consecutive days (two Unit Training Assemblies (UTA)) (UTA 
applies to Drill Status Guardsmen) or more to locations where IQT/MQT/CT is available will 
accomplish training (T-3).   
1.6.7.  Individuals not performing duties in the operations section because of disciplinary, 
serious administrative issues, or lack of fitness for duty reasons, will not be entered 
into/continued in training (T-3).  Individuals not performing duties in the operations section 
for reasons of Uniform Code of Military Justice prosecution/conviction, drug abuse, 
conscientious objector status, or loss of security clearance, will not be entered into/continued 
in training (T-2). 
1.7.  Training Requirements. 
1.7.1.  This manual establishes the minimum training requirements used by the COT to 
ensure operations personnel are trained during IQT/MQT and CT in accordance with 
MAJCOM approved training syllabus.  Personnel assigned to units covered under this 
manual have varying backgrounds and different levels of experience and proficiency.  The 
COT ensures review of individuals’ training accomplishments and establishes an appropriate 
course of training based on individual background and experience.  The COT records the 
review on the AF Form 4141, Individual’s Record of Duties and Experience Ground 
Environment Personnel. 
1.7.2.  The total number of training missions/events accomplished is the primary factor for 
maintaining an individual’s qualification status.  A review of the training missions/events 
accomplished also considers specific event types. 
1.7.3.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 
1.7.3.1.  Evaluation of any additional specialized mission training required for CMR (T-
2). 
1.7.3.2.  Meeting 3-month lookback requirements as described in the respective tables in 
Chapter 3, Chapter 7 & Chapter 8 (T-2).

3.5.2.  Contingency Operations.  Contingency operations can have a positive or negative 
impact on a unit's overall CT program, as emphasis is on supporting contingency operations.  
The DO will consider this during unit planning, at the end of the training cycle and prior to 
submitting training cycle waivers.  Additionally, the following proration procedures are 
intended to provide DO’s flexibility in accomplishing their unit's CT program. 
3.5.3.  Crew members that become Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable 
(BMC) after the beginning of the training cycle accomplish a prorated share of existing 
training cycle academic training requirements for the remainder of the period.  Proration 
period starts with the first day of the following month.  Note: Training accomplished during 
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission Qualification Training (MQT) does not count 
toward CT requirements. 
3.5.4.  Round down training requirement events to the next whole number when prorating; 
however, no requirement can be less than one (1). 
3.5.5.  Chapter 6  provides guidance on prorating requirements. 
3.6.  Regression from CMR/BMC Status.  Crewmembers who are regressed to Non-Combat 
Mission Ready/Basic Mission Capable (NCMR/NBMC) status are not authorized to perform 
crew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision. 
3.6.1.  Crew members are regressed to NCMR/NBMC status for one or more of the following 
reasons:

crewmembers will follow paragraph 3.8 guidance (T-3). 
3.6.1.2.  Failure to complete training cycle CT requirements.  To regain CMR/BMC 
status crewmembers will follow paragraph 3.8 guidance (T-3). 
3.6.1.3.  At CC direction.  To regain CMR/BMC status crewmembers are to complete an 
approved training plan (T-3). 
3.6.2.  Lookback.  Lookback is a management tool used to determine and monitor CMR 
crewmember proficiency during the training cycle.  A lookback flow chart is located at 
Attachment 3.  A crewmember’s lookback requirements are based on the crewmember’s 
experience status at the end of the lookback period.  Lookback requirements are outlined in 
Table 3.1 
3.6.2.1.  Lookback does not apply to BMC crewmembers. 
3.6.2.2.  DNIC 
crewmembers’ 
training 
accomplishments 
in 
virtual/constructive 
environments count towards lookback requirements. 
3.6.2.3.  Lookback calculations are based on the previous 3-months (T-3).  Example: 
Senior Airman (SRA) Jones (an inexperienced WD) participated in two control events in 
June and one control event in July.  If SRA Jones had a 3-month lookback requirement of 
eight control events, he/she would need to participate in five control events during the 
month of August in order to stay CMR. 
3.6.2.4.  The COT will submit the 3-month lookback report by the fifth duty day of the 
new month (T-3). 
22 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
3.6.2.5.  Lookback computations for newly qualified crewmembers begin following 
completion of Initial Qualification/Mission (INIT QUAL/MSN) evaluation, as applicable, 
and three full months of CMR status.  Computation for crewmembers restored to CMR 
status will start the month following return to CMR status (T-3). 
3.6.2.6.  If a CMR crewmember fails to meet the 3-month lookback requirement, the 
unit/CC may: 
3.6.2.6.1.  Regress the individual to NCMR status (T-3). 
3.6.2.6.2.  Remove the individual from the CMR position (T-3). 
3.6.2.6.3.  Place the crewmember in probation status for 1 month (T-3).  If the 
commander chooses probation, the crewmember is required to reestablish a 3- month 
lookback by the end of the probation period to remain CMR.  Example: SRA Jones 
(an inexperienced WD) participated in one control event in June, two control events 
in July, and three control events in August.  In this example, SRA Jones did not meet 
the requirement of eight control events for an inexperienced WD.  With a 
commander-approved probationary period, SRA Jones must complete three control 
events in September in order to remain CMR after his/her probation period expires.  
The completion of these control events would reestablish SRA Jones’s lookback and 
prevent him/her from becoming NCMR. 
3.6.2.7.  Document all actions in accordance with Chapter 6 (T-3). 
3.6.2.8.  Crewmembers that regress to NCMR status for less than 6 months (seven UTAs) 
will complete training consisting (as a minimum) of the following before returning to 
CMR status (T-3). 
3.6.2.8.1.  Conduct a minimum of one effective control event, link event, and/or event 
operation, applicable to the duty position while monitored by an instructor (T-3).  The 
event may be live, virtual, or constructive. 
3.6.2.8.2.  Upon completion of the training and instructor recommendation, the 
commander returns the individual to CMR status (T-3).   
3.6.2.8.3.  Events accomplished during the training count toward a crewmember’s CT 
requirements. 
3.6.2.9.  If a crewmember is NCMR for more than 6 months, (seven UTAs) downgrade 
the individual to Unqualified (UQ) status and enter into requalification training with 
subsequent requalification evaluation (T-3).

6.3.3.  AF Form 8.  STAN/EVAL form used to record evaluations; however, the COT uses it 
to certify completion of any additional training requirements that result from evaluations.  
The instructor completing the additional training (or last training event if more than one) will 
notify the COT, or designated representative if COT is not available, that additional training 
is complete (along with providing supporting mission grade sheet documentation) (T-3).  The 
COT, or designated representative, will sign and date the “Date Additional Training 
Completed” block in Section II of the AF Form 8 (T-3).  The COT annotates completion of 
the evaluation on the AF Form 4141 (T-3). 
6.4.  Permanent Training Record.  The COT maintains a permanent training record for all 
assigned and attached personnel.  The COT uses individual 6-part folders and identifies each 
folder by typing the individual’s last name, first name, and middle initial in capital letters on a 
standard size folder label.  This label is affixed to the folder’s tab.  The training officer may 
pencil in additional information on the label (e.g., rank, crew, director designator).  Tests or test 
answer sheets are not filed in this folder.  Current AF Form 4141/4142 data may be in a separate 
binder for ease of record keeping, but will be returned to the permanent training records prior to 
the individual’s permanent change of station (T-3).  Permanent training records may be 
maintained electronically in lieu of hard copies.  If maintained electronically, the format will be  
 
 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
35 
identical to the six-part folder.  A backup system for recovering the "digital" records due to 
system failure must be in-place (T-3).  The unit ensures continuous accessibility of the digital 
records.  NOTE: The COT will ensure recording of all items within the LMS (T-3).  DD Form 
2992 will be handled in accordance with paragraph 6.4.3 (T-3).  The permanent training record, 
to include electronic versions, is as follows: 
6.4.1.  Section I, Qualification Data.  This section contains the current data found in AF Form 
4141 and AF Form 4142.  If hard copies are maintained for AF Form 4141 entries, place the 
AF Form 4141 on the left side and AF Form 4142 on the right side of Section I (T-3).  Units 
with the LMS, PEX or other MAJCOM-approved electronic programs may maintain the data 
electronically; however, the information in both areas must match (T-3). 
6.4.2.  Section II, Personal History.  This section contains any other current 
records/documents pertaining to qualification or proficiency, to include waivers (T-2). 
6.4.3.  Section III, Medical Qualification/Medical Waivers.  This section includes a current 
copy of the DD Form 2992 for all AFSC 13B/1C5D personnel or Canadian equivalents.  A 
DD Form 2992 placing an individual on Duty Not Involving Controlling (DNIC) status is 
also kept during the DNIC period.  In addition, medical profiles that affect operational status 
will be filed in this section (T-3).  Sensitive medical history or other records of a personal 
medical nature will not be maintained in this file (T-3).  If medical documentation is 
sensitive, a memorandum for record, signed by the DO, is placed in this section (T-3).  This 
memo states the individual is removed from training and includes dates, if available (T-3).  
After an individual is placed on DNIC status, the COT will ensure the DD Form 2992, is 
maintained during the DNIC period (7 days or more), file it in the transitory files and 
annotate the AF Form 4141 (T-3). 
6.4.4.  Section IV, Training History.  This section includes certificates from AETC courses, 
MAJCOM formal courses, and any formal ground environment training.  This material is 
chronological with the latest date on top and kept as a permanent part of this folder.  Locally 
generated training records may be in this section while the individual is in IQT/MQT 
training.  The DO’s justification for late entry into IQT/MQT is in this section.  System 
specific task/task qualification, or the computer-generated product, is in this section or in a 
database.  Upon Permanent Change of Station (PCS), translate all computerized products into 
hardcopy or electronic means and placed in the appropriate section (T-3).  If training shops 
elect to use an alternative method to store Training History records, a memo for record 
signed by the Chief of Training (COT), is in this section. 
6.4.5.  Section V, Miscellaneous Experience.  This section contains completed AF Form 
4141/4142 and control experience forms from other commands.  File these forms 
chronologically with the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training folder (T-3). 
6.5.  Transfer of Records.  When transferring to a new unit, a student will hand carry the 
permanent records to the gaining unit (T-3).  If the gaining unit has access to the electronic 
management system, the unit administrator may transfer the record.  Where available, the 
information required by AF Form 4141/4142 will be in the LMS (instead of hardcopy) (T-3).  If 
the LMS version is used, the losing unit may release the record and the COT may print a hard 
copy or provide electronic copy of the AF Form 4141 and all AF Form 4142s data to be hand 
carried with the individual.  Upon in-processing operations training, the gaining unit will transfer 
the individual’s record into their unit’s domain (T-3). 
36 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
6.6.  Documentation Forms.  Training documentation consists of two forms: AF Form 4141 and 
AF Form 4142.  The LMS is the primary system of documentation for those units that access the 
LMS (T-2). 
6.6.1.  AF Form 4141.  This form records significant occurrences during individual training 
(T-3).  As a minimum the following events must be recorded: 
6.6.1.1.  The COT reviews all newly arriving individuals’ training records and ensures 
recording in the LMS (T-3).  The COT will use these instructions in conjunction with the 
ACC/A3CI-provided training documentation table for completing the AF Form 4141 
within the LMS (T-2). 
6.6.1.2.  When an individual has completed a transfer of training status from another unit, 
the COT will enter completion date and test scores (T-3). 
6.6.1.3.  The COT will annotate any removal from unit training for purposes of formal 
school attendance (T-3). 
6.6.1.4.  The COT will certify that a trainee has completed IQT/MQT (T-3). 
6.6.1.5.  The COT will record entry into CT-CMR or CT-BMC (T-3). 
6.6.1.6.  The DO will identify the primary duty position of multi-qualified personnel (T-
3). 
6.6.1.7.  The COT will document the appointment of an individual as an instructor by 
duty position (T-3). 
6.6.1.8.  The COT will document regression to NCMR/NBMC status and return to 
CMR/BMC status (T-3). 
6.6.1.9.  When the commander (CC) grants a probationary period for an individual to 
meet 3-month lookback requirements (T-3). 
6.6.1.10.  The DO records and certifies proration of requirements (T-3). 
6.6.1.11.  The COT will document specialized training/task certification (e.g., Emergency 
Action Coordinator) (T-3). 
6.6.2.  AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training Record.  This form documents annual 
training accomplishments.  The COT records academic and positional training requirements 
and instructor or STAN/EVAL monitored accomplishments on AF Form 4142.  (T-2).   
6.7.  Training Deficiency Reports (TDR).  Training Deficiency Reports identify problems 
beyond the unit’s ability to resolve and that may prevent the unit, or individual(s) from satisfying 
academic or positional TRs.  TDRs identify known or potential training problems to Higher 
Headquarters for information and management purposes.  TDR identified issues need to be 
resolved at the lowest level of command. 
6.7.1.  TDRs contain the following information: 
6.7.1.1.  Broken equipment that has an impact on training (to include simulation 
equipment) (T-2). 
6.7.1.2.  Lack of live and virtual events for training or evaluations (T-2). 
6.7.1.3.  Instructor/evaluator shortfalls (T-2).

Chapter 7 
KOREAN TACTICAL AIR CONTROL SYSTEM 
7.1.  General.  This chapter outlines CT requirements for personnel assigned to the 621 ACS.  
CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to 
maintain proficiency at the assigned qualification level.  All AFSC 13B and 1C5 personnel must 
attain CMR status in an authorized duty position, unless otherwise stated (T-2). 
7.2.  Waivers.  Submit waiver requests in accordance with paragraph 1.10.2 
7.3.  Logging CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators.  At the end of the lookback 
period, up to 50 percent of required positional CT events (rounded down to the next whole 
number, but not below 1) may come from instructor/evaluator monitored events.  The 
instructor/evaluator must have monitored mission planning and any briefings, missions, and 
debriefings (T-3). 
7.4.  Proration of Training Cycle Requirements. 
7.4.1.  At the end of the lookback period, the COT may prorate all positional training 
requirements when: 
7.4.1.1.  An individual is TDY, medically disqualified/DNIC, convalescent leave, or on 
emergency leave for 30 cumulative days or more.  Normal annual leave does not count as 
non-availability (T-3). 
7.4.1.2.  Upgrade occurs after the start of the lookback period.  Training accomplished 
during IQT/MQT will not count toward CT requirements (T-3). 
7.5.  Continuation Training (CT) Requirements.  The COT documents on the AF Form 4141 
that the trainee has completed training requirements and is CMR (T-3).  CT requirements consist 
of both academic and positional minimums identified below. 
7.5.1.  Academic Training Requirements.  The intent of the academic portion of CMR/BMC 
continuation training is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the unit’s tasked 
missions as well as dynamic real-world environment and ever-changing tactics, techniques 
and procedures. 
7.5.1.1.  The unit COT, in conjunction with Weapons and Tactics, administers and 
records the academic training that supports CT based on the review, update, and 
expansion of existing IQT/MQT materials, as well as the introduction of any unit unique 
current operations interest/focus areas (T-2). 
7.5.1.2.  As a minimum, academic CT requirements consist of 7 hours of quarterly 
training (T-3). 
7.5.1.3.  Academic CT requirements are prorated based upon the month the upgrade 
occurred (beginning the first full month following upgrade to CMR) (T-2). 
7.5.1.4.  The COT ensures documentation of CT in accordance with Chapter 6 (T-2).

Notes: 
1. Constructive Air Refueling (A/R) can count for 100% of live requirements. 
2. Air-to-air missions must be a minimum of 2vX events or greater (T-3). 
3. When live air-to-air and air-to-surface missions are not available to meet TRs, the DO may 
authorize an individual to substitute 50% of live requirements with constructive events. 
4. Instructor/evaluators can credit up to 50% of total training requirements from monitored 
missions on a one-to-one basis. 
5. Event operations equate to positional hours. 
6. Only Section Lead certified ABMs require positional hours 
7. Check-in will be a certification; however, there will continue to be lookback requirements. 
7.5.2.  Positional Requirements.  Personnel will complete the required number of events in 
Table 7.1 (T-3).  Due to annual rotation cycle associated with remote assignments, lookback 
requirements replace annual requirements (T-3). 
7.5.2.1.  Events accumulated during a TDY status, to include contingency operations, 
count toward lookback events.  However, crewmembers’ primary system lookback events 
will never be less than 50 percent of total requirements (T-3). 
7.5.2.2.  DNIC crewmember training in the virtual/constructive environment will count 
towards lookback requirements (T-3). 
7.5.2.3.  Training requirements are based upon crewmember experience level at the end 
of the 3-month lookback period (T-3). 
7.5.2.4.  Lookback calculations are based on the previous 3-months (T-3). 
7.5.2.5.  The COT will submit 3-month lookback reports no later than the 5th day of the 
month (T-3). 
 
 
40 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
7.5.2.6.  Lookback computations for newly qualified crew members begins following 
completion of INIT QUAL/MSN Eval, as applicable, and 3 full months of CMR status.  
Computation for crewmembers restored to CMR status will start the month following 
return to CMR status (T-3).  EXAMPLE: Capt Garza completed his/her INIT 
QUAL/MSN on 17 October.  His/her lookback computations will not begin until 1 
November.  Even though Capt Garza’s lookback does not start until 1 November, any CT 
accomplishments accumulated from 17 - 31 October count toward lookback 
requirements. 
7.5.3.  Failure to meet 3-Month Lookback.  All actions must be documented in accordance 
with Chapter 6 (T-2).  If a CMR crewmember fails to meet the 3-month lookback 
requirement, the DO may: 
7.5.3.1.  Regress the individual to NCMR status. 
7.5.3.2.  Remove the individual from a CMR position. 
7.5.3.3.  Place the crewmember in probation status for 1 month. 
7.5.3.4.  Document all actions in accordance with Chapter 6 (T-2). 
7.5.4.  Crewmembers that regress to NCMR status for less than 6 months will complete DO- 
approved training consisting of the following (as a minimum) before returning to CMR 
status: 
7.5.4.1.  Conduct a minimum of one effective control event, link event, and/or event 
operation, applicable to the duty position while monitored by an instructor (T-3).  The 
event will be completed on a live mission (T-3). 
7.5.4.2.  Upon completion of training, the instructor recommends return to CMR and the 
COT returns the individual to CMR status (T-3). 
7.5.4.3.  The missions and events accomplished during the training count toward a 
crewmember’s 3-month lookback (T-3). 
7.5.5.  If a crewmember is NCMR for more than 6 months, the COT will downgrade the 
crewmember to UQ status and they will enter into requalification training with subsequent 
requalification evaluation (T-3). 
7.5.6.  If a crewmember is UQ for more than 1 year, the COT will determine if the 
crewmember will be entered into requalification training or IQT/MQT (T-3). 
7.6.  Directed Downgrade to Unqualified (UQ) 
7.6.1.  The DO will direct the downgrade of a CMR/BMC qualified individual to UQ status 
when the individual fails any positional evaluation, fails to complete a QUAL/MSN by the 
expiration date, fails to regain CMR status within 6 months, or the DO determines an 
individual to be non-proficient (T-3).  When an individual is UQ, one of the following 
occurs: 
7.6.1.1.  The DO directs trainee entry into requalification training for 30 calendar days as 
required. 
7.6.1.2.  Unit CC takes appropriate administrative action in accordance with AFI 36-2101 
and/or AFI 11-401. 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
41 
7.6.1.3.  Upon successful completion of the requalification training, the COT releases the 
individual to STAN/EVAL to complete the requalification evaluation within 30 days. 
7.6.2.  NLT the 30th calendar day, of the requalification-training period (T-3) one of the 
following occurs: 
7.6.2.1.  The trainee completes the requalification training, and is released to 
STAN/EVAL by the COT (T-3). 
7.6.2.2.  The trainee does not complete the requalification training.  The trainee is 
referred to the unit DO to do one of the following: 
7.6.2.2.1.  Refer the trainee to the unit CC to take administrative action in accordance 
with AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401 (T-3). 
7.6.2.2.2.  Request an additional 30 calendar days of extended requalification training 
through the appropriate NAF to PACAF/A310.  The trainee will immediately enter 
the 30 calendar day extension while the request is being staffed (T-3).  These days 
will count towards the 30 days of extended requalification training (T-3). 
7.6.2.2.3.  If the NAF or PACAF/A310 denies the request then the unit CC takes 
action AFI 36-2101 and/or AFI 11-401.  The MAJCOM is the final approval for the 
additional 30 calendar days of requalification training. 
7.7.  Unit Certification Program.  Certification status is for positions (non-CMR/BMC) that 
complement, augment or assist the mission (T-3).  When applicable, each unit will develop and 
implement a training program for all unit certified positions in accordance with 
MAJCOM/NAF/Group/unit directives and document the certification in accordance with 
Chapter 6 (T-3). 
7.7.1.  The ABM Section Lead certification will train ABM’s responsible for supervising C2 
effects employed within the construct of a Battle Management Area (BMA) within the 
specified Area of Operations.  In coordination with the COT, the DO will recommend 
qualified ABMs to upgrade to Section Lead (SL).  ABMs will not upgrade to Instructor 
unless they have a SL certification (T-3). 
7.7.2.  The ABM Mission Commander (MC) certification will focus on employment at the 
C2 package commander level and higher, employing C2 effects in two or more BMAs at the 
same time.  The MC is the conduit between the operational level of operations and tactical 
execution.  The MC translates operational intent into tactical action by understanding assets 
available in the BMA, by executing force packaging and fusing capabilities to achieve a 
specified operational/tactical objective. 
7.7.3.  Course entry requirements for the SL and MC certification programs are in the 
applicable course control documents (T-3). 
7.8.  Multi-Qualified Personnel.  The DO may multi-qualify personnel who demonstrate the 
knowledge and proficiency skills required to maintain multiple duty position qualifications.  The 
purpose of multiple qualifications is to provide unit with flexibility to address a dynamic training 
environment and to increase combat capability. 
7.8.1.  Personnel selected to train in another position must complete IQT/MQT requirements 
in accordance with Chapter 2 (T-3). 
42 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
7.8.2.  Multi-qualified CMR/BMC personnel must achieve the performance standards and 
academic TRs for each position, however, when the academic requirements are identical, 
they need only be accomplished once (T-3).  Crewmembers who hold multiple qualifications 
must meet full 3-month lookback in their documented primary position and half the 3-month 
lookback in their documented secondary position.  No lookback requirement for either 
position will be less than one (T-3). 
7.8.3.  Upon completing an INIT QUAL/MSN for a secondary qualification, complete 
documentation in accordance with Chapter 6. Additionally, ensure the documentation 
reflects both a primary duty position and all other qualifications as secondary duty positions 
(T-2).  Individual training folders require a separate AF Form 4142 for each duty position (T-
2). 
7.9.  Augmenting Personnel.  The 621 ACS is required to develop/implement a training 
program for augmenting personnel (ABM/WD, AWO SD or Joint service equivalent) in 
accordance with unit directives.  The DO will ensure augmenting personnel are CMR (or service 
equivalent) in their home station primary weapon system.  Based on the unit approved training 
program, augmenting personnel are monitored by an instructor until certified.  Upon completion 
of certification, augmenting personnel may perform crew specific duties (T-3). 
7.10.  Event Operations/Positional Hours. 
7.10.1.  Senior Battle Management Technician (SBMT)/Data System Technician (DST) 
Event Operations/Positional Hours.  The SBMT/DST will receive credit for one operational 
event each time they perform duties (mission planning, supervising the mission crew, and 
debriefing the mission) as a CMR/BMC crewmember for an entire crew shift (T-3). 
7.10.2.  Section Lead (SL). 
7.10.2.1.  Event Operations/Positional Hours.  The SL will receive credit for one 
operational event each time they perform SL duties (mission planning, supervising the 
weapons crew, operations execution and debriefing the crew) as a CMR/BMC 
crewmember/lead, for an entire crew shift (T-3). 
7.10.2.2.  Controlled Event.  A controlled event will be in accordance with paragraph 
7.10.3.2 (T-3). 
7.10.3.  Air Battle Manager (ABM)/Weapons Director (WD). 
7.10.3.1.  Controlled Event.  A controlled event will include control of any of the 
following mission types: air-to-air, PR, A/R and air-to-ground (T-3). 
7.10.3.2.  A controlled event is credited when the following criteria are met (T-3): 
7.10.3.2.1.  Briefed/debriefed the mission/controlled event. 
7.10.3.2.2.  Took radar/radio control of the aircraft performing the mission. 
7.10.3.2.3.  Accomplished at least one of the following: 
7.10.3.2.3.1.  Air-to-Air.  The ABM/WD provides control to at least one flight of 
aircraft conducting air-to-air tactics against a dedicated adversary.  The ABM/WD 
will control the flight from hand-off to hand-off (T-3). 
 
 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
43 
7.10.3.2.3.2.  Air Refueling.  The ABM/WD provides control to an aircraft/flight 
conducting A/R in accordance with AFI 11-214.  The ABM/WD provides close or 
tactical control to an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight integrity is 
maintained) that rendezvous with a tanker/cell.  During A/Rs, the ABM/WD may 
credit one A/R mission per set of receivers or single receiver.  Weapons personnel 
may also credit more than one type mission during combined missions, in cases 
where the flight conducts another mission in addition to the refueling.  For 
example, if the ABM/WD conducts a rendezvous onto a tanker then takes the 
fighters off tanker and conducts intercepts, the weapons individual credits both an 
A/R and an air-to- air mission.  The A/R missions must be conducted in a live, 
virtual, constructive environment (T-3). 
7.10.3.3.  Swapping controllers: During air-to-air, air-to-ground or A/R missions, 
controllers may hand over the mission to another controller so that more than one person 
may log a control event during the conduct of the mission.  To log a control event, each 
ABM/WD must control fighters from fights-on/vulnerable time through terminate/knock-
it-off using close/tactical control.  For A/R mission each controller must meet the 
minimum A/R mission requirements (T-3).

Attachment 4 
TRAINING EVALUATION BOARD (TEB) PROCESS/PROCEDURES 
A4.1.  General.  The purpose of this attachment is to establish/outline specific procedures to be 
taken when non-rated personnel fail to make satisfactory progress in initial qualification, mission 
qualification, or continuation training.  Procedures to remove a rated officer from training and/or 
flying related duties/operations are outlined in Air Force Manual (AFMAN) AFI 11-402, 
Chapter 8, Flying Evaluation Boards.  This attachment only applies to non-rated personnel 
(officer and enlisted) assigned to an ADS.  The rights of non-rated personnel are contained in 
this attachment.  A TEB is not required for individuals in training for secondary or beyond 
qualifications. 
A4.2.  Guidance.  Per AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, Air Force guidance is to retain 
and retrain only those Airmen who have demonstrated the ability to complete training and whose 
past record clearly justifies further training.  In accordance with training syllabi elimination 
procedures, utilization of the administrative actions outlined in this attachment are based upon 
failure of an individual to attain a duty qualification, failure to re-qualify, or to maintain 
proficiency levels outlined in this manual.  These procedures are not meant to replace or be used 
in place of punitive disciplinary action and are not a substitute for action under the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice, state military law, or other administrative directives. 
A4.3.  Explanation of terms. 
A4.3.1.  Training Evaluation Board (TEB).  The TEB is an administrative, fact-finding 
proceeding designed to ensure the quality control of the ADS officer and enlisted force.  
Board members examine an individual’s professional qualification for BCC-related duties 
and evaluate/determine potential for use in future operations. 
A4.3.2.  Flying Evaluation Board (FEB).  A FEB is an administrative, fact-finding 
proceeding designed to ensure the quality control of the rated force.  Board members 
examine an aircrew member’s professional qualification for aviation related service, evaluate 
potential for use in future aviation duties, and make recommendations to higher authorities.  
A FEB may be established for a rated officer due to lack of proficiency, lack of judgment in 
the performance of duties, failure to attain/maintain qualification or meet training 
requirements, or when a rated officer exhibits questionable professional qualities or 
committed an intentional violation of aviation instructions or procedures.  Do not confuse 
this rated force tool with the TEB outlined in this attachment. 
A4.3.3.  Rated Aircrew Member.  A rated aircrew member is a commissioned officer who 
holds a USAF aeronautical rating.  The USAF considers rated officers to be in career aviation 
status and awards ratings only to pilots, navigators, ABMs, and flight surgeons. 
A4.3.4.  Appeal Authority.  The appeal authority for the TEB process outlined in this 
attachment is the convening authority.  In cases in which the unit/CC is the convening 
authority, the appeal authority is the commander/organization having a command 
relationship with the unit conducting the member’s training. 
A4.3.5.  Cause.  Failure of a crewmember to attain or maintain qualification in a crew 
position and/or failure to meet required standards when enrolled in an upgrade course. 
AFMAN13-1BCCV1  17 JULY 2020 
55 
A4.3.6.  Respondent.  A crewmember for whom the TEB action has been requested or is 
being considered.  The respondent will be given the opportunity to address the board to 
provide personal insight into their training deficiencies or provide any other information 
relevant to the boards’ recommendations.” 
A4.3.7.  Evidence.  The information/facts presented to the TEB.  This information may 
include anything related to the individual’s training, performance, or past evaluations.  The 
material gathered by the respondent's organization as evidence will contain a total profile of 
the individual (T-2).  Material may be collected from any source including past assignments.  
The student/crew member facing possible commander action will be given the opportunity to 
address the board to provide personal insight into their training deficiencies (T-2). 
A4.3.8.  Preponderance of the Evidence.  The preponderance of the evidence is the standard 
of proof to be used in arriving at findings in a TEB.  A preponderance of the evidence means 
simply the greater weight of credible evidence.”

A5.1.  Date.  Entries on the form are in chronological order.  Dates indicate when action 
occurred.  Keep backlog entries to a minimum. 
A5.2.  Mandatory Action to be Reported.  This column contains all the events that must be 
documented (T-3).  Do not enter events that are not operationally related (e.g., weapons/vehicle 
qualification, ancillary training).  Note:  621ACS will annotate “CRC” in place of “BCC” for all 
AF Form 4141/4142 LMS entries (T-2). 
A5.3.  Grades.  Record the date and grade of any written exam/positional evaluation 
A5.4.  Record of Authentication of Remarks.  This column contains the individual responsible 
for authenticating the entry (via signature).  The incumbent at the time of the event is the only 
one authorized to sign.  A signature block is required for hard copy records.  For positional 
evaluations, only the rank and last name of the examiner is required.  If the form must be re-
accomplished and the authorizing officials have departed the unit, enter the signature block and 
type or print “Signature Not Available” above the signature block (T-3).  For those units using 
the LMS, annotate the authorizing official in the comments field.  No signature is required 
however, the appropriate name of the individual must be typed in (T- 3).
