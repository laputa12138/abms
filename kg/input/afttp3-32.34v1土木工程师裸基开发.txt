APPLICATION: This publication previews techniques and procedures for 
establishing and developing contingency locations using Air Force civil engineer 
distinctive skills and capabilities-based equipment configurations. This AFTTP is 
nondirective and does not replace technical orders and manuals, or any applicable 
mandatory procedures or instructions. Personnel should adhere to applicable 
technical, safety, and policy requirements when performing tasks addressed in this 
publication. 
SCOPE: The data presented here addresses civil engineer tasks associated with 
development of airfields, facilities, utilities, base defense, and other key 
infrastructure and services at remote, austere, or bare base locations. For this 
document, “bare base” means “an installation having minimum essential facilities 
to house, sustain, and support operations to include, if required, a stabilized 
runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base should also have a 
source of water that can be made potable. Typically, Air Force beddowns at 
contingency locations rely on the use of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources 
(BEAR), or other mobile assets. Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (Prime 
BEEF) team leaders, supervisors, and other members may find the information 
and procedures addressed here useful when organizing, managing, and executing 
base development operations. Users of this publication are assumed to have a 
basic knowledge of BEAR assets and their use—readers without this fundamental 
knowledge should review AFPAM 10-219, Volume 6, Planning and Design of 
Expeditionary Airbases.

Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1. General Information. During bare base development, a main goal of Air 
Force civil engineers is to quickly set up infrastructure and services to support 
deployed aircraft operations and other contingency operations and missions. Civil 
engineer (CE) forces may accomplish this mission using standard techniques, 
procedures, and assets; however, depending on location and constraints, the use 
of expedient methods, adaptive techniques, and innovative procedures may be 
necessary for mission accomplishment. Operating locations could include main 
operating bases or “hubs,” forward operating bases (e.g., commercial airports, 
allied military airfields, abandoned or captured airfields, remote airstrips), or 
austere, dispersed locations and sites with a suitable segment of road or highway. 
Regardless of location or type of mission supported, efficient planning and use of 
resources is essential for CE combat support teams. 
 
1.2. Specialized Teams. During the initial stages of base development at 
contingency locations, CE work crews focus their efforts on areas that help bring 
about an initial operational capability, including airfields, facilities, structures, 
and services. These initial efforts evolve into base sustainment, and if later 
required, base recovery, transition, and closure. Generally, CE bare base 
development involve Prime BEEF and RED HORSE forces, however other teams 
with specialized skills and equipment may be employed, including contractor 
support. While other teams are mentioned, our primary focus here is Prime BEEF 
and RED HORSE operations.  
 
1.2.1. Prime BEEF. Prime BEEF forces provide a wide range of engineer support 
to establish, operate, sustain, recover, and reconstitute installations. The type and 
number of Prime BEEF teams needed at any contingency location depends on the 
planned size and type of mission force, airfield or base layout, site conditions, and 
other criteria that dictate the degree of engineering effort needed to prepare and 
sustain the location.  
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023

1.2.1.1. Prime BEEF teams have tailored personnel and equipment packages or 
unit type codes (UTC) with specific civil engineering capabilities to support 
wartime and other contingency missions in overseas theater(s) of operation. Find 
UTC details in the CE Supplement to the Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, 
Volume 1(WMP-1), on the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) 
Expeditionary 
Engineering 
Division 
(AFCEC/CXX) 
SharePoint 
at 
https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/13072/sitepages/publications.aspx.  
 
1.2.1.2. Although Prime BEEF teams are generally organized around specialties 
and abilities, multiskilling is inherently critical because many tasks will require 
more than one skill for accomplishment, and many more are not solely Air Force 
Specialty unique. For example, tasks such as camouflage and concealment, 
dispersal site construction, hardening, revetment erection, facility erection, etc., 
may require more workers than is provided by any one Air Force Specialty. 
Regardless of task and team makeup, remember to remain flexible and keep a 
mission perspective. 
 
1.2.1.3. The bare base development skills and knowledge possessed by Prime 
BEEF team members is substantial and provides a tremendous capability, but for 
some requirements, specialized skills and equipment may be necessary. In those 
situations, RED HORSE teams, Airfield Pavement Evaluation teams, Civil 
Engineer Maintenance, Inspection, and Repair teams, specialized teams from the 
635th Materiel Maintenance Group, and other teams deploy to locations requiring 
their expertise. Below is a brief review of these specialized teams.   
 
1.2.2. RED HORSE. RED HORSE Squadrons (RHS) provide a highly mobile, 
self-sufficient, heavy construction engineer force capable of rapid response and 
independent operations. Core capabilities include heavy construction and the 
ability to operate in austere, CBRN, or high threat environments. They can 
perform major vertical and horizontal construction and have specialized bare base 
taskings. For a detailed list of RED HORSE special capabilities see CE 
Supplement to WMP-1 on the AFCEC Expeditionary Engineering SharePoint at 
https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/13072/sitepages/publications.aspx. Some RED HORSE 
specialized capabilities are listed below:

1.3. Force Generation and Presentation. The Air Force generates and presents 
Airmen and airpower to support the Joint Force using the Air Force Force 
Generation (AFFORGEN) model (Figure 1.3) and Force Elements addressed in 
Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 10-401, Operations Planning and 
Execution.  
 
1.3.1. Phases of Readiness. AFFORGEN establishes a 24‐month rotational cycle 
with 6‐month phases. There are four rotational phases of readiness in the 
AFFORGEN cycle: 
 
• 
Reset (for reintegration and reconstitution) 
• 
Prepare (for training towards peak readiness) 
• 
Certify (for certification) 
• 
Available to Commit (for deployment)

1.3.2. Force Elements. Under AFFORGEN, a Force Element (FE) is an integrated 
set of UTCs the Air Force uses to offer operational capability to Joint Force 
Commanders. Joint Force Commanders request AFFORGEN Force Elements 
(Figure 1.4) through the Global Force Management process. Below is a brief 
overview of each AFFORGEN Force Element: 
 
Figure 1.4. AFFORGEN Force Elements. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
16 
 
 
1.3.2.1. Open the Airbase FE. Provides capabilities to open an airbase, regardless 
of follow-on mission. It arrives first and assesses an airbase for establishment of 
minimum airfield operating parameters. It consists of the initial capabilities for 
command and control (C2), force protection, cargo and passenger handling, 
logistics, airfield operations, force accountability, finance and contracting, host 
nation support, reception, and beddown of follow-on forces. The Open the 
Airbase FE sourcing will be based on the specific conditions and requirements of 
individual austere airfields. CE personnel, including RED HORSE and those 
assigned to Contingency Response Groups, airfield assessment teams, and other 
small units responsible for specific initial assessment and repair tasks will likely 
deploy with the Open the Airbase FE. Then, after completing their tasks, redeploy 
home to reconstitute or forward deploy to open a different site. 
 
1.3.2.2. Command and Control (C2) FE. Provides the capabilities to establish an 
Air Expeditionary Wing C2 structure to include initial wing, operations, 
maintenance, mission support, and medical group commanders and staffs. It 
enables C2 of all Air Expeditionary Wing forces, including MG FEs, from AEW 
locations. Prime BEEF units tasked to beddown and sustain forces at a given site 
typically deploy a command and control cadre with the Command and Control 
FE, with the remainder of the tasked Prime BEEF forces deploying with the 
Establish the Airbase and later FEs. 
 
1.3.2.3. Establish the Airbase (EAB) FE. Provides sufficient forces to bring an 
airbase to IOC status. It contains capabilities to support most missions or weapon 
systems and will integrate with Open the Airbase and C2 FEs as required. The 
EAB FE provides the airfield’s earliest capability to enable and sustain mission 
generation. Air Force civil engineers have a significant role when tasked to 
establish or develop contingency locations supporting Air Force missions and 
operations. Refer to Attachment 3 for a notional timeline of civil engineer bare 
base development tasks. 
 
1.3.2.4. Mission Generation (MG) FE. Provides combat, combat support (those 
that are specifically identified on the aviation/operational UTC’s mission 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
17 
 
capability statement), and combat service support capability. There are multiple 
types of MG FEs: Air Superiority, Global Precision Attack, Suppression of 
Enemy Air Defenses, Long Range Strike, High‐Altitude Intelligence, 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Air Refueling, Intra‐Theater Airlift, and 
Combat Search and Rescue. 
 
1.3.2.5. Operate the Airbase (OAB) FE. Enhances combat support and combat 
service support capabilities beyond what the EAB FE provides and brings an 
airbase to full operating capability. OAB enhances force protection, 
communications, cargo handling, and quality of life activities such as Chaplain 
Corps, services, health care, and reach‐back capabilities. 
 
1.3.2.6. Robust the Airbase (RAB) FE. Provides additional combat support and 
combat service support to increase the robustness of the capabilities already in 
place through previous FEs. It supports multiple MG FEs through additive 
capability. This FE is intended to enable the largest‐scale enduring expeditionary 
operating locations. 
 
1.3.2.7. Demand Force Teams (DFT). Teams composed primarily of UTCs from 
units or capabilities that operate independently, including unique, highly specific, 
combat, combat support, or combat service support capabilities. Example DFT 
capabilities include but are not limited to the Expeditionary Medical Support 
System, RED HORSE, and Tactical Air Control Party. 
 
1.4. Agile Combat Employment (ACE). ACE is a proactive and reactive scheme 
of maneuver executed within threat timelines to increase survivability while 
generating combat power. ACE is a way of generating, projecting, sustaining, and 
preserving airpower that shifts operations from large, centralized, and often 
vulnerable infrastructures (e.g., main operating bases (MOB)) to networks of 
smaller‐footprint dispersed locations to increase force survivability, complicate 
adversary planning, and provide more options to joint force commanders for 
power projection. For more information, see Air Force Doctrine Note (AFDN) 1-
21, Agile Combat Employment. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
18 
 
1.4.1. ACE uses tailored force packages with unit-assigned multi-capable Airmen. 
These tailored force packages provide mission generation (MG), command and 
control, and base operating support (BOS) as the mission dictates. Multi-capable 
Airmen should have diverse foundational skills that enable them to operate in a 
contested, degraded, and operationally limited environment with minimal 
support. 
 
1.4.2. The Base Operating Support-Integrator (BOS-I) team provides combat 
support and combat service support to open, establish, operate, and robust an 
airbase. BOS-I force packages provide capabilities including Rapid Airfield 
Damage Repair (RADR), UXO Removal, Air Rapid Response Kit Employment, 
Power Generation, Integrated Defense and Force Protection/Counter small 
Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace, 
and Health Service Support. 
 
1.4.3. CE forces are part of the BOS-I team. Whether at a main operating base or 
dispersed location, CE forces use their wide-ranging capabilities along with 
expedient facilities and utilities to help establish and maintain supporting 
infrastructure for Air Force forces deploying to the fight. CE forces could also be 
tasked to provide support to joint/combined forces at other sites or dispersed 
locations. For example, Prime BEEF forces have been tasked to build Army 
tactical operations centers (Figure 1.5), troop billets, latrines, showers, and other 
structures. 
 
1.5. Planning Information and Resources. Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-
219V5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning, describes CE’s role in planning and 
establishing contingency locations. It lists CE tasks related to bare base 
development, with emphasis on the use of BEAR assets to support force beddown 
and contingency operations. AFPAM 10-219V6, Planning and Design of 
Expeditionary Airbases, has information on airbase planning and resources. It 
focuses on designing, establishing, and sustaining expeditionary airbases. Other 
publications in AFPAM 10-219 Series and Air Force Tactics, Techniques and 
Procedures (AFTTP) 3-32 Series provide information on CE contingency 
planning, expedient methods, expeditionary airfield resource, and CE base

1.6. General Safety Hazards and Protection Guidelines. Whether constructing 
a beddown location from the ground up or upgrading existing facilities and 
infrastructure, civil engineering operations with heavy equipment, power 
production equipment, fuel systems, mechanical systems, high-pressure 
subsystems, water and waste systems, and others makes for a hodgepodge of job 
safety hazards. Things like flammable fuels, high voltages, dangerous chemicals, 
harmful solvents and adhesives infectious black and gray water, dust, and rotating, 
cutting, and crushing equipment associated with these operations are significant 
hazards. Following safety protocols will be critical to avoid injury or death. 
Always be vigilant to prevent unsafe acts and conditions. Compliance with

technical order warnings and cautions is essential and personnel should wear 
appropriate personal protective equipment. 
 
1.6.1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). No matter how effective PPE can be, 
it does not protect or benefit anyone unless it is available and properly worn. One 
of the most important responsibilities of a supervisor is to ensure their people 
understand the importance of wearing the necessary protective equipment for the 
working environment. In addition, individuals should properly use, inspect, and 
care for PPE assigned to them. Personal protective equipment is mandated in 
specific equipment T.O.s, TTPs, and local guidance. Attachment 4 lists PPE for 
selected civil engineer activities according to DAFMAN 91-203, Air Force 
Occupational Safety, Fire, and Health Standards. For certain electrical tasks, 
additional Arc Flash PPE is required. Arc Flash warning labels (Figure 1.6) 
should be present on switchgear, switchboards, panelboards, disconnect switches, 
industrial control panels, meter socket enclosures, and motor control centers. 
Personnel should comply with AFMAN 32-1065, Grounding & Electrical 
Systems, any time lethal voltages are involved. See UFC 3-560-01, O&M, 
Electrical Safety, and NFPA 70, National Electric Code for additional 
information.

1.6.2. Basic Safety Standards and Requirements. In addition to wearing required 
PPE, personnel should understand applicable safety standards and requirements 
in technical guidance before performing operations or using equipment. When 
technical guidance is followed, personnel can usually avoid unsafe acts and 
conditions. Guidance comes in many different forms, including instructions; 
technical orders (T.O.); technical manuals; commercial manuals; tactics, 
techniques, and procedures; handbooks; unified facilities criteria (UFC); and 
official on-line resources. Depending on the project or task, the guidance and 
instructions provided in these sources could be the difference between success 
and failure. Attachment 5 lists basic safety rules for specific civil engineering 
operations and equipment according to DAFMAN 91-203.

Chapter 2 
SITE PLANNING AND STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT 
2.1. Expeditionary Site Plans. When time and conditions permit, deploying units 
develop preliminary Expeditionary Site Plans before their forces arrive to 
establish the airbase. These site plans may cut across all functional areas and 
support Combatant Command wartime operations plans, as well as Major 
Command supporting plans. As indicated in AFI 10-404, Base Support and 
Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning, Expeditionary Site Plans are chiefly 
associated with locations without a permanent Air Force presence and may 
contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial beddown decisions. 
Sometimes, planners must develop Expeditionary Site Plans in short periods to 
meet contingency needs without full staffing or coordination. This suggests even 
when accomplishing an Expeditionary Site Plan beforehand, it may be lacking 
sufficient details to satisfy the needs of every tasked function, and significant 
planning may still be required to accomplish an efficient beddown for the 
incoming mission. Regardless, Prime BEEF team leaders should learn as much 
information as possible about factors affecting the beddown location before 
deploying—use every available resource at your disposal to help ensure mission 
success.  
 
2.2. General Planning Resources. Site planning resources and tools include 
those listed in Table 2.1. GeoBase and planning tools provides valuable 
information about potential or actual beddown locations, including site surveys, 
site mapping data and location imagery, facility and utility layout data; others 
provide planning resources and theater construction standards. The list is not all-
inclusive, and other data and resources may be available when planning 
development and beddown operations at expeditionary bare bases. Whether or not 
a site plan exists, or whether all data is available or not, on-site civil engineers 
will strive to develop requirements and sort out beddown priorities to get the 
critical efforts started quickly—sometimes before all details are known; and then 
site, layout, and erect or modify the facilities and utility systems as needed. For 
questions, information, and assistance contact the Air Force Civil Engineer 
Reachback Center and other resources using the links in Attachment 2.

2.3. Equipment Resources and Other Assets. Efficient beddown operations at 
a bare base or initial contingency location requires the appropriate types and quan-
tities of systems and materiel to establish the site for the operational mission. 
BEAR mobile assets and other base beddown materiel are essential resources for 
establishing and sustaining initial and temporary contingency locations.  
 
2.3.1. BEAR Assets. BEAR assets are flexible, modular, and scalable to meet an 
array of beddown missions. They consist of personnel shelters, aircraft shelters, 
food service facilities and equipment, hygiene facilities, power and water 
production and distribution equipment, heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration 
equipment, vehicles, runway lighting, vehicle maintenance equipment, and civil 
engineering equipment and associated spares. When combined, these systems and 
equipment make-up the infrastructure needed to establish an airbase in a deployed 
environment. Organized into capability-based configurations, BEAR assets allow 
Air Force and Combatant Commanders to employ only those capabilities required 
to meet the mission, thereby reducing the overall logistics footprint of BEAR sets. 
Note: Some BEAR assets may not remain in their current UTC configuration due 
to potential changes in War Reserve Materiel related to ACE requirements. 
 
2.3.1.1. BEAR capabilities, in the form of UTCs, are critical to employment 
planning for austere locations up to main operating bases. Important 
considerations include specific missions, locations, and population requirements. 
Built with the end-user in mind, BEAR synchronizes to other combat support 
UTCs to arrive as needed to enhance the incremental buildup of an operating 
location. A critical enabler of the FE construct, BEAR plays a key role in Open, 
Establish, and Operate the Airbase FEs. 
 
2.3.1.2. BEAR UTCs supporting the Open the Base FE are associated with initial 
beddown forces and Contingency Response Groups. Postured UTCs include those 
designed to provide basic hygiene, billeting, power, lighting, water, and Meals 
Ready-to-Eat for the initial cadre. 
 
2.3.1.3. A significant portion of BEAR UTCs supports the Establish the Airbase 
FE. These UTCs synchronizes with other combat support capabilities to provide 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
26 
 
shelters, billeting, messing, lighting, and power capabilities that arrive on or about 
C-day and are designed to provide an initial operational capability within the first 
few days of arrival. Those UTCs supporting the Operate the Base FE include 
engineering, structural and fuels facilities necessary to complete the deployed 
location layout and support quality of life activities, such as Chaplain and the 
Tactical Field Exchange. 
 
2.3.1.4. For the Mission Generation FE, BEAR UTCs support both Combat Air 
Forces and Mobility Air Forces, and contain maintenance shelters, lighting, and 
aircraft supporting structures. Mission Generation UTCs are tasked in response to 
numbers of aircraft being supported. 
 
2.3.1.5. The importance of BEAR (including legacy equipment sets) and non-
BEAR assets to bare base development is readily apparent. The proper flow of 
these assets is critical to establishing the airbase and generating the mission. 
Obtaining non-essential assets early in the logistics flow merely congests off-load 
areas, increases the potential for loss or damage to items, and does little to provide 
immediate mission capability. The capabilities-based configuration of BEAR 
assets should remedy many of these problems. However, as users and installers of 
much of the base equipment, and in planning for contingency beddown 
operations, civil engineers have a vested interest in, and responsibility for 
influencing the flow of BEAR assets. The theater logistics staff, with input from 
the CE staff, usually determine selection and time phasing of BEAR and other 
assets for a given site. Base-level engineers can influence the process by working 
with their unit-level logistics plans office and the theater CE staff. While engineer 
planners can influence the planned flow of equipment, the real-time availability 
of transportation assets is a significant factor. Understanding the pressures applied 
to limited airlift resources available to support all the Services’ deployment 
requirements, the Air Force designed and configured BEAR assets with 
transportation flexibility in mind. Therefore, BEAR packaging is in a multi-modal 
configuration for both air and surface transportation. Anticipate nearly one-third 
of all BEAR configurations will be for air shipment. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
27 
 
2.3.2. Non-BEAR Assets. Non-BEAR assets also play an essential role. Items like 
non-BEAR 
support 
equipment 
and 
vehicles, 
expeditionary 
medical, 
communications, and Force Support facilities, fuels mobility support equipment, 
Air Force Contract Augmentation Program and locally contracted resources, and 
the Army’s Force Provider assets are just a few examples. Any of these resources 
can be part of the asset mix needed for successful development of a contingency 
base. Although our engineer workforce has a long tradition of innovative and 
flexible use of available resources to satisfy command and mission requirements, 
we continue to apply lessons learned and use the ever-changing tools that improve 
our processes and product. For Prime BEEF forces, this includes employment of 
non-BEAR assets we may encounter at expeditionary operating locations. 
 
2.4. Bare Base Development Stages and Tasks. The systematic establishment 
of a bare base follows a pattern comprised of four stages. They are initial, 
intermediate, follow-on and sustainment. However, CE teams accomplish bare 
base development tasks according to the commander’s priority for the stages. 
Table 2.2 is an example of how units may prioritize base development tasks. 
During the initial and intermediate stages, most tasks will fall in the upper two 
priorities. In the follow-on stage, tasks will shift more toward the lower priorities 
on the list. In any case, some of the tasks in the various stages will overlap because 
of their scope or labor requirements. Note: Any of the four stages or associated 
base development tasks could be reordered or truncated due to the operational 
environment or application of ACE scheme of maneuver. For example, many base 
development tasks beyond the initial stage may not be necessary for beddown 
operations at dispersed sites or locations. In addition, tasks from any stage may 
be accelerated or not accomplished at all due to constraints of the operational 
environment.

BARE BASE FACILITY LAYOUT 
 
3.1. General Information. Facility siting and layout are critical tasks that set the 
stage for bare base development. Planners consider the unit’s organic assets, 
incoming BEAR, and other mobile and local assets when determining facility 
siting requirements. When there is limited or non-existent infrastructure, the 
placement and spacing of BEAR facilities and systems may depend on the 
physical layout of the terrain, tactical and operational requirements, integrated 
defense and force protection requirements, and the availability of resources. An 
organized facility layout enhances operations, whereas a poor site layout could 
degrade operations, increase operational costs, affect physical health, reduce 
coordination and corporation among units, and erode morale. Note: Facility 
layouts should also address any tactical or operational requirements, and any 
adaptive planning considerations related to application of ACE concepts. 
 
3.2. Facility Placement and Spacing. Laid out facility groups often affect each 
other. If the base boundary allows for a conventional layout, consider gradually 
relocating support facilities, billeting, and Force Support functions away from the 
flightline and industrial support areas. If the base area is long and narrow, a linear 
layout may be necessary. As illustrated in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2, allocate 
space in each facility group for future expansion and growth (including utilities). 
Consult the theater engineer staff about command-specific, construction standards 
and potential beddown and space requirements for follow-on aircraft squadrons 
and other missions. In some instances, the base may need ramp space to disperse 
aircraft assets for protection. An airfield layout with varied parking patterns 
provides fewer lucrative targets for indirect-fire weapons. Review AFTTP 3-2.68, 
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening, for 
airfield layout options and examples. Placement and spacing of facilities also 
affect the space available for construction of revetments and personnel bunkers. 
If we do not account for these requirements initially, the result may be higher risk 
facility configurations or a requirement to relocate utility systems. Be sure to 
consult Bioenvironmental Engineering for methods to reduce or minimize base

population exposures to health hazards (noise, chemical, radiation, etc.) during 
base development. The Bioenvironmental Engineering flight conducts health-
based site assessments for initial contingency locations up to enduring bases.

3.2.1. Minimum Antiterrorism Standards. In addition to conforming to theater-
specific construction standards, expeditionary structures should comply with UFC 
standards to the maximum extent possible given the current operational 
environment. See minimum antiterrorism standards prescribed in UFC 4-010-01, 
DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Building, Appendix D, and UFC 4-
020-01, DOD Security Engineering Facilities Planning Manual. Standoff 
distances and facility separation is especially critical for these structures because 
hardening may not be possible or may be prohibitively expensive. The following 
paragraphs address standoff distances, structure separation, and facility dispersal. 
 
3.2.1.1. Standoff Distances and Structure Separation. Using standoff distances 
minimizes the accessibility and vulnerability of a facility. These distances are 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
39 
 
critical when siting a facility and can effectively mitigate indirect fire and 
improvised explosive device attacks. Structure separation requirements are 
established to minimize the possibility an attack on one structure causes injuries 
or fatalities in adjacent structures. The separation distance is predicated on the 
potential use of indirect fire weapons. UFC 4-010-01 lists standoff distances and 
separation for expeditionary and temporary structures. Always refer UFC 4-010-
01 and theater construction standards for specific requirements. 
 
3.2.1.2. Facility Dispersal. While standoff and separation distances are important 
to base defense, dispersed facility layouts may also reduce risks in high threat 
areas by taking full advantage of terrain and site conditions. Consequently, 
nothing in the standoff distances or separation standards discourages dispersal 
were appropriate. Figure 3.3 depicts examples of dispersed layouts for facility 
groups, excluding billeting. By combining the appropriate number of groupings, 
units can layout an entire facility group in a short period. Illustrated in Figure 3.4 
is an example of a dispersed billeting area layout. Plan an entire billeting group 
by combining this type of area layout. Remember, factors such as available 
resources and utilities may limit facility dispersal distances. For example, if 
dispersed facilities will be supported by utility systems (e.g., electrical, water and 
waste distribution systems), make appropriate adjustments to the utility sizes and 
quantities when site plans are changed to accommodate actual field conditions, 
topography changes, and local dispersal requirements. 
 
3.2.2. Other Layout Considerations. When reviewing facility group layouts, make 
sure everything can fit well within the real estate available, and according to 
facility and group dispersal requirements. Additionally, since much of the initial 
base traffic will be operating from flightline locations, build the overall 
facility/group layout around a road network providing easy access to various 
points on the flightline. This is also a good time to look at the locations for utility 
plants, evaporation beds, and stabilization lagoons (if required). Ensure the 
locations of sewage lagoons are downwind from the base.

3.2.2.1. Illustrated in Figure 3.5 is a hypothetical base layout using BEAR assets. 
The locations of all large facilities, such as aircraft hangers, frame supported 
tension fabric shelters or dome shelters should be marked on the site layout map. 
Illustrate a representative sampling of the more common medium and small 
shelter systems. Provide a general template (and dispersal pattern if necessary) to 
survey crews tasked to eventually stake out the facility groups. 
 
3.2.2.2. Once site layout is completed, engineer survey crews should begin the 
sizable task of physically marking the locations of the various bare base assets. 
Use more than one crew and augment with other shop or base personnel, if 
necessary. If required, survey crews should identify and mark the locations of the 
mobile aircraft arresting systems and airfield lighting components. 
 
3.2.2.3. Have crews initially mark the boundaries (corners and intermediate points 
if distances are long) of the various facility groups. Use markers that are relatively 
permanent (e.g. driven stakes) since they will become benchmarks for starting the 
location marking of individual facilities and assets. Use expedient survey methods 
during this process, for example, "walking off" distances, using vehicle 
odometers, or using a hand compass for turning angles. 
 
3.2.2.4. After laying out facility groups, concentrate on locating individual 
facilities within each facility group. In smaller groups (e.g., aerial port, squadron 
operations, alert area, etc.), the location of all facilities can be pinpointed at one 
time. In large groups, such as the billeting complex, locate only a portion of the 
total requirement initially—do not get distracted trying to locate positions of 
facilities for people who will not be arriving for a few days. These large areas can 
be marked after other important operational portions of the base are completed. 
Use expedient survey methods for laying out individual facilities. Because 
individual facility layout is repetitious with respect to distances between 
buildings, a couple of pieces of rope cut to the proper spacing intervals can be 
used as a quick and accurate way of measuring and locating facility positions.

AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
43 
 
3.2.2.5. Plan the locations of water and electrical plants and distribution systems 
early in the site layout process. Review AFH 10-222V11, Contingency Water 
System, Installation and Operation, and AFTTP 3-32.34V5, Contingency 
Electrical Power Production and Distribution System, when siting and installing 
these systems. Coordinate plans with shop superintendents and survey crews to 
optimize constructability, serviceability, and speed of initial setup. See Chapter 
7 and Chapter 8, in this publication for more information on bare base utilities. 
 
3.2.2.6. Take into consideration the location and routing of fuel distribution 
system during the initial facility layout. Carefully consider the placement of fuel 
lines and hoses to ensure safety and fuel hose/line integrity. Strive to design road 
layout so fuel lines/hoses will not cross roads. If facility expansion requires 
intersecting fuel hoses/lines with roads, provide a trench with a hardened cover to 
protect the fuel hose/line. 
 
3.2.2.7. Cryogenics (liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen) storage and servicing 
facilities (Figure 3.6) have specific siting requirements and should be part of 
initial base planning. DAFMAN 91-203 lists siting and safety requirements for 
liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen facilities. Because of the special hazards 
associated with liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, exercise care when siting these 
facilities. A paved road is required to and from the facility for delivery, 
maintenance, and emergency vehicles according to AFI 23-201, Fuels 
Management, and the area around the Cryogenics facilities where spills are most 
likely to occur (i.e., storage tanks, receiving and servicing area, and servicing cart 
parking areas) should be concrete with non-petroleum based sealant between the 
joints. Utility services (water, electricity and sewage) should also be coordinated 
with the installation civil engineer. 
 
3.2.2.7.1. Liquid oxygen storage facilities having a capacity of 100 gallons or 
more will conform to the standards listed in DAFMAN 91-203. 
 
3.2.2.7.2. Further information can be found in the Air Force 32-series publications

AIRFIELD PREPARATIONS 
 
4.1. General Information. Upgrading, modifying, or restoring an existing 
airfield to full operational or mission-ready status can be a considerable bare base 
development task. Even after the “Open the Airbase” phase is completed, our 
Prime BEEF forces continue the enormous task of developing the airfield and 
support facilities for the intended mission. Airfield development tasks include 
clearing airfield hazards and obstacles, repairing pavement, installing and 
repairing aircraft arresting systems, constructing revetments and berms, setting up 
airfield lighting, implementing dust control measures, and many other tasks. This 
chapter provides insight into these and other areas related to airfield development. 
 
4.2. Airfield Hazard Clearance. Clearing airfield hazards is a top priority and 
usually begins during the airfield-opening phase of bare base development. Initial 
engineer forces, using information garnered from airfield assessments and the 
situation on the ground, start to clear hazards as soon as practical after arriving on 
station. Obviously, unexploded explosive ordnance or scattered wreckage and 
debris on airfield pavements pose considerable hazards and will probably have 
the innate attention of both the mission commander and engineers until the airfield 
is operational. When Prime BEEF forces arrive, the airfield clear zone should be 
free of most hazards and obstacles, but crews should remove or mitigate any 
remaining hazards early in the beddown process. 
 
4.2.1. Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Hazards. Whether found during 
force beddown operations or recovery after an attack, the presence of UXO is a 
threat to operations, installations, personnel and materiel. Safing and clearance of 
these deadly hazards is a responsibility of EOD teams. EOD teams may defuse, 
detonate, or perform other actions to neutralize munitions “in-place,” or they may 
move munitions to a nearby, isolated, and protected location to defuse, detonate, 
or otherwise abate the immediate threat. As soon as EOD personnel have 
progressed sufficiently down the airfield, engineer teams using safe practices, can 
begin or continue tasks, such as crater repairs, wreckage removal, marking, etc. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
46 
 
4.2.1.1. Expect a slower, more extended UXO clearing process during site layout 
and construction (i.e., shelter erection, constructing defensive fighting positions, 
or running utilities). EOD teams will clear UXOs from these areas before 
construction begins. Heavy equipment operators should level any craters created 
by in-place UXO demolition. Once clearing procedures are completed, erection 
of facilities and surface layout of utilities can proceed within the cleared areas. 
Burying utilities can present additional challenges. Mines and UXOs located 
below the surface, especially in areas subject to flooding with drifting soil and 
sand, could explode when hit or uncovered during trenching operations. EOD 
teams may need to scan or sweep for additional UXO and mines directly along 
the planned pathways for utility trenching. Note: Under certain circumstances, 
our joint and coalition partners with UXO clearing capability may assist in 
clearing large numbers of mines or UXO from planned beddown areas. 
 
4.2.1.2. While EOD teams are responsible for UXO clearing, civil engineer units 
task other engineer personnel to support them. Table 4.1 lists a few tasks 
supporters may perform to assist EOD activities. Supporters should always follow 
EOD guidance and seek additional information on UXO operations from the 
references provided at the end of this chapter. 
 
Table 4.1. Tasks Supporting EOD. 
 
Support Tasks 
Construct protective berms around danger zones 
Provide heavy equipment support to access or remove UXO 
Roping off areas around UXO 
Reinforcing adjacent structures 
Isolating major utilities around UXO areas 
 
4.2.1.3. Protective Measures. Before any UXO clearance operation begins, take 
measures to protect personnel and equipment by evacuating, isolating, barricad-
ing, or any combination thereof. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
47 
 
4.2.1.3.1. Evacuate. Adhering to evacuation distances in AFTTP 3-2.12, Multi-
Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Explosive Ordnance, evacuate 
all nonessential personnel and equipment in the danger zone before commencing 
UXO clearance operations. Allow movement within the danger zone to essential 
personnel only. Personnel who must remain in the area should wear all protective 
equipment including Kevlar helmets and vests. 
 
4.2.1.3.2. Isolate. For mission related, operational, or other critical reasons, when 
evacuation of some mission essential personnel or equipment is not an option. To 
the greatest extent possible, isolate these assets from, and limit exposure to, the 
immediate vicinity of the UXO. 
 
4.2.1.3.3. Barricade. Use barricades to protect mission-essential personnel and 
equipment that must stay in the hazard area. Barricading provides limited 
protection by blocking blast and fragmentation from an explosion. 
 
4.2.1.3.3.1. Construct suppressive barricades (Figure 4.1) to isolate an explosion, 
to deflect thermal and shock waves and absorb low-angle, high-speed fragments. 
 
Figure 4.1. Suppressive Barricades Isolate Explosions. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
48 
 
4.2.1.3.3.2. On the other hand, construct protective barricades (Figure 4.2) around 
exposed resources to shelter them from overpressure and the impact of high-angle, 
low-speed fragments, which can escape over the top of “suppressive” barricades. 
See AFTTP 3-2.12 for more information on barricade construction and UXO 
operations. 
 
Figure 4.2. Protective Barricades Shields Resources. 
 
 
 
4.2.2. Wreckage and Debris Hazards. Removing wreckage and debris hazards 
from runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas is essential to increase airfield 
operability. Materials initially pushed aside to establish an expedient airfield 
(minimum operating strip or landing zone), or left in nonessential areas can be 
removed when time and resources become available. Consider pushing materials 
into craters at the scene, moving it to a central location for disposition, or loading 
it into dump trucks and transporting to a remote location for disposal. Whatever 
the case, engineers should remain vigilant when using heavy equipment and be 
on the lookout for UXO. 
 
4.2.2.1. Equipment. The type of equipment needed to clear aircraft operating 
surfaces depends on the size and amount of debris. The presence of large pieces 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
49 
 
of wreckage or debris (e.g. damaged vehicles, aircraft, or pavement sections) 
necessitates the use of heavy equipment such as bulldozers and cranes. However, 
many of the heavy equipment items needed may not be on the first series of 
incoming airlift sorties. Until these assets arrive, consider working with the 
contracting officer to find local sources of heavy equipment and materials. The 
following are equipment options for performing debris-clearing operations: 
 
4.2.2.1.1. Crane. For removing extremely large chunks of debris, a crane may be 
the only suitable piece of equipment. 
 
4.2.2.1.2. Bulldozer. A bulldozer has the power to push large pieces of debris out 
of an area and can quickly clear large areas of smaller debris. One skilled dozer 
operator can clear an area that would require several hours of labor if done by 
hand. 
 
4.2.2.1.3. Front-End Loader. Front-end loaders are especially useful in loading 
debris on dump trucks and other vehicles for removal from the site. They also are 
adequate for clearing paved areas and streets of large amounts of small debris. 
 
4.2.2.1.4. Dump Truck. Dump trucks haul debris to disposal sites. Other suitable 
vehicles, such as cargo trucks and tractor-trailer units, can sometimes substitute 
for them. 
 
4.2.2.1.5. Sweepers. After the removal of larger debris from an area, consider 
using street sweepers and vacuum trucks to clear smaller items from aircraft 
operating surfaces and primary access streets. If sweepers are not used, small 
metal items left on roadways and working areas can cause tire damage to aircraft 
and equipment involved in cleanup operations. Time spent repairing and replacing 
flat tires on these vehicles delay the overall recovery effort. 
 
4.2.2.1.6. Towing Devices. Steel cable, chains, hooks, and similar items can be 
fashioned into towing devices for debris removal. Use care when selecting towing 
devices; ensure they are appropriate and strong enough for the job. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
50 
 
4.2.2.2. Manpower. Generally, manpower is stretched to the limit during airfield 
opening operations; therefore, focus available resources to clear debris from 
minimum airfield operating surfaces first. 
 
4.2.3. Airfield Obstructions. Crews should quickly remove debris from airfield 
pavements to facilitate recovery and launch of aircraft and to accommodate 
aircraft parking and loading requirements. However, obstructions along the 
approach or departure ends of the runway, around ramps and taxiways, or near the 
adjacent terrain may still need to be removed (Figure 4.3). Be especially 
observant of terrain features or obstacles that could affect wing tip clearance of 
wide-body aircraft. However, it may not be prudent to have crews remove items 
in the outer edges of the clear zones that produce minimal danger (a culvert head 
wall for example)—in these instances, airfield authorities may initially accept the 
risk. Also, be sure to check the shoulders of runways and taxiways and the grounds 
along access routes to aprons and ramps for potential foreign object debris- 
producing areas. 
 
Figure 4.3. Removing Destroyed Tank near Taxiway. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
51 
 
4.3. Airfield Repairs and Restoration. Immediate repair and restoration may 
include selection of a minimum operating strip, expedient airfield or landing zone 
marking and repairs, pavement sweeping and cleaning, pavement marking and 
striping, site preparation for installation of navigational aids, and installing 
airfield lighting and mobile aircraft arresting systems (MAAS). The goal is to 
have the airfield ready to commence aircraft operations as soon as possible. As 
soon as a minimum operating strip is established, plan on immediately dedicating 
equipment and personnel to around-the-clock airfield sweeping operations since 
there will likely be considerable aircraft and vehicle traffic on pavement surfaces 
as bare base assets are delivered, off-loaded and transported from ramp areas. 
 
4.3.1. Navigational Aids. Support for navigational aids includes clearing and 
leveling areas for setting up mobile communications equipment. Normally these 
areas are not particularly large (2,500 sq. ft. or so), but plan on having to clear and 
grade vehicle access ways up to 1,000 feet long to these sites and provide 
electrical service. See UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, 
and consult with Communications personnel for specific siting requirements. 
 
4.3.2. Minimum Operating Strip. By definition, the Minimum Operating Strip is 
a runway that meets the minimum requirements for operating assigned and/or 
allocated aircraft types on a particular airfield at maximum or combat gross 
weight. When airfield damage, unexploded ordnance, or other obstructions 
prevent immediate and full use of the runway, quickly selecting a Minimum 
Operating Strip for operation of mission aircraft is essential. Minimum operating 
strip layout usually involves identifying the location or layout of the areas listed 
in Table 4.2. See AFPAM 10-219V4, Airfield Damage Repair Operations, for 
more Minimum Operating Strip information. 
 
4.3.3. Landing Zones. Landing zones support contingency airlift operations for C-
130 and C-17 aircraft. Potential landing zone areas fall into two basic categories: 
prepared and semi-prepared (unpaved). Prepared areas may include existing 
airfields, roads, highways, or other paved surfaces. Semi-prepared surfaces are 
natural areas such as deserts, dry lakebeds, and flat valley floors (Figure 4.4). 
These surfaces offer the ability to construct short airstrips for a limited use and 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
52 
 
may or may not have an aggregate surface. Although Prime BEEF forces do not 
usually perform the initial construction of landing zones, they could be involved 
with maintaining the landing zones if flight operations continue. Surface 
maintenance may include soil stabilization, adding an aggregate course, dust 
control, or compacting in-place soils. For additional surface maintenance 
information, refer to UFC 3-260-01, UFC 3-250-09FA, Aggregate Surfaced 
Roads and Airfields Areas, UFC 3-250-11, Soil Stabilization for Pavements, and 
UFC 3-260-17, Dust Control for Roads, Airfields, and Adjacent Areas. 
 
4.3.4. Airfield Markings. Airfield markings should adhere to precise guidelines 
that conform to recognized standards for aircraft operations as identified in 
AFMAN 32-1040, Civil Engineer Airfield Infrastructure Systems. While these 
standards are ideal under normal circumstances, it is unlikely sufficient time will 
exist to restore the markings to their original condition following an attack. The 
marking team should be ready to apply expedient techniques that will mark the 
usable runway surface in the shortest possible time to launch and recover aircraft 
in a timely fashion.

Figure 4.4. C-17 Lands on Semi-Prepared Landing Zone. 
 
 
 
4.3.4.1. Minimum Operating Strip Markings. Minimum Operating Strip markings 
consist of threshold and centerline pavement markings, edge markers, and aircraft 
arresting system location and distance-to-go (DTG) markers. Marking teams may 
use pavement markings and markers together or independently. For the basic 
layouts for marking and striping a Minimum Operating Strip, see T.O. 35E2-6-1, 
Minimum Operating Strip Marking System, Layout and Marking Procedures for 
Rapid Runway Repair. 
 
4.3.4.2. Landing Zone Markings. Personnel should consult DAFMAN 13-217, 
Drop Zone, Landing Zone, and Helicopter Landing Zone Operations, for marking 
and lighting schemes and dimensional criteria for landing zones.  
 
4.3.5. Expedient Airfield Pavement Repairs. There are various reasons why 
expedient repairs to airfield pavements may be necessary, they include, war 
damage by our forces in a battle for the airfield; deliberate damage the enemy did 
before yielding the field to our forces; poor or substandard construction; or 
general disrepair due to inadequate upkeep and maintenance. Whatever the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
54 
 
reason, pavement repairs during the initial period of beddown should usually be 
rapid in nature (e.g., compacted crushed stone, cold mix, quick set cements, etc.), 
due to pressing operational need. When time permits, upgrade expedient repairs 
to sustainment repairs to allow more aircraft passes between maintenance of the 
repairs. When appropriate, upgrade the sustainment repairs to permanent repairs. 
 
4.3.5.1. Spall Repair. Generally, a spall is pavement surface damage that does not 
penetrate through the pavement surface to the underlying layers (Figure 4.5), and 
less than 5 feet in diameter. As a norm, spalls are easier to correct than crater 
damage, providing the number of spalls are not overwhelming. For specific spall 
repair procedures, see UFC 3-270-01, O&M, Asphalt and Concrete Pavement 
Maintenance and Repair. 
 
Figure 4.5. Repairing Spall Damage at Deployed Location. 
 
 
 
4.3.5.2. Crater Repair. Craters represent damage that penetrates through the 
pavement surface into the underlying base and sub grade soil, which uplifts the 
surrounding pavement and ejects base, sub base soils, rock, and pavement debris 
around the impact area. Craters are more severe damage than spalls. Large craters 
have an apparent diameter equal to or greater than 6 m (20 ft.). Small craters have 
an apparent diameter less than 6 m (20 ft.). There are several crater repair methods 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
55 
 
and newer methods are often being tested and evaluated  (Figure 4.6). For specific 
crater repair methods and criteria, refer to Tri-Service Pavement Working Group 
Manual (TSPWG M) 3-270-01.3-270-07 O&M: Airfield Damage Repair, and 
AFPAM 10-219V4. 
 
Figure 4.6. Practicing New Rapid Airfield Damage Repair Methods. 
 
 
 
4.3.6. Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting may not be important for routine 
daytime aircraft operations, but it is essential for flight in an environment with 
limited visibility. Restoration of the existing permanent lighting system may not 
be feasible due to the extent of damage or location of existing lighting relative to 
the Minimum Operating Strip; if this is the situation, initially install an Emergency 
Airfield Lighting System (Figure 4.7). If considerable daylight will be available 
after anticipated airfield damage repair operations, airfield lighting should not be 
immediately critical to aircraft launch and recovery efforts; therefore, consider 
delaying installation so teams can work on higher priorities. On the other hand, if 
the onset of darkness or limited visibility due to bad weather is a factor, start 
airfield lighting installation as soon as possible. T.O. 35F5-3-17-1, Lighting 
System, Airfield, Emergency A/E82U-2 provide procedures for installing the 
Emergency Airfield Lighting System. In most cases, the question will be when to 
install the lighting system, not whether one is necessary.

56 
 
Figure 4.7. Engineers Install Emergency Airfield Lighting System. 
 
 
 
4.3.7. Perimeter and Critical Area Lighting. Portable lighting is included in both 
the BEAR beddown sets and the equipment packages for airfield damage repair. 
They primarily consist of the Remote Area Lighting System and TF-2 Light Carts 
(Figure 4.8). However, some packages may still contain legacy lighting systems. 
The Remote Area Lighting System provide for general lighting along the 
flightline, around POL or Cryogenics storage, etc. Refer to T.O. 35F5-5-22-1, 
Remote Area Lighting System (RALS), for installation instructions. The TF-2 light 
cart is a mobile floodlight unit used for large area lighting. Primarily for initial 
camp beddown, typical uses include perimeter lighting and flightline. To setup 
and operate the TF-2, see T.O. 35F5-5-21-1, Flood Light, Trailer Mounted, Type 
TF-2. 
 
4.3.8. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). The MAAS provides expedient 
aircraft arresting capabilities for arresting hook-equipped fighter aircraft and is 
capable of up to 20 aircraft engagements per hour (Figure 4.9). If the arresting 
system is necessary, Minimum Operating Strip layout personnel should mark its 
location prior to the arrival of the MAAS installation team. Detailed information 
regarding applications and capabilities of this system is available in T.O. 35E8-2-
10-1, Mobile Aircraft Arresting Systems (MAAS).

4.3.9. Aircraft Parking/Pavement Expansion. After meeting initial airfield 
operational requirements, additional pavement for aircraft parking and servicing 
may be necessary. Requirements may include aircraft parking aprons for 
incoming deployed aircraft and special pavement areas such as arm/de-arm pads, 
hot cargo pads, quick turn areas, compass rose, and wash racks, along with the 
accompanying tie-down anchors and static grounding points. Sometimes, existing 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
58 
 
pavements can double for some requirements; however, if it is necessary to 
provide additional pavement areas, be sure to follow safety distance criteria 
associated with the particular project (arm/de-arm, hot cargo, etc.). Also, ensure 
expansion projects meet specific characteristics (e.g., size, weight, etc.) of the 
supported aircraft. The Geospatial Expeditionary Planning Tool for automated 
aircraft parking plans may be helpful. For aircraft characteristics and parking 
information, refer to UFC 3-260-01 or the aircraft manual for the specific aircraft. 
 
4.3.9.1. Start aircraft pavement expansions as soon as additional requirements are 
evident; otherwise, a massive backlog of aircraft flows and serious congestion in 
materiel and asset movement on the ground may occur. Pavement expansion 
could also be required to park incoming deployed aircraft. Contact wing 
operations during the site planning process to obtain the probable numbers and 
types of expected aircraft. Coordinate aircraft parking plans with maintenance 
personnel. If more parking positions are necessary, consider construction 
techniques identified in next paragraph. 
 
4.3.9.2. Expanded parking areas can be constructed next to existing aircraft 
pavements using expedient techniques such as graded and compacted earth, 
compacted crushed stone or AM-2 matting over a compacted subbase. Once 
primarily for rapid runway crater repairs, AM-2 matting is now often used to 
repair or expand aircraft parking areas and as warehouse floors. Refer to TSPWG 
M 3-270-01.3-270-07, for more information on AM-2 matting assembly and 
installation. 
 
4.3.10. Access Roads and Drainages. Construction, maintenance, repair, and 
rehabilitation of access roads and drainages are critical to airfield operations. In 
essence, these roads are the installation’s arteries that support the flow of 
personnel and materials needed to accomplish the mission. Refer to UFC 3-260-
01 for additional information. 
 
4.3.10.1. Access Roads. At least one access road connecting the airfield with the 
existing road network is required. Bases with operations and service facilities on 
both sides of a runway should have a perimeter road connected to the access road. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
59 
 
Connect service roads to hardstands, the control tower, service areas, fuel storage 
and dispensing areas, munitions storage areas, and base camps. It may also be 
desirable to provide a turnaround loop to ease vehicle maneuvers around 
hardstands (including fuel storage and distribution areas). Below are other 
roadway concerns: 
 
4.3.10.1.1. General. Roads on airfields should not cross or be within the lateral 
clearance distance for runways, high-speed taxiways, and dedicated taxiways for 
alert pads. This prevents normal vehicular traffic from obstructing aircraft in 
transit. Roads should be located so surface vehicles will not be hazards to air 
navigation and navigational aids. 
 
4.3.10.1.2. Firefighting and Rescue Roadways. Firefighting and Rescue access 
roads shall provide unimpeded two-way access for firefighting vehicles and 
equipment to incident areas. When practical, connecting these access roads with 
airfield operational surfaces and other airfield roads will enhance Fire and 
Emergency Services operations. 
 
4.3.10.1.3. Fuel Truck Access. Fuel truck access points to aircraft parking aprons 
should be located so minimal disruptions and hazards to active aircraft movement 
occurs. Fuel truck access from aircraft areas to the fuel storage areas should be 
separate from other vehicular traffic. Bulk fuel, truck parking, and truck filling 
areas need to be as close to the flight line as is reasonably possible. 
 
4.3.10.1.4. Explosives and Munitions Transfer to Arm/Disarm Pads. Transfer of 
explosives and munitions from storage areas to arm/disarm pads should occur on 
dedicated transfer roads. Use transfer roads exclusively for explosives and 
munitions transfer vehicles. 
 
4.3.10.2. Drainages. Drainages should be constructed and maintained for all active 
roadways. Improperly channeled surface water can quickly undermine most 
roads, even when they are considered well-constructed. Pending or delayed 
surface water runoff can also seep into the pavement structure of paved roads if 
the road surface is not tightly sealed. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
60 
 
4.3.11. Road Design and Construction. Air Force engineers generally design and 
construct roads in the theater of operations to three standards: initial, temporary, 
or semi-permanent. During contingency operations, nearly all roads constructed 
meet temporary standards. In some rare cases, engineers build semi-permanent 
and permanent roads to support long-term operations. Initial and temporary roads 
are usually made of stabilized earth or gravel, while semi-permanent roads are 
typically made of asphalt with concrete turn pads. Generally, road construction 
consists of crowned driving surface and pavement structure, a shoulder area that 
slopes directly away from the driving surface to provide drainage off the driving 
surface, and side ditches for drainage away from the road itself (Figure 4.10). For 
detailed information related to flexible and rigid pavement designs, refer to UFC 
3-250-01FA, Pavement Design for Roads, Street, Walks, and Open Storage Areas, 
UFC 3-250-03, Standard Practice Manual for Flexible Pavements, and UFC 3-
250-04, Standard Practice for Concrete Pavements.

4.4. Revetment and Soil Berm Construction. Revetments and berms are simple 
and sometimes low-tech solutions that can satisfy certain protective construction 
requirements around airfields. Primarily, these structures protect and shield vital 
facilities, equipment, and other resources; suppress noise; control spills; limit 
access; or support waste management activities in the theater of operations. 
 
4.4.1. Revetments. At contingency airbases, using revetments for force protection 
purposes is a routine option. These walls or barriers are routinely constructed 
using soil-filled wire and fabric containers, prefabricated concrete barriers, or 
metal bins. However, they may also be constructed using sandbags, wooden bins, 
sand grids, plastic bins, and various other expedient methods. Preliminary 
construction plans should include the locations for the revetments, their 
configuration, and a source (on-base quarry or off-base vendor) for revetment fill 
material. Consult GTA 90-01-011 (JFOB7 Handbook), UFC 4-022-02, Selection 
and Application of Vehicle Barriers, T.O. 35E4-170-2-WA-1, Assembly and 
Erection Instructions, Aircraft Revetment, Type B-1, and AFTTP 3-32.34V3, Civil 
Engineer Expeditionary Force Protection, for more information on constructing 
revetments. 
 
4.4.2. Soil Berms. Soil or earthen berms have a wide range of uses at contingency 
airfields. They provide force protection as base perimeters, defensive fighting 
positions, traffic control barriers, or facility hardening. They also provide safety 
barriers for landfills, burn pits, hazardous materials storage sites, and for noise 
abatement and spill protection, among other things. Refer to GTA 90-01-011 
(JFOB7 Handbook), UFC 4-022-02, AFTTP 3-32.34V3, and AFTTP 3-32.33V2, 
Expedient Roads, Drainage, and Protective Structures, for more information on 
berm construction. 
 
4.5. Fuel Dikes. Referred to as either fuel dikes or fuel berms, these structures 
contain spills if tanks or bladders rupture or catch fire. They also act as a safety 
barrier and base defense measure (Figure 4.11). Engineers tasked to build fuel 
dikes should work closely with logistics (fuels) specialists responsible for the 
design and operation of fuel distribution systems. Consider the following when 
constructing dikes for Fuels Support Equipment refueling units: 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
62 
 
Figure 4.11. Fuel Dikes Control Spills and Forms Protective Barrier. 
 
 
 
4.5.1. The site should be reasonably level and well drained to prevent water 
damage. Avoid low areas to prevent danger of vapor collection. Also, avoid 
placing the site in low hill areas, rolling country, uphill, or upstream from other 
installations that would be in the path of escaping fuel. It should also be free of 
rocks and obstructions. The ground should be as level as possible with a maximum 
slope of three degrees to prevent the tank from creeping or crawling. Avoid low 
areas to prevent accumulation of trapped vapors. Give careful attention to 
receiving capabilities, such as rail cars, taxiways, and roads. 
 
4.5.2. The size or height of fuel dikes should be able to contain the volume of 
liquid in the fuel bladder within the dike should a rupture occur. Consider adding 
secondary dikes around the primary dike to catch residual or accidental leakage 
and spillage due to hose/coupling breaks. If secondary dikes are used, the berm 
liner should be long enough to cover the secondary dike. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
63 
 
4.5.3. When setting up a bladder area, ensure all areas are within reach using a 
fire-fighting vehicle with a top turret throw range of 175 feet. Minimum distance 
between bladder storage areas should not exceed 150 feet. Roads built around fuel 
dikes should permit fuel trucks (fueling and de-fueling) to travel over the ground 
adjacent to the dike. Refer to AFPAM 23-221, Fuels Logistics Planning, and T.O. 
37A12-15-1, Collapsible Fuel Bladders, for other fuel dike or berm construction 
details. 
 
4.6. Ditches. During development of initial contingency locations, ditches are a 
common expedient method to enhance or establish drainage around the 
installation’s roads, airfield, and facilities, but they are also useful as an anti-
vehicle barrier to stop vehicles from penetrating the base’s perimeter. For 
additional ditch construction information, refer to UFC 3-260-01, UFC 4-022-02, 
and GTA 90-01-011 (JFOB Handbook).

SHELTERS AND SUPPORT FACILITIES  
 
5.1. General Information. During wartime or other contingency operations, 
adequate beddown facilities are essential for deployed forces. Civil engineers help 
provide the required infrastructure to support planned operations and ensure an 
ample quality of life for base residents. Facilities erected at bare bases should meet 
certain theater construction standards. Joint Publication 3-34, Joint Engineer 
Operations, emphasize that Combatant Commanders, in coordination with 
Service components and the Services, specify contingency construction standards 
in the theater of operation. A good resource for contingency construction 
standards and non-permanent facility and utility designs is the Joint Construction 
Management System (JCMS). The JCMS provides specifications, standard 
drawings, bills of material, man-hour estimates, and other data for many structures 
used by the AF and other Services to beddown forces during contingencies. It 
includes designs for initial structures with an expected life of up to 180 days and 
temporary facilities with an expected life of up to two years. Consider using the 
JCMS whenever possible to reduce and streamline wartime design and 
procurement efforts. 
 
5.2. Contingency Construction Standards in Theater. Generally, beddown or 
bare base construction standards fall into three categories: organic, initial, and 
temporary construction standards. 
 
5.2.1. Organic. Organic construction uses host nation or unit organic equipment, 
facilities and labor to support deployments lasting up to 90 days. Since 
construction is time-consuming and often costly, the intent is to seek an alternative 
to new construction and use a minimum amount of labor and resources, until the 
arrival of the full engineer capability. Minimal or no land grading or site work, 
tents and pit latrines are examples of this standard. Although intended for use for 
up to 90 days, organic construction may be used for up to six months. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
65 
 
5.2.2. Initial. Initial construction is also characterized by relatively austere 
facilities and utilities that require minimal engineer effort. This construction is 
intended for use during the first six months of a contingency. Tents with flooring, 
latrines with sewage lift stations, tactical generators for electrical distribution and 
portable refrigeration are examples of this standard. BEAR assets are generally 
categorized as “initial” construction facilities. This connotation, however, does 
not mean they will be totally replaced after six months; but rather they will be 
used at the onset of a conflict. It is possible that some of these assets will last 
several years before needing replacement. 
 
5.2.3. Temporary. Temporary construction is characterized by facilities and 
utilities of a more substantial nature. It is used to increase efficiency and sustain 
operations for at least 24 months and with upgrades for up to 5 years. Wood frame 
buildings, bathhouses, commercial electric power and paved roads are examples 
of the temporary standard. 
 
5.3. Facility Assets and Preparation Actions. Successful BEAR facility erection 
depends on several actions being carried out prior to and during the arrival of 
personnel at a bare base. Some of the actions are easy to control, others not so 
much. The ones easily influenced include the degree of training the base populace 
has on erecting BEAR facilities, which in turn, could dictate how much 
involvement engineers will have in erecting facilities for other organizations, and 
the arrival timing and sequence of facility assets. Always make the best of your 
particular situation; for purposes of this publication, assume the base populace is 
generally knowledgeable in facility erection and assets flow into the base in a 
reasonable manner. 
 
5.3.1. It is doubtful many people at a bare base will be able to identify all the 
various BEAR facility and utility components as they arrive. Consequently, 
engineers will have to accomplish this task since it is an engineer responsibility 
to place most of these items in service. Supply personnel deployed in support of 
BEAR help expedite assets as BEAR items arrive. These asset expediters will 
assist aerial port personnel in identifying equipment, arrange to have engineer-
related items moved from the ramp area to the job site or interim holding area and 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
66 
 
maintain asset accountability. If a supply representative from the 635th Materiel 
Maintenance Group is available, they may be able to help identify BEAR assets 
as they arrive and assist in maintaining accountability. 
 
5.3.2. Identify a reasonably large open storage area immediately upon arrival at a 
bare base for temporary storage and eventual longer-term storage for shipping 
containers. As facility and utility assets are off loaded, separate them by type of 
system or building and moved to the holding area or work site if needed at the 
time. Any forklift-qualified personnel can assist in moving items if necessary. 
Plan to have most BEAR facilities delivered to the engineer holding area, then to 
their final location for erection by user personnel as they arrive. Arrange with base 
supply personnel to consolidate all the shipping and storage containers once 
empty. If arrangements with supply personnel cannot be made early in the 
deployment, plan on initially storing these containers in the engineer holding area. 
 
5.3.3. While assets are off loaded from incoming aircraft or vehicles, site layout 
and site preparation should be well underway. Try to have enough heavy 
equipment operators on the job so as not to fall way behind the site layout crews. 
Obviously, this tactic is dependent on equipment availability and the number of 
other heavy equipment tasks ongoing; however, the speed of facility erection 
directly relates to the degree of site preparation completed. If the terrain is 
relatively level, the site preparation task should go faster, if terrain is irregular, 
size the heavy equipment support accordingly. Look to contract support to fill 
heavy equipment gaps. 
 
5.3.4. As site layout and preparations continue, begin delivering assets to the job 
sites; plan on doing this with engineer forces. Have someone use the site layout 
plan and a general list of facility allocations to oversee this effort. 
 
5.4. BEAR Facilities. BEAR shelters and other structures are vital to beddown, 
standup, and support our forces at expeditionary locations regardless of the 
availability of local infrastructure and support facilities. Although the Air Force 
continually upgrade, modify, and improve BEAR facilities, bare base beddown 
typically use a mixture of current and legacy structures and support equipment. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
67 
 
5.4.1. Small and Medium Sized Shelters. Virtually all functional areas receive 
BEAR shelters like the Small Shelter System, so delivery of these assets should 
be reasonably straightforward. On the other hand, use of the Medium Shelter 
System is unique to certain areas, so carefully apportion those assets as necessary. 
Deliver shelter assets as close as possible to final locations to prevent moving 
them later. Pick up empty ship/store containers when returning to the holding area 
after delivering assets. This keeps the base less cluttered and protects containers 
from damage or misuse. 
 
5.4.2. Large Shelters. Generally, users do not erect large shelters. Prime BEEF or 
RED HORSE teams, with support from the 635th Materiel Maintenance Group 
large structures team erect large shelters, including the dome shelter, large area 
maintenance shelter, and the frame supported tension fabric shelter. These 
specialized teams can handle the movement, unpacking, and erection of these 
larger facilities since they have the requisite training and skills. 
 
5.4.3. Miscellaneous and Legacy Shelters. Some miscellaneous and legacy 
shelters, potentially still in use, include the Expandable Light Air Mobile Shelter, 
General Purpose Shelter, Expandable Shelter Container, and the Aircraft Hangar. 
These assets remain a potential option for multiple purposes at deployed locations 
worldwide. 
 
5.4.4. From an engineer aspect, a basic premise of bare base development is that 
users will erect their own facilities, thereby freeing engineer personnel for other, 
more critical beddown tasks. This does not mean engineers provide no support at 
all for facility erection. Plan to erect all Medium Shelter Systems—these are 
probably too complex for most base organizations to handle. Plan to have a small 
cadre of personnel knowledgeable on erection techniques for Small Shelter 
Systems to assist the base populace. There will be occasions where untrained 
people are involved with facility erection tasks and engineers should be prepared 
to offer supervisory and instructional guidance. However, base populace should 
not attempt utility connections to facilities. The potential for damage to system 
components and harm to both base personnel and electrical crews is too great. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
68 
 
5.4.5. The facilities outlined in Table 5.1 support various base functional areas. 
However, senior personnel determine final facility allocation locally. Make sure 
the base and wing command staffs are involved. Refer to AFPAM 10-219V6 for 
details and descriptions of BEAR shelters.

5.5. Force Support Facilities. During bare base development, Force Support 
functions generally consist of kitchen, billeting, laundry, and mortuary facilities. 
While many of these facilities use Small Shelter System assets and erected by 
Force Support personnel, CE personnel erect the larger facilities, perform site 
preparation, connect utilities such as power, water, and sewage, and install some 
of the more complicated equipment items such as water heaters, walk-in 
refrigeration units and air conditioning units. 
 
5.5.1. Kitchens. Two types of kitchen packages are available for bare base 
development, the standard BEAR 9-2 Kitchen (550 personnel) and the Single 
Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen. 
 
5.5.1.1. The BEAR 550 kitchen is a complete portable food preparation and 
serving complex. It can serve up to 550 personnel and seat 120. When siting the 
facility, select a site approximately 200 feet by 100 feet that is relatively level, has 
good drainage, is free of rocks and underbrush, is sheltered from high winds, and 
accessible to the rest of the installation. If configuring two BEAR 550 kitchen 
facilities to serve up to 1100 personnel, select a site that is approximately 300 feet 
by 300 feet. Refer to T.O. 35E4-169-31-WA-1, Kitchen, Electric, Harvest 
Falcon/Eagle (Mess Kit Laundry Optional) Bare Base, for more information. 
 
5.5.1.2. The Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen is a complete food service 
facility inside an Expandable, Integrated Shipment Unit. It has a messing 
capability to feed hot meals to 500 personnel using Unitized Group Rations, not 
included. An accompanying Medium Shelter System provides seating for dining 
area and placement of Expandable, Integrated Shipment Unit. The Single Pallet 
Expeditionary Kitchen requires a clear, level area; ideally, the area underneath the 
container should be completely clear of obstructions and debris, and it should not 
be placed on any depressions or sharply raised areas. See T.O. 35E4-235-1-WA-
1, Operations and Maintenance Instructions w/IPB, Single Pallet Expeditionary 
Kitchen, for siting and assembly information. 
 
5.5.2. Billeting (Lodging). Billeting facilities generally utilize small and medium 
shelter systems from BEAR housekeeping packages for personnel shelter, 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
70 
 
showers and latrines, offices, laundries, and storage. However, in some instances, 
other shelters (including legacy assets) may be used. The bulk of personnel 
shelters are comprised of Small Shelter System assets. Site and erect these shelters 
as discussed earlier in this chapter. It is a good idea to obtain a listing of the 
lodging facility breakout from Force Support personnel before siting these 
facilities. The group breakout list identifies any personnel groups that should be 
within contiguous billeting blocks (examples: flight crews, officers, females, and 
foreign military). Table 5.2 lists typical breakout groups. The number of 
personnel planned for each group could affect the layout plan. Spacing and 
distance for these personnel shelters should be according to specifications in UFC 
4-410-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings.

5.5.3. Showers and Latrines. Portable shower and latrine facilities are included in 
BEAR housekeeping and flightline operations packages. Normally housed in 
Small Shelter Systems, site these facilities on a relatively level surface that is free 
of debris. Refer to T.O. 35E35-5-1, Field Deployable Latrine Assembly, 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
71 
 
T.O.35E35-4-1, Shower Facility Bare Base, and T.O. 35E35-3-1, Shave Stand 
Bare Base, for more information. The Expandable Bicon Shelter Hygiene System 
is replacing these hygiene facilities via attrition. 
 
5.5.3.1. During contingencies or in the early stages of bare base deployments, 
deployable shower and latrine kits may not be available. Additionally, even when 
BEAR assets begin to arrive, there may be locations on the base that need 
expedient latrine facilities due to the distances from main utility networks or 
inadequate quantities of deployable assets. Therefore, engineer support may be 
required to construct various types of field hygiene and sanitation facilities. 
 
5.5.3.2. Expedient facilities could include any of the following: latrines, urinals, 
hand-washing stations, and shower and shaving stations. Construct these facilities 
when no other practical options are available or permitted. Refer to AFH 10-
222V4, AFPAM 10-219V6, and AFTTP 3-32 Series for additional details on 
expedient hygiene and sanitation facilities. 
 
5.5.4. Self-Help Laundry. The self-help laundry is an efficient field laundry 
system designed for rapid deployment and continuous operation. The site selected 
for the laundry facility should be relatively level with adequate drainage. Laundry 
equipment requires approximately 75 square feet of space inside a small shelter 
system or legacy tent. Consult T.O. 50D1-4-1 or 50D1-4-11, Laundry, Self-Help, 
Bare Base, for more information. 
 
5.5.5. Mortuary. Commonly, field mortuary sites use a Small Shelter System for 
Mortuary Collection Point operations. The site also requires the Advanced Design 
Refrigerator, 300 Cubic Foot (ADR-300), or legacy 150-cubic foot refrigerators 
for refrigerated storage. The site and facility should be located away from other 
facilities. It may require a power generator if normal site power is not available 
during processing. The mortuary collection point should also have ample area 
lighting, a water supply, access for truck and forklift operations, good drainage 
and runoff protection, and ventilation. Depending on the location and 
temperatures, an environmental control unit may be necessary during processing. 
A contaminated waste collection point may also be necessary. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
72 
 
5.6. Non-BEAR Facilities. Non-BEAR facilities come in all shapes and sizes and 
from various sources. They may be special field-deployable medical systems, 
commercial-off-the-shelf items, deployable assets from other Services, locally 
manufactured structures, or pre-designed facilities built from the ground up using 
Class IV construction materials. Whatever the source, Prime BEEF forces are 
building and supporting bare base and force beddown facilities and structures 
around the world for Air Force, joint, combined, and multinational operations. 
 
5.6.1. Expeditionary Medical Support System Facilities. Expeditionary medical 
and dental facilities provide an essential resource to treat (and evacuate, if 
necessary) casualties under all conditions. These facilities generally utilize Small 
Shelter System or the Multipurpose Tent System; however, using other shelters 
may be an option. Expeditionary Medical Support Systems are expandable 
equipment packages that range from a basic, rapid response facility to an Air 
Force Theater Hospital. While medical personnel possess the training and 
experience to erect medical facilities, deployed civil engineers provide significant 
beddown support for these facilities. Expeditionary Medical Support System 
facilities require specific siting and utility requirements. Site medical units in 
lower threat areas of the base but as near as practical to force support facilities 
such as billeting, showers and laundry. In addition to performing site preparations 
and providing basic utilities like heat, electric, and water, engineers should also 
consider factors below: 
 
• 
Emergency back-up power needs 
• 
Oxygen and vacuum lines, if required 
• 
Refuse and medical waste disposal requirements 
• 
Room for possible expansion of medical treatment facilities 
• 
Adequate access roads 
• 
Areas for erection of a radio antenna/satellite 
• 
Location of latrines (should be in close proximity) 
• 
Flightline accessibility (incoming/outgoing aeromedical patients) 
 
5.6.2. Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Facilities. Procure commercial-off-the-shelf 
building systems when necessary to meet specific mission requirements. These 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
73 
 
facilities are usually frame, fabric, and/or steel structures, which may be set up 
rapidly, are cost effective, and generally have a life span that exceeds theater 
temporary construction standards. These facilities function as aircraft sunshades 
and hangars, maintenance buildings, warehouses, and other purposes. While 
commercial contractors may construct some of these, engineers will likely be 
required to maintain and repair these facilities. If the facilities are portable, like 
the aircraft sunshade in Figure 5.1, Prime BEEF personnel may be required to 
relocate these structures to satisfy operational requirements. 
 
Figure 5.1. Engineers Relocate Aircraft Sunshades. 
 
 
 
5.6.3. Force Provider Facilities and Equipment. Army beddown facilities and 
equipment (referred to as Force Provider) will likely be encountered when 
deployed to a joint environment, and engineer work crews could be tasked to help 
beddown troops using these facilities. In some instances, work crews may need to 
complete site preparation, build access roads, and provide water and power to 
these facilities. In other situations, crews may be required to erect these facilities. 
Force Provider assets are similar to Air Force BEAR and legacy equipment assets, 
but there are some variations, and workers should review applicable technical 
manuals before erecting or maintaining these assets. As shown in Table 5.3, some 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
74 
 
examples where Force Provider assets differ from BEAR assets includes Army 
Prime Power and Air Force BEAR Power Unit, emergency power generators, 
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPUs), and latrine and shower 
units. In addition, there are some differences in the water distributions systems, 
field laundry configurations, and methods for collecting and treating gray water.

5.6.4. Pre-Designed Theater-Constructed Facilities. There are numerous, pre-
designed initial, temporary, and semi-permanent facilities intended for 
contingency operations outside the continental United States. They include 
barracks, latrines, administrative areas, hospitals, storage and distribution 
facilities, and many others. In today’s joint operations environment, Prime BEEF 
work crews often build these and other pre-designed structures (Figure 5.2). 
Engineering data for pre-designed, theater-constructed facilities is available in the 
Joint Construction Management System. The Joint Construction Management 
System offers design plans and provides two and three-dimensional drawings of 
various facilities. Additionally, a 360-degree animated fly-through of selected 
facilities is available so engineers can see what the structure looks like before it is 
constructed.

PEST MANAGEMENT 
 
6.1. General Information. Control of insects, rodents, and associated vermin is 
vital for force protection. These pests carry disease and quickly spread 
contamination throughout the airbase if left uncontrolled. The civil engineer pest 
management team performs critical tasks that help preserve the health and welfare 
of deployed forces. Primarily, they provide entomological services to rid an 
installation of pests and help maintain a healthy work and rest environment under 
austere conditions (Figure 6.1). This task includes more than the sensible use of 
pesticides, but rather a comprehensive, integrated pest management program. The 
integrated pest management approach combines a variety of techniques—
including physical, mechanical, educational, biological and chemical—to prevent 
medical injury or economic damage from pests and disease vectors.

6.2. Guidance and Resources. AFMAN 32-1053, Integrated Pest Management 
Program, implements Department of Defense and Air Force pest management 
policies, it generally applies to Air Force installations in the United States and its 
territories. For overseas contingency operations, theater-specific guidance 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023

applies. Combatant Command policy and requirements may be available in the 
environmental annex of the Operations Plan and/or Order. The Armed Forces Pest 
Management Board is also an important resource. It provides, collects, stores, and 
disseminates published and unpublished information on arthropod vectors and 
pests, natural resources, and environmental biology important to the Department 
of Defense. Other products include technical guides and country- or region-
specific Disease Vector Ecology Profiles, like that illustrated in Figure 6.2 for 
Afghanistan and the South Central Asia region. The Armed Forces Pest 
Management Board Technical Guide No. 24, Contingency Pesticide Usage 
Guide, provides basic information on using pesticides to control insects that 
transmit disease and for other pests encountered during field situations worldwide. 
While some information from Technical Guide-24 is available here, personnel 
should go to the Armed Forces Pest Management Board web site at 
https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/technicalguides.html for this and other 
contingency-related entomological information.

6.3. Safety. When working with pesticides and pest management equipment, 
safety is paramount. A dangerous temptation during contingency operations is to 
relax safety requirements. Some people think, “The rules don’t apply here.” 
Yielding to that temptation can cost you your health and the health of those around 
you. Table 6.1 lists general safety requirements and precautions to observe. 
 
Table 6.1. General Pest Management Safety Checks. 
 
Item or Activity 
Are pesticides only used as part of an integrated pest management program? 
Is proper PPE on hand and utilized in accordance with pesticide label? 
Do workers adhere to safety requirements and restrictions on pesticide 
labels?  
Do workers follow all directions, restrictions, and warnings for protecting 
the general population and non-target organisms? 
Are empty pesticide containers rendered “UNUSABLE” and properly 
disposed as per label? 
 
6.4. Sanitation. Good sanitation and proper waste disposal under contingency 
conditions are the most important principals in combating diseased pests such as 
filth flies and rodents. Even in mobile field situations, these pests have historically 
amplified sanitation problems, often causing epidemics of diarrheal diseases. This 
threat is even greater in urban areas converted to temporary or semi-permanent 
military use because personnel will not move every day to a different, cleaner 
area. In this situation, cockroaches may join other pests associated with poor 
sanitation in compounding the problem, especially in and around structures used 
for food storage, preparation and consumption, and buildings used for troop 
housing. All these pests should be controlled, but only in conjunction with efforts 
to correct the sanitation problems that provide them food, breeding areas, and 
shelter. Successful pest control requires good sanitation practices be established 
and maintained. You cannot control pests with pesticides alone. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
79 
 
6.5. Contingency Pesticides. As previously addressed, the ideal means of pest 
control is good sanitation and proper disposal of waste materials and garbage. 
Sometimes that may not be enough to control the pest population, and 
extermination may be required. Control insects by spraying an insecticide in and 
around nesting and feeding areas and fogging or spraying throughout the 
installation. Control rodents with poison baits, trapping, and sealing access points. 
The pesticides found on the Armed Forces Pest Management Board contingency 
pesticide list are suitable for contingency use by one or more of the military 
Services. A current list is available on the Armed Forces Pest Management Board 
web site at https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/. 
 
6.5.1. Using Pesticides in Foreign Countries. Different rules concerning the 
application of pesticides may apply in areas outside the jurisdiction of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. The Department of Defense follows 
applicable international agreements, other DoD Directives and Instructions as 
appropriate and environmental annexes incorporated into operation plans or 
operation orders. For North Atlantic Treaty Organization operations, 
Standardization Agreement 2048, Chemical Methods of Insect and Rodent 
Control, lists pesticides approved for use by member nations. See Armed Forces 
Pest Management Board Technical Guide-24 for additional guidance on use of 
pesticides during contingencies. 
 
6.5.2. Pesticide Storage. Isolate pesticide storage areas from congested areas for 
reasons of health and safety, fire protection, environmental protection, and 
security, if possible. The most compelling reason for the isolation of pesticide 
storage facilities is the fire safety. If a fire occurs in a facility located within or 
adjacent to an office complex, extensive decontamination of nearby areas from 
drift of toxic vapors, smoke, liquids, and particulates is required. Designated 
pesticide storage areas are essential to safely protect and store pesticides and 
related chemicals. See Armed Forces Pest Management Board Technical Guide-
24 for additional guidance. 
 
6.5.3. Emergency Procurement of Pesticides/Pest Management Equipment. 
Deploying forces often need pesticides and equipment on short notice. The 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
80 
 
Defense Logistics Agency has established an Emergency Supply Operations 
Center to provide equipment and supplies to deploying forces with urgent 
requirements and in a timely manner. Use the contact information in Table 6.2. 
The most current list of pesticide dispersal and surveillance equipment is available 
on the https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/. All items may be suitable for 
contingency use by one or more of the military Services. The list contains the 
most current products and prices.

6.5.4. Department of Defense Pesticide Hotline. The Department of Defense 
Pesticide Regulatory Action System provides the pesticide hotline service as a 
Department of Defense-wide source for all pesticide-related information and 
enables Department of Defense personnel to obtain information on pesticide 
labels, Materiel Safety Data Sheets, recent pesticide regulatory actions, and 
pesticide use and disposal information. Pre-deployment units can utilize this 
service to determine the current availability of approved pesticides in the military 
supply system and to receive recommendations on the availability and suitability 
of non-standard pesticides for use in the deployed areas. Contact the Department 
of Defense Pesticide Hotline at (410) 436-3773, Defense Switched Network: 584-
3773, Email at pesticide.hotline@amedd.army.mil. 
 
6.6. Transporting Pesticides. Vehicles used to transport pesticides should be 
single use vehicles and clearly identified as vector control vehicles. Do not 
transport food, water, or medical supplies in vehicles not designated for single 
use. Maintain vehicles in a clean and orderly appearance, free from observable 
pesticide spills, or residues. Vehicles used to transport pesticides will be equipped 
with a fire extinguisher and a spill kit capable of handling the maximum amount 
of pesticide transported at any given time. 
 
6.7. Department of Defense Repellents. The best strategy for defense against 
disease-bearing arthropods includes the application of extended-duration DEET 
(chemical name, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) lotion to exposed skin, coupled 
with the application of permethrin to the field uniform. When used with a properly 
worn uniform, this system will provide nearly complete protection from 
arthropod-borne diseases. Additional information on repellents and their 
application is available in the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Technical 
Guide-36, “Personal Protection Measures against Insects and Other Arthropods 
of Military Significance.” 
 
6.8. Controlling Vegetation with Herbicides. There are specific limits imposed 
on the use of herbicides during wartime and peacetime, inside and outside the 
United States. According to Executive Order 11850, Renunciation of Certain 
Uses in War of Chemical Herbicides and Riot Control Agents, 8 April 1975, the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
82 
 
United States has renounced first-use of herbicides in war except under 
regulations applicable to their domestic use on bases or for control of vegetation 
around the immediate defensive perimeters of bases. Only the President of the 
United States may authorize other wartime uses. Make sure any use of herbicides 
is according to established procedures and limits.

CONTINGENCY WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS 
 
7.1. General Information. Establishing a viable water and wastewater system is 
essential to the success of deployed military operations. It has a direct impact on 
the health, welfare, and morale of the troops. The Air Force’s contingency water 
system (BEAR Water System) can fulfill water purification, potable water 
distribution, and wastewater recovery needs at austere locations. This chapter 
briefly addresses water consumption planning factors, water system sighting and 
layout, and an overview of the contingency water system. In addition to the 
information addressed here, CE Airmen should refer to T.O. 40W4-21-1, Basic 
Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Water System, T.O. 40W4-20-1-WA-
1, 1500 Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), AFH 10-222V11, 
AFH 10-222V4, Environmental Considerations for Overseas Contingency 
Operations and UFC 3-240-01, Wastewater Collection and Treatment, for 
information on contingency water and wastewater treatment systems. Consult the 
Bioenvironmental Engineering flight when designing and developing drinking 
water systems and processes. Bioenvironmental engineering personnel have an 
instrumental role in accessing drinking water quality, treatment, and vulnerability. 
 
7.2. Water Source Development and Water Production. Water sources have a 
significant impact on water system development. For example, is the source fresh 
water, brackish, or salt water? Does it come from a well, river, lake, ocean, or 
municipal water supply? How far is the water source from the base? What is the 
water temperature? These factors determine how much effort and equipment is 
required to capture and treat the water during the initial beddown period. In some 
instances, work crews may need to clear a road to the water source, or an expedi-
ent water intake system may need to be set up. Even building a temporary dam to 
create an expedient reservoir could possibly be required. In any case, once the 
source and location are usable, install and use raw water pumps to retrieve the 
water. If the water production plant will not be located near the water source, it 
may be necessary to fill bladders, tanks, or other water vessels for transport to the 
site chosen for the water. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
84 
 
 
7.2.1. Water supplied during deployments and at contingency locations must meet 
military field water standards (MFWS) in Air Force Manual 48-138_IP and re-
quired by Joint Publication (JP) 4-03, Bulk Petroleum and Water Doctrine. These 
standards are applicable to military- and contractor-operated water purification 
systems and apply to treated drinking water whether it is in storage; distributed 
by pipes, vehicles, or trailers; or packaged and distributed by military or contrac-
tor systems and personnel. 
 
7.2.2. Providing essential water to support the anticipated base population and 
projected mission is a priority-1 task. Complicating the situation somewhat is the 
fact that the entire contingency water system package is unlikely to arrive at one 
time early in the deployment. An initial water production package (consisting of 
two ROWPUs, storage bladders, pumps, hoses, fittings, and power source for 
standalone operation) is usually the first BEAR water production items received. 
If the source water is located over 500 feet from the anticipated water production 
location, a Source Run subsystem package may also be included with the initial 
water package. Take immediate steps to develop water sources, set up water pro-
duction, and set up potable water storage bladders. Later, additional BEAR water 
system assets should arrive to enable installation of a complete water plant, dis-
tribution, and wastewater collection system. 
 
7.2.3. Water Operations Area (WOA) Site. Wherever the camp is located, there 
should be enough real estate outside the camp placement area to allow for the 
Water Operations Area. The WOA is an area identified for the Dual Water Pump 
Station, Water Tank Farm, and Water Production subsystems. Site the WOA on 
terrain that is relatively flat and free of debris. Table 7.1 provides WOA 
dimensions and the quantity of water production subsystems required based upon 
camp population. Figure 7.1 illustrates location for a WOA in relation to the camp 
facilities layout area.

7.3. Water Planning Factors. 
 
7.3.1. Consumption. Anticipated water consumption is usually based on the size 
of the deployed force and its consumption requirements. Joint Publication 4-03, 
Joint Bulk Petroleum and Water Doctrine, describes essential water requirements 
as drinking, personal hygiene, field feeding, medical treatment, heat casualty 
treatment, personal contamination control, patient decontamination in CBRN en-
vironments and in arid regions, and vehicle and aircraft maintenance. When re-
quirements exceed production, reduce all but essential consumption. Where 
BEAR mobile assets (ROWPUs and associated distribution systems) are used ex-
clusively, the water-use planning factor should be about 30 gallons per person per 
day (gpppd). If a fixed or permanent water treatment plant along with adequate 
water storage facilities is provided at the beddown location, consider using a 60-
gpppd planning factor. Listed in Table 7.2 is a breakdown of the 30-/60-gpppd 
planning factor.

7.3.2. Wastewater Estimates. Often, we view potable water as the most essential 
element to bare base operations, and the disposal of wastewater and other wastes 
seems to be of lesser importance. On the contrary, unless we dispose of all types 
of wastes quickly and properly, unsanitary conditions quickly develop. Flies, 
mosquitoes, and rodents can overwhelm a developing base, spreading disease 
with them. Of the 30 gpppd of potable/non-potable water provided at a bare base 
for initial beddown, approximately 21 gpppd (70 percent) will become 
wastewater. For an estimated 60 gpppd of potable/non-potable water, about 42 
gpppd will become wastewater. 
 
7.3.3. Wastewater Disposal. Water usage generally results in wastewater that 
requires disposal. The volume of wastewater alone can cause significant problems 
in the field, and depending on the source, wastewater may also contain suspended 
solids and particulate matter, organic material, dissolved salts, biological and 
pathogenic organisms, and even toxic chemicals. In any case, proper wastewater 
disposal is essential to protect the health of the force. Deployed units should 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
88 
 
comply with DODI 4715.22 and the Environmental Annex of the 
OPLAN/OPORD and follow other applicable theater-specific procedures and 
guidance for wastewater disposal. Consider the following options: 
 
7.3.3.1. Connection to an established installation sanitary sewer system. 
 
7.3.3.2. Collection and retention of wastewater for engineer/contractor removal to 
a fixed treatment facility. 
 
7.3.3.3. Engineer construction of semi-permanent wastewater collection and 
disposal systems. 
 
7.3.3.4. Use of a field expedient wastewater disposal system, if available. 
 
7.4. BEAR Water System. The BEAR contingency water system provides water 
to support kitchens, latrines, showers, laundries, and other bare base facilities and 
recovers the wastewater for appropriate disposal. The water system consists of 
five distinct subsystems: Source Run, Water Production, Initial Distribution, 
Follow-on Distribution, and Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension 
subsystems. The water system is modular in design and scalable to meet a variety 
of user deployment needs. Work crews have the flexibility to configure the 
subsystems to meet their unit’s specific needs. The wastewater disposal elements 
of the BEAR water system use a similar concept as a typical municipal wastewater 
system. The system collects and transports wastewater to a centralized treatment 
area via hose or pipe, where it receives the equivalent of secondary treatment 
subsequent to discharge for disposal. Setting up the BEAR water system takes 
time and until it is operational, pick up the wastewater at the point of generation 
using wastewater removal trailers.  Discharge the waste away from the base or 
into a lagoon system, if one is available. The following paragraphs provide an 
overview of each BEAR water subsystem. See T.O. 40W4-21-1 and AFTTP 3-
32-Series for a detailed description of these subsystems. 
 
7.4.1. Source Run Subsystem. The Source Run Subsystem provides raw water 
input (source water) for the contingency water system. It can pull water from a 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
89 
 
raw water source (i.e., river, lake, sea, or ocean) up to 100 feet away and 20 feet 
below the pumping station. The Source Run Subsystem can pump source water 
up to a distance of 6000 feet and to a height of 150 feet to a raw water storage 
tank. 
 
7.4.2. Water Production Subsystem. The Water Production Subsystem generates 
potable water for distribution to user facilities within the contingency water 
system. Generally, bases accomplish water purification using 1500 ROWPUs set 
up in a parallel configuration. Distribution of potable water generated by the 
ROWPUs is through another series of hoses and fittings to 20,000-gallon potable 
water storage tanks. 
 
7.4.3. 550-Initial Subsystem. The 550-Initial Subsystem (550-I) is the primary 
distribution subsystem of the contingency water system. Bases can use the 550-I 
as a stand-alone distribution subsystem; but its purpose is for expansion and 
buildup to meet varying user deployment and operational needs.  
 
7.4.3.1. The 550-I subsystem normally receives potable water input from the 
Water Production Subsystem. However, supplied adapters also provide a means 
to draw water from other similar potable water sources. As illustrated in Figure 
7.2, potable water input to the subsystem is stored in three 20,000-gallon fabric 
storage tanks. The water in the tanks runs to the camp via a dual pumping station 
and potable water distribution hoses. Similarly, various wastewater lines and lift 
pumps collects and distributes wastewater output from user facilities for disposal.

7.4.3.2. In the layout shown in Figure 7.3, all wastewater runs to a 25,000-gallon 
wastewater collection tank. In another configuration (Figure 7.4), only 
wastewater from latrines and kitchens go to the wastewater tank. The remaining 
wastewater (graywater) from showers and laundries go to graywater drying beds.

7.4.4. 550-Follow-On Water Distribution Subsystem. The 550-Follow-On 
Subsystem (550-F) expands and builds off the 550-I subsystem; it is not intended 
to function alone. When used as an expansion to the 550-I subsystem, this system 
functions identically to the 550-I. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
93 
 
 
7.4.5. Industrial Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem. The Industrial 
Operations and Flightline Extension Subsystem is a potable water expansion 
subsystem for the 550-Initial, 550-Follow-On, or Water Production Subsystems. 
The extension subsystem can branch off any part of the 3-inch pressurized feed 
line from these systems and can supply potable water to isolated user facilities 
such as latrines, showers, and kitchens. Additionally, hose rollover protection 
ramps (hose bridges) safeguard hoses in the event potable water distribution lines 
need to cross roadways or similar heavy vehicular traffic areas. 
 
7.5. Expedient Wastewater Disposal Methods. The following paragraphs 
provide a brief description of common expedient wastewater disposal methods, 
including evaporation beds, seepage pits, soakage pits and trenches, sewage 
lagoons, and leach fields. Information relating to the construction and use of these 
methods is available in UFC 3-240-01, AFTTP 3-32.33V1, Expedient Hygiene, 
Water and Waste Methods, and theater-specific guidance. Additional information 
on wastewater disposal during contingency operations is provided in AFH 10-
222V4. See Attachment 7 for the pros and cons of various expedient wastewater 
disposal methods, including special considerations for disposal facilities in desert 
environments. 
 
7.5.1. Evaporation Beds. Contingency bases may use evaporation beds (aka 
drying beds) to dispose of graywater from shower and laundry facilities in hot, 
dry climates and in locations where clay soil prevents the use of standard soakage 
pits. Generally, expedient evaporation beds measure 8 by 10 feet, although larger 
evaporation fields may be necessary to handle greater amounts of graywater. 
 
7.5.2. Seepage Pits. Seepage pits also disposes of wastewater efficiently. The 
required size of a seepage pit can be determined from a percolation test and the 
estimated amount of effluent from the facility. Several smaller pits for a facility 
may be more feasible than one large pit. When more than one pit is used, ensure 
there is equal distribution of the wastewater to all the pits. The pits should be 
located outside the base camp and at least 100 feet from the nearest water source. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
94 
 
7.5.3. Kitchen Soakage Pits and Trenches. Prior to installation of the BEAR water 
system, wastewater from kitchens can be disposed of using a kitchen soakage pit 
or trench. Consider using soakage trenches when the groundwater level or a rock 
formation precludes digging a soakage pit. 
 
7.5.4. Grease Traps. There are many types and variations of expedient grease 
traps. Typically, they are necessary for kitchen soakage pits and trenches to 
prevent premature clogging. Personnel usually place the trap directly over the 
soakage pit or on a platform with a trough leading to the pit; sometimes, users 
embed the grease trap within the soakage pit. 
 
7.5.5. Sewage Lagoons. Sewage lagoons are common throughout the world. 
Although easy to construct, sewage lagoons are not a recommended theater 
practice. If used, sewage lagoons should be located at least one-half mile from the 
population center because of the odors produced by anaerobic digestion. The 
increased length of the sewer collection system, compounded by the possible need 
for automatic lift stations, significantly increases the materiel cost and 
construction effort required for a complete system. 
 
7.5.6. Leach Fields. Use leach fields (also termed “absorption fields”) in 
conjunction with septic tank treatment as the final treatment and disposal process 
for the septic system. Leach fields normally consist of perforated distribution 
pipes laid in trenches or beds filled with rock. The perforated pipes distribute the 
septic tank effluent and allow it to percolate through the ground. This percolation 
process filters and treats the effluent by naturally occurring bacteria and oxygen. 
Once released from the septic tank, the effluent travels by gravity through a solid 
Polyvinyl Chloride pipe to the distribution box. The distribution box is a 
reinforced concrete structure that distributes the septic tank effluent evenly 
throughout the absorption field through several 4-inch diameter perforated pipes.

ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
8.1. General Information. Developing a bare base electrical power generation 
and distribution system is a two-phase approach. The first phase is to provide 
initial power via tactical power generators to those functions critical to initial base 
operation. The second and much more complex phase is to establish primary 
power plants and install the overall base electrical distribution network. It is 
advantageous to have multi-skilled, and forklift qualified, electrical systems and 
electrical power production personnel to enable the expeditious, independent, and 
concurrent completion of these phases. Ensure personnel wear appropriate PPE 
(including arc flash protection), as required in UFC 3-560-01. Install noise hazard 
and high voltage warning signs where appropriate. 
 
 
 
8.2. Tactical Power Generators. During the initial base planning and layout 
stages, precisely identify the locations of mission-critical facilities that require 
immediate tactical power generator support. In most instances, these facilities will 
also require fulltime standby or backup power generators; AFMAN 32-1062, 
Electrical Systems, Power Plants and Generators, identifies standby and backup 
power authorizations. Typical authorized facilities include command and control 
facilities, air traffic control towers, feeding facility, water plant, communication 
facilities, and other mission-essential facilities. The Wing Commander has final 
authority to determine which facilities receive dedicated generator support. Once 
facility selection is complete, electrical power-production personnel determine 
the appropriate size generator for each facility. Almost without fail, there will be 
more facilities requiring dedicated generator support than there are generators. 
WARNING 
Working on energized electrical equipment is prohibited except 
in rare circumstances, and then only when justified and approved 
by the Base Civil Engineer or equivalent in accordance with 
AFMAN 32-1065, Grounding & Electrical Systems.

One way to overcome this problem is to feed multiple facilities from a centrally 
located secondary distribution center (SDC) that is power by a single generator. 
Attempt to place SDCs in positions where they can eventually integrate into the 
primary distribution network without having to relocate them. After erecting 
facilities, electrical personnel connect the secondary service to the facility 
distribution panels when appropriate. Once tactical power generators are online, 
specifically designate personnel to accomplish regularly scheduled operational 
checks, recurring maintenance, and establish a refueling plan with base fuels 
personnel. Anticipate that tactical power generators will provide power between 
10 and 15 days—it may take that long to install and energize the base electrical 
distribution grid. 
 
8.3. Prime Power Plants. Concurrent with installing tactical power generators, a 
team should setup prime power plants. This effort includes placing prime power 
generators (including BEAR Power Units and MEP-12s), installing and 
connecting fuel bladders, setting up control panels for remote operation, installing 
and connecting primary switching centers and installing grounding systems. Refer 
to T.O. 35C2-3-474-11-WA-1, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) 
Power Unit (BPU), when siting and installing BEAR Power Units. The BEAR 
Power Unit delivers a nominal voltage of 4160/2400 Volts Alternating Current at 
60 Hz and a nominal voltage of 3800/2200 Volts Alternating Current at 50 Hz. 
When installing and siting MEP-012A generators, refer to T.O. 35C2-3-474-1, 
Generator Set, Diesel Engine-Driven, Wheel-Mounted 750-KW, 3-Phase, 4-Wire, 
2200/3800 and 2400/4160 Volts. 
 
8.3.1. Centrally located high-voltage generators offer the most advantageous 
primary distribution system. However, in high threat areas, consider dispersing 
these generators between prime and slave power plant locations to improve 
survivability. Multiple power plants and primary distribution loops that 
interconnect these plants are especially critical in high-threat locations. If a power 
plant becomes inoperative for any reason, energize the electrical grid using the 
remaining power plant(s). 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
97 
 
8.3.2. Diesel generators produces hazardous noise levels so to prevent personnel 
injury, place the generators a sufficient distance from work or lodging facilities. 
If separation distances are an issue, install noise barriers or baffles. Concrete 
revetments and earthen berms have proven to be effective in this regard. However, 
be sure to maintain adequate airflow and safety clearances around the equipment. 
 
8.4. Electrical Power Distribution. The SDC is an integral part of BEAR 
electrical distribution. It is designed to receive regulated electrical power at 
2400/4160 Volts Alternating Current and transforms the power into 120/208 Volts 
Alternating Current. Following the site layout plan, electrical personnel place 
SDCs at their required locations and begin connecting the SDCs to primary 
switching centers at the power plants. 
 
8.4.1. After erecting facilities, crews make secondary distribution connections 
between the SDCs and power distribution panels in the facility, and the internal 
connections of equipment within facilities. 
 
8.4.2. For planning and installation purposes use the following “rules of thumb” 
regarding SDCs: 
 
8.4.2.1. Limit the load on each SDC circuit to 21.6 kVA. 
 
8.4.2.2. Limit the total load on each SDC to 150 kVA. 
 
8.4.2.3. Limit the number of shelters on a SDC to ten when using the Field-
Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU) in each shelter. 
 
8.4.2.4. Under normal operating loads, a power plant with at least two generators 
operating will support 6 to 10 SDCs per primary switching center circuit when 
facilities have FDECUs (Figure 8.1), and 10 to 15 SDCs per primary switching 
center circuit when facilities do not have FDECUs. 
 
8.4.3. Several remote area lighting sets are included in BEAR unit type codes 
(UTCs), and most should arrive relatively early in the overall asset flow. Powered 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
98 
 
by SDCs, Remote Area Lighting Systems support area lighting requirements for 
functions such as aerial port offloading, aircraft maintenance, POL transfer and 
security of critical assets. Be prepared to provide electrical support to these 
lighting systems as soon as they come online. Refer to T.O. 35F5-5-22-1 to site, 
install, and operate these systems. 
 
Figure 8.1. Typical SDC/Facility Configuration with FDECUs. 
 
 
 
8.4.4. Site facilities and SDCs to optimize to the number of facilities each SDC 
serves. Up to a maximum of 10 facilities with FDECUs or up to 16 without air 
conditioners as long as the total load does not exceed 150 kVA per SDC and the 
length of secondary cable runs (shorter is generally better, ideally no more than 
150 feet). Refer to T.O. 35CA2-2-17-1-WA-1, Operation and Maintenance 
Manual, Secondary Distribution Center (SDC) 150 KVA (DPGDS), for additional 
SDC installation and siting instructions. 
 
8.4.5. When initially laying prime power (high voltage) electrical cable, if soil 
conditions or time and equipment constraints prevent its immediate burial, the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
99 
 
Base Civil Engineer may make an operational risk management decision to leave 
some or all of the high-voltage cable on the surface initially. If that is the case, 
take measures to mitigate the risk of personnel injury or damage to the cables. As 
a minimum, bury or otherwise protect cables crossing roads and high-traffic 
walkways. Bring the base onto the electrical grid in stages as the population 
increases and functional area activities dictate. Whenever the primary electrical 
grid can pick up facilities served by tactical power generators, reconfigure these 
units as standby or backup power. Obviously, as the primary power plants 
energized, devote a portion of electrical power production crews to plant 
operations and maintenance. Once the electrical generation and distribution 
system is fully installed and operational, bury all aboveground primary power 
electrical cables (Figure 8.2). See AFTTP 3-32.34V5 for detailed information on 
power generation and distribution during base development at austere locations.

SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL 
 
9.1. General Information. Disposing of solid waste at contingency locations can 
be challenging. The goal is to dispose of solid waste in an environmentally 
acceptable manner consistent with good sanitary engineering principles and still 
accomplish the unit mission. Information sources for solid waste management 
principles, requirements, and methods include DODI 4715.19, Use of Open-Air 
Burn Pits during Contingency Operations, DODI 4715.22, Environmental 
Management Policy for Contingency Locations, AFI 32-7001, Environmental 
Management, AFMAN 32-7002, Environmental Compliance and Pollution 
Prevention, UFC 3-240-05A, Solid Waste Incineration, UFC 3-240-11, Landfills 
in Support of Military Operations, and AFH 10-222V4. However, engineers 
should follow theater-specific waste management guidance and procedures. 
 
9.2. Basic Guidelines. Disposal of solid waste is dependent on the location and 
surrounding environment. Some bases use host-nation or local contractors to 
dispose of solid waste; some use on-site facilities, and others use a combination 
of these methods. Whatever method the installation uses, attempt to minimize the 
amount of solid waste requiring disposal while still satisfying command 
requirements. Solid waste managers typically use the hierarchy in Table 9.1 when 
making waste diversion and disposal decisions. However, additional 
considerations may be necessary for overseas contingency operations. 
 
Table 9.1. Waste Diversion and Disposal Hierarchy. 
 
Waste Diversion and Disposal Hierarchy 
1 Source Reduction 
6 Incineration with Energy Recovery 
2 Reuse 
7 Incineration for Volume Reduction 
3 Donation 
8 Other Forms of Volume Reduction 
4 Recycling 
9 Landfill Disposal 
5 Composting/Mulching 
  
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
101 
 
9.2.1. Disposal methods should be thoroughly planned out and sited (collocated 
if necessary) for easy use. Waste collection areas should be downwind of base 
populated areas to prevent nuisance odors. 
 
9.2.2. Improper disposal of waste may contribute to environmental contamination, 
and accumulated waste could serve as a breeding ground for rodents and 
arthropods. If using on-base locations for garbage and refuse disposal, institute a 
stringent pest control program to alleviate the danger or spread of disease. Weigh 
all issues and alternatives before selecting the installation’s disposal methods. 
Consult DODI 4715.22 for more information. 
 
9.3. Waste Reduction and Disposal Methods. 
 
9.3.1. Recycling. Recycling is an effective means to reduce solid waste disposal 
streams. Solid waste like high-grade paper, plastic, cardboard, scrap metals, glass, 
wood cartons, pallets, used oil, tires, batteries, and more can be disposed of 
without burying or burning. Keep in mind, it may be necessary to purchase 
equipment or contract services to grind, compress, and bundle the recyclables for 
movement. Materials separated for recycling should be stored so they do not 
constitute a fire, health or safety hazard or provide food or harborage for vectors. 
They should also be contained or bundled to avoid spillage. 
 
9.3.2. Solid Waste Contractors. Using host-nation contractors can sometimes be 
the most practical approach to disposing of solid waste. Many expeditionary air 
bases are located at existing airports near towns and cities with large municipal 
solid waste disposal operations. While there are clear advantages to using a well-
established and proficient local contractor for waste disposal, use of host-nation 
workers could create security issues. Some installations may address these 
security issues by using military escorts and establish waste collection points 
outside of key areas. Others may establish a solid waste transfer station near a 
base entry point where contractors can pick up the waste, thereby denying their 
access to other areas of the base. The latter method, while more secure, requires 
significant resources and personnel for on-base waste collection before moving 
the solid waste to a transfer station. 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
102 
 
9.3.3. Composting. Another method of reducing solid waste, composting is an 
engineered process that promotes the biochemical decaying of organic material. 
During bare base development, a large percentage of the solid waste is packaging 
materials (such as cardboard, paper, and plastic), waste food, and sewage sludge. 
Although plenty of this material is biodegradable, it still presents a significant 
waste management challenge, especially in countries with few modern waste 
facilities. When composting, shred solid waste with most of the nonorganic 
material removed. Arrange the organic material into a row and turned it frequently 
to promote decomposition. In addition to disposing of unwanted solid waste, 
compost can be useful for agricultural purposes and as a cover material on slopes 
or at sanitary landfills because of its resistance to erosion. If a compost operation 
is near the airfield, monitor the operation to ensure it does not adversely affect air 
operations. Installations anticipating establishing a composting operation should 
comply with requirements in the applicable Environmental Annex of the OPLAN 
and/or OPORD, the Combatant Command Solid Waste Management Plan, and 
other applicable theater requirements. 
 
9.3.4. Landfills. Disposing of solid waste in a landfill is a common practice at 
expeditionary contingency bases. However, before establishing a new landfill or 
expanding an existing landfill, units should have the approval of the Combatant 
Commander. Landfills at expeditionary bare bases generally fall into two 
categories—municipal solid waste landfills or sanitary landfills. Note: See UFC 
3-240-11 for additional guidance for landfills in support military operations. 
 
9.3.4.1. A municipal solid waste landfill is a discrete area of land or an excavation, 
on or off an installation, that receives solid waste like durable goods (e.g., 
appliances, tires, batteries), non-durable goods (e.g., newspapers, books, 
magazines), containers and packaging, food wastes, yard trimmings, and 
miscellaneous organic wastes from residential, commercial, and industrial non-
process sources. During landfill operations, work crews should use standard 
sanitary landfill techniques of spreading and compacting solid wastes and placing 
daily cover over disposed solid waste at the end of each operating day. 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
103 
 
9.3.4.2. Sanitary landfilling is an engineered solid waste disposal process that 
minimizes environmental hazards and nuisances of land disposal. Solid waste 
goes to a carefully selected and prepared site, deposited into a trench or controlled 
area, compacted, and covered with soil or other material daily. The sanitary 
landfill is capable of accepting a wide variety of solid waste types. Nearly all 
rubbish, garbage, trash, ashes, solid organic waste, and miscellaneous solids may 
be disposed of safely. This method is usable in combination with other waste 
reduction methods for example, incineration, baling, compacting, or shredding. 
 
9.3.5. Incinerator Facilities. In the context of this chapter, an incinerator is any 
furnace used in the process of burning solid or liquid waste to reduce the volume 
of the waste by removing the combustible matter (Figure 9.1). Incinerators should 
meet published air emissions/air quality requirements. Generally, incinerator 
operations at expeditionary bases are waste reduction methods and not disposal 
methods. However, incineration for energy recovery may be an option at more 
technically sophisticated facilities. Regardless, ash by-product from the 
incineration process should be disposed of through normal waste disposal 
methods. So, the incineration facility should be located as close to the waste 
collection point as possible to simplify the collection process. Although many 
factors affect the location of an incinerator plant, below are two basic factors: 
 
Figure 9.1. Incinerator Facility at Forward Operating Base. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
104 
 
9.3.5.1. Traffic. Consider the frequency and size of vehicles utilizing the inciner-
ator facility. Access roads should be all-season permanent roads; however, travel 
on and across primary roads shall be minimized. 
 
9.3.5.2. Location. Select locations that help mitigate noise and odors from the in-
cinerator. Be sure to evaluate prevailing wind direction to avoid transmitting 
odors to residential sites. 
 
9.3.6. Burn Pits. According to DODI 4715.19, Use of Open-air Burn Pits in Con-
tingency Operations, open-air burn pits may be used as a short-term solution dur-
ing contingency operations where no alternative disposal method is feasible. 
Combatant Commanders make determinations for circumstances in which no al-
ternative disposal method is feasible. See additional guidance for planning, con-
structing and operation of burn pits in AFH 10-222V4. 
 
9.4. Hazardous Waste. Disposal of hazardous waste at expeditionary contin-
gency bases must comply with Department of Defense policy and guidance, the 
Environmental Annex of Operations Plans or Orders, and applicable international 
agreements. The Defense Logistics Agency should approve any incinerators used 
for disposing hazardous waste. Review requirements in DODI 4715.22 and the 
Environmental Annex of the Operations Plan and/or Order and consult with base 
environmental personnel for additional guidance and assistance on the handling 
and disposing of hazardous waste.

BASE DEFENSE 
 
10.1. General Information. Protection of personnel and assets is always an 
important task at expeditionary bases. It can be especially challenging when 
forces are beddown at austere, forward operating bases close to the battle area or 
areas with a high probability of terrorist attacks. Although absolute protection 
against all attacks is not possible, implement protective plans and procedures 
based on the latest threat information. During bare base development, engineer 
and security forces coordinate base defense requirements, establish protection 
zones, reinforce fighting positions, clear or establish obstacles, and harden base 
perimeters; all to protect vital resources (Figure 10.1). Depending on potential 
threats, engineer work crews can also be heavily engaged in bunker construction 
and facility hardening activities. Even at low threat locations, workers may need 
to build force protection facilities and structures because low threat can easily turn 
into high threat overnight. 
 
Figure 10.1. Engineers and Security Forces Harden Base Perimeter. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
106 
 
10.2. Planning and Considerations. Site work is often the most visible part of 
base defense and force protection measures; however, engineer involvement in 
the planning process, including site surveys and site layout, is equally important. 
During the site survey, learn as much as possible about the region and specific 
location to assist in selecting a site suitable to beddown the expected population, 
weapon systems, support equipment, and other assets. Additionally, be sure to 
address and integrate force protection into the site layout. If site layout is 
ineffective, it could be extremely difficult and costly to rearrange assets to provide 
increased protection once beddown is complete. For additional guidance on force 
protection measures and protective construction requirements, review UFC 4-
010-01, GTA 90-01-011 (JFOB7 Handbook), and AFTTP 3-32.34V3, and consult 
with the theater engineer staff. 
 
10.2.1. As expeditionary airbases experience planned and unplanned growth, they 
typically end up needing additional land and resources. Consequently, every 
change that increases the base’s footprint usually requires modification to local 
force protection measures. Always consider force protection requirements when 
planning future expansion and growth. 
 
10.2.2. Many expeditionary and temporary structures used during contingencies 
are composed of metal frames and fabric or wood frames and rigid walls, they are 
generally impractical to harden or retrofit. For this reason, standoff distance is the 
primary approach to force protection in the expeditionary environment, which 
often drives the need for larger sites. Space should be sufficient to allow for 
dispersal of certain functions and equipment and to provide the commander the 
flexibility to increase the beddown population and standoff distances if needed in 
response to higher threat levels. 
 
10.2.3. Although BEAR shelters provide beddown forces with vital temporary 
protection from the elements at locations with limited infrastructure and support 
facilities, these same shelters create additional force protection challenges for the 
reasons addressed above. The inherent advantages of lighter, leaner, and more 
mobile shelters means designers had to make some tradeoffs in survivability. 
Most BEAR facilities cannot withstand even small arms fire, let alone fused 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
107 
 
munitions detonation. This makes it imperative that planners seriously consider 
personnel and asset protection at bare base locations, especially in high threat 
areas. In fact, in serious high threat areas, one of the first tasks might be digging 
foxholes and protective trenches for personnel protection. 
 
10.2.4. BEAR packages also include assets for aircraft protection, such as bin 
revetment kits addressed in Chapter 4. However, because of their weight, do not 
expect to receive these kits until well into the deployment timeline. In fact, they 
may even arrive by ship rather than air. Nevertheless, have all parking plans, 
revetment locations and configurations and fill material sources identified early. 
Start installing the kits as soon as they arrive. 
 
10.3. Physical Security Measures. A key element of force protection is physical 
security. The two broad areas of physical security that civil engineers might 
dedicate the majority of time and resources in expeditionary environments include 
perimeter security and internal security. 
 
10.3.1. Perimeter Security. An important force protection tasks civil engineers 
undertake during the initial stages of deployment and beddown is establishing 
perimeter security. Working with security forces, civil engineers help establish a 
continuous physical barrier that clearly defines the physical limits of the site to 
prevent unauthorized access. Perimeter security may include the following: 
 
• 
Perimeter berms and ditches 
• 
Perimeter fencing 
• 
Obstacles 
• 
Terrain modification and vegetation-clear zones 
• 
Obscuration screens 
• 
Entry control points and search pits 
• 
Security lighting 
• 
Guard towers/observation posts 
• 
Defensive fighting positions 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
108 
 
10.3.2. Internal Security. The focus on internal security, from a civil engineer 
perspective, generally involves establishing protective measures inside the base, 
and may include the following: 
 
• 
Side-wall protection and facility hardening 
• 
Dispersal 
• 
Compartmentalization 
• 
Revetments 
• 
Personnel bunkers 
• 
Power and water protection 
 
10.3.3. Protective Bunkers. When base development using BEAR assets nears 
completion, focus attention on providing protective bunkers for the base populace. 
These protective structures provide personnel immediate, short-term protection 
from the effects of weapon attacks. They may be constructed using prefabricated 
concrete modular forms, improvised materials, or built by local contractors. 
 
10.3.3.1. Field-expedient bunkers may be the only alternative when there are not 
enough permanently hardened facilities in the right locations—be sure to site 
these structures in areas readily accessible to base personnel.  
 
10.3.3.2. The best bunker usually provides the most protection but requires the 
least amount of effort to construct. Bunkers should have as much overhead cover 
as possible. Belowground bunkers require more construction effort but generally 
provide the highest level of protection from conventional and chemical weapons. 
Aboveground bunkers provide the best observation and are easier to enter and exit 
than belowground bunkers. They provide less protection from conventional 
weapons but may provide protection against liquid droplets of chemical agents. 
Aboveground bunkers are better when groundwater levels are close to the surface 
or when the ground is so hard that digging a belowground bunker is impractical. 
Figure 10.2 is an example of a contemporary expedient bunker. 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
109 
 
Figure 10.2. Example of Contemporary Expedient Bunker. 
 
 
 
10.3.3.3. If necessary, construct other types of improvised bunkers using general 
construction materials, sandbags, containers, and other available materials. 
During base development, look for and store such items as 55-gallon drums, 
pieces of revetment material, structural steel shapes, timber and wood packing 
materials, ship dunnage, steel or precast concrete culvert sections, container 
express (CONEX) boxes, etc. Unserviceable aluminum matting may be readily 
available, but exercise caution using these items because they do not support 
heavy loads over a large clear span. Do not use BEAR shipping and storage 
containers for bunker or shelter components; the base will need them intact later 
on for reconstitution of assets.  
 
10.3.4. Defensive Fighting Positions. These fighting positions range from 
expediently constructed bunkers to elevated hardened observation towers. Site 
defensive fighting positions in locations that support base defense operations. 
Position these structures mostly around the base perimeter; and other areas as 
needed. When necessary, civil engineer personnel use these protective structures 
for work party security and in conjunction with dispersed operations.  Note: see 
UFC 3-260-01, for information on siting defensive fighting positions within the 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
110 
 
primary surface and land use control area of the clear zone. When temporary 
defensive fighting positions are not in use or are no longer required, they must be 
removed from the airfield and grades restored. 
 
10.3.5. Obstacles and Barriers. During bare base development, erect or place 
obstacles and barriers where needed to support force protection requirements. 
While there are many different types and functions, expedient anti-personnel and 
anti-vehicle structures will often be necessary at various locations around the base 
perimeter and at key on-base facilities. 
 
10.3.6. Berms and Revetments. It may be necessary to build berms and revetments 
around critical facilities and utility nodes. Although it will be nearly impossible 
to construct protective features for all candidate locations quickly due to material, 
time or worker shortfalls, prioritize your requirements carefully. Look primarily 
at mission sensitivity. Consider protecting water and power plants early—without 
these utility services bare base operations will rapidly shut down. Also, consider 
key secondary distribution centers, maintenance shops, and command posts. See 
Chapter 4 for more information on siting berms and revetments. 
 
10.3.7. Clearing Obstacles. In addition to erecting obstacles, removing unwanted 
obstacles is also an important force protection task for engineers. Work crews may 
need to clear obstacles on or around the airfield or clear terrain along the base 
perimeter. Especially, in areas where security forces need clear areas or 
vegetation-free zones for observation or to eliminate possible areas of enemy 
concealment near the installation’s boundary. 
 
10.4. CBRN Defense. The potential for accidental or deliberate release of CBRN 
agents within the operational area is a major concern. Additionally, the threat of 
an adversary or enemy combatant using CBRN materials against a contingency 
base, either during base development or after construction, is always present. 
 
10.4.1. Engineers are responsible for a number of force protection tasks associated 
with CBRN defense; some include: 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023 
111 
 
• 
Coordinate CBRN defense operations 
• 
Layout CBRN defense areas 
• 
Establish CBRN monitoring points 
• 
Establish alerting system and contamination control areas 
• 
Construct and improve personnel shelters 
• 
Determine decontamination procedures 
• 
Site Decontamination Stations 
 
10.4.2. While Emergency Management specialists primarily support all of the 
CBRN defense tasks listed above, other engineer specialists will also be involved. 
For example: 
 
• 
Utilities personnel may need to run water lines to decontamination 
stations 
• 
Engineering assistants may need to survey potential sites for 
decontamination stations, contamination control areas, and shelters 
• 
Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration personnel could 
be involved with installing and maintaining collective protection systems 
• 
Heavy equipment operators might have to level terrain or dig drainage 
ditches for decontamination operations 
• 
Nearly every Prime BEEF specialty will somehow be involved in CBRN 
defense and force protection operations

better footing and prevent crumbling/cave in of sides. 
• Two trenches. Each trench is 1 foot wide x 2.5 feet deep x 4 feet long and 
can accommodate 2 people at a time. 
• Excreta should be covered with soil after each use since the trenches are open 
to filth flies, thereby reducing the serviceable volume. 
• Design capacity: 2 trenches (capacity for 4) per 100 males, 3 trenches 
(capacity for 6) per 100 females. 
• An interim measure, only expected to last 1-3 days while final facilities are 
being constructed are installed. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Can be dug quickly 
 
• Don’t last long (1-3 days) 
• Trenches open to filth flies—should cover excreta 
after each use 
• Covering excreta partially fills trench. 
• Difficult to use—no seats or support. 
• Sides may collapse in some sandy desert soils.

without caving in. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use: Good. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions: Side wall strength may be insufficient 
in some sandy desert soils. In other locations, clayey soils can hinder or 
prevent percolation. If permitted, pit life can be extended by burning the 
contents of the deep-pit latrine weekly.

A6.4. Bored-Hole Latrines. 
Bored-Hole Latrines 
• Made by boring a cylindrical hole 6 to 20 feet in the ground. 
• Half a drum (e.g., 55-gallon) with a hole cut in it and a seat on top of the 
half-drum is placed over the hole. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Can be constructed quickly 
with a drill rig and cutting 
torch. 
• The standard configurations 
would be expected to last 
roughly 16 to 63 days. 
• Deserts too rocky or too sandy may preclude 
its use. 
• Desert soil should be soft enough to dig and 
firm enough to hold the walls and edges 
without caving in. 
• Bored-hole latrines may need side wall 
support. (e.g., from cylindrical drums) in 
sandy desert soils, or should be more 
shallow. 
• Requires engineering support to bore hole 
and cut drums. 
Technical Suitability for Desert Use:  Ranges from very good to poor, depend-
ing on side wall strength. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions:  Side wall strength may be insufficient 
in some sandy desert soils.

A6.5. Mound Latrines. 
Mound Latrines 
• A mound above grade with a trench in it and a 4-seat box over the pit. 
• Either a mound is constructed and a trench is dug in the mound, or soil is 
piled up in stages around supporting walls that will become the trench. 
• Trench is located 1 foot above groundwater or rock; depth is variable. 
PROS 
CONS 
• May be suitable in rocky desert soil or 
mountainous deserts where the ground is 
too rocky to dig. 
• The standard configurations of a 4-seat 
mound latrine with a 6-foot deep pit would 
be expected to last roughly 35 days. 
• Requires engineering support 
to construct mound and 
trench. 
• Liquid wastes may escape 
through the side of the mound 
if the soil is too permeable. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use:  Very good in absorbing soils. Poor 
where liquid waste could break through the mound. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions:  Leakage from side of the mound is 
possible with sandy desert soils.

Burn-Out Latrines 
• 55-gallon metal drum is cut in half and placed under a seat. Handles are 
welded onto the drum. 
• Plywood shelter to support toilet seat and provide privacy. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Can be constructed 
quickly with the right 
equipment. 
• Can last indefinitely, 
requiring only the 
remaining ash to be 
buried. 
• International agreements and the Environmental 
Annex of the OPLAN and/or OPROD may prohibit 
open burning or air emissions.  
• Requires engineering support to cut drums and 
weld handles. 
• Labor and fuel intensive. 
• Smoke from burning waste can announce presence. 
Detrimental if tactical security is a concern. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use: Very Good. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions: None.

A6.7. Chemical, Portable or Self-Contained Vault Toilets. 
Chemical, Portable and Self-Contained Toilets 
• Self-contained portable or non-portable outbuildings with a holding tank 
under the seat. 
• May contain chemical additives that aid in the decomposition of the waste 
and odor control. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Have been used successfully 
when serviced adequately and 
wastes disposed of properly. 
• Can be adapted for use as 
burn-out latrines if wastewater 
treatment facility or waste 
disposal support (e.g., sewage 
vacuum trucks) is unavailable. 
• Should be pumped out at weekly to break 
the filth fly reproductive cycle, or as 
frequently as daily depending upon usage. 
• Pumped out material should be disposed 
of properly. 
• A proper waste disposal area should be 
prepared within 1 week. 
• Length of use is limited by the disposal 
area. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use: Very Good.

Attachment 7 
PROS AND CONS OF EXPEDIENT WASTEWATER DISPOSAL 
FACILITIES 
Table A7.1. Evaporation Beds. 
Evaporation Beds 
• Intended for kitchen, wash, and bath wastewater. 
• Expedient evaporation beds are often small (8 feet x 10 feet x 6 inches) with 
rows or in 3 tiers where one pond flows into the next if space is limited. 
• 3 square feet/person/day for kitchen waste plus 2 square feet/person/day for 
wash and bath water 
• Beds are flooded to an average depth of 3 inches on successive days. Beds 
are rotated and water should evaporate and percolate within 4 days. 
Underlying soil is spaded and bed is reused. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Simple to build 
• Labor intensive. 
• Time consuming to maintain. 
• Small capacity. 
• Space consuming. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use: Good. Suitable for small units (generally 
90 or less people). 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions: Clayey soils may expand, become 
impermeable, and prevent sufficient percolation. Impermeable caliche may 
prevent sufficient percolation. 
Notes and Other Factors: 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023

Table A7.2. Soakage Pits and Trenches. 
Soakage Pits and Trenches 
• Designed for liquids only. 
• Pit 4 feet x 4 feet filled with gravel, rubble, or shredded metal, e.g., 
aluminum cans. 
• Constructed as stand-alone urine soakage pits with urine tubes or pipes. 
• Should be constructed in conjunction with standard in-ground latrines, 
chemical toilets or burn-out latrines for solid human waste. 
• Soakage pits or trenches for shower and kitchen are built separately from 
urine soakage pits. Four trenches radiating from a central1-foot deep pit are 6 
feet long, 2 feet wide and increase in depth from 1 to 1-1/2 feet.  Kitchen 
soakage pits or trenches also need grease traps to prevent percolation from 
being blocked. 
• No estimate of length of service for soakage pits and trenches is made in any 
field manuals, except the instruction to build a new one when the existing 
one stops working (standing water observed). 
PROS 
CONS 
• Reduces traffic in latrines intended 
for solid human waste. 
• Reduces liquid in burn-out latrines, 
which reduces the amount of fuel 
required for burning out semi-
solids. 
• Can last indefinitely if soil is 
permeable. 
• Should compete for gravel that can be 
in high demand for other uses. 
• Rubble or gravel may not be plentiful 
at the beginning of deployment when 
needed to build soakage pit. 
• May need to build new one on short 
notice, especially if soil is not 
permeable. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use: Good. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions: Clayey soils may expand, become im-
permeable, and prevent sufficient percolation. Impermeable caliche may pre-
vent sufficient percolation.

Table A7.3. Sewage Lagoons. 
Sewage Lagoons 
• Shallow lagoon or pond dug into ground. Excavated material is sometimes 
formed into earthen walls. Walls and bottom may require waterproof skin. 
• Wastewater is pumped from camp to lagoon. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Lagoon proper can be 
constructed easily with 
mechanized equipment. 
• One option for sewage disposal 
prescribed in “The Sand 
Book.” 
• Should be located at least 1/2 mile from 
population center because of odor and filth 
fly/mosquito breeding. 
• Requires sewer collection system piping 
and possibly automatic lift stations. 
• Earthen walls can leak. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use:  Satisfactory to Poor. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions:  Clayey soils may hold water. May act 
similar to an evaporation bed, except that the pest reproduction cycle is not 
broken by a drying period. 
Notes and Other Factors: 
 
 
 
AFTTP 3-32.34V1, 20 October 2023

Table A7.4. Leach Fields. 
Leach Fields 
• A gravity-fed subsurface drainage bed system, such as a tile or plastic pipe 
drain field consisting of narrow, shallow trenches through which effluent is 
discharged. 
• The effluent infiltrates the soil primarily through the sides of the trenches. 
• Provides physical, biological, and chemical treatment. 
• Settling system, such as septic tank or Imhoff tank, to remove sewage solids, 
at a minimum is implied as pretreatment. 
PROS 
CONS 
• Underground system eliminates 
surface discharge and 
subsequently human contact or 
filth fly and mosquito breeding. 
• Can be close to human habitation. 
• Treatment and disposal work well 
where soil porosity is moderate. 
• Low maintenance. 
• Can last many years. 
• Requires a significant amount of space. 
• Slope should be less than 25%. 
• Can clog permanently if solids enter 
the leach field. 
• Requires moderately porous soil so 
that sewage will neither backup or 
pond on the surface nor percolate too 
rapidly to contaminate the ground 
water. 
Technical Suitability For Desert Use: Excellent to Good. 
Desert-Specific Limitations/Conditions: None.
