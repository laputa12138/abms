Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This publication provides general operational and planning guidance on the Air 
Force Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT).  It can be used as a source document for developing 
standardized policies, operating procedures, training programs, and allowance standards.  
Operation plans and regional guidance provide mission-specific details that amplify and tailor the 
guidance contained in this publication. 
1.2.  Background.  The AFRAT traces its roots to the 1960s and the height of the Cold War.  The 
team’s primary mission was to respond to accidents involving nuclear weapons as Strategic Air 
Command maintained the nation’s defense posture through Operation CHROME DOME.  Since 
that time, the team’s focus has expanded to include the full spectrum of radiological and nuclear 
threats (rad/nuc) across the competition continuum.  The team has deployed to conflict zones, 
provided support to domestic civil authorities, and responded to nuclear reactor accidents.  
Operation TOMODACHI in 2011 was the most extensive and longest running real-world 
employment of the AFRAT since its inception.  Lessons learned from that event and numerous 
field exercises since then have informed changes and improvements to the team’s tactics, 
techniques, and procedures, force packaging concepts, and allowance standards. 
1.3.  Medical Threat Environment.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 
potential adversarial acts involving improvised nuclear devices, radiological dispersal devices, 
radiological exposure devices, or an attack on nuclear facilities or transportation systems pose a 
radiological threat to U.S. national security and U.S. forces.  Non-deliberate radiological threats 
include nuclear weapons accidents (broken arrows), nuclear reactor incidents (faded giants), and 
exposure to depleted uranium munitions and other radioactive materials. 
1.3.1.  Radiation exposure poses a spectrum of possible health effects, depending on the 
radiation dose received, that can range from acute radiation syndrome to increased cancer risk 
as well as psychological impacts.  These effects have potential to reduce mission effectiveness, 
impact immediate troop health, and contribute to long-term medical issues for deployed forces. 
1.3.2.  Force health protection measures include comprehensive radiation surveillance and 
dose prevention.  The AFRAT provides a specialized capability to measure, analyze, and 
evaluate the radiation levels that exist in the environment, effectively quantify and 
communicate these risks to field commanders, and provide guidance on personnel protective 
measures.  The team performs internal and external dose assessments for personnel operating 
in radiation contaminated areas to minimize exposure.

AFRAT SUPPORT CAPABILITIES AND FORCE PACKAGING 
2.1.  Mission.  The AFRAT provides rapid, global response to rad/nuc accidents and incidents.  
They provide expertise in planning, surveillance, analysis, and assessment of health, 
environmental, and operational risks.  They advise commanders and other decision makers on 
radiation health effects, operational impacts, protective actions, recovery activities, environmental 
health risks, and risk management during contingency planning, response, and post-contingency 
operations. 
2.2.  AFRAT Composition.  AFRAT capabilities are grouped into distinct unit type codes (UTCs) 
that provide scalable response options tailored to operational requirements.  The rapid response 
team can support initial operations up to 72 hours.  Individual support teams can be added to 
supplement the existing capabilities at an operating location.  Deployment of the full team is 
recommended for large-scale or extended duration incidents.  See Chapter 3, OPERATIONS, 
for more information on employment scenarios.  Table 2.1 provides the personnel details.

OPERATIONS 
3.1.  UTC Posturing.  AFRAT UTCs are postured against units in the Unit Type Code 
Availability database and Medical Resource Letter.  AFRAT equipment and facility infrastructure 
packages may be pre-positioned in theater based on requirements from geographic combatant 
commanders and the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). 
3.2.  Deployment Planning.  Planners consider a number of factors, including pre-positioned 
materiel, host nation support agreements, contingency contracts, and acquisition cross-service 
agreements, in planning deployments and tailoring unit-level personnel and equipment 
requirements.  Time-phased force deployment data is built by the air component and flowed 
through the major commands to the wing plans and operations centers for action. 
3.3.  Pre-Deployment Preparations.  Team members should work closely with the medical 
readiness office, emergency management, and theater medical personnel to prepare for 
deployment.  They should review operation plans, reporting instructions, threat and vulnerability 
assessments, intelligence reports, and other pertinent deployment data and follow the pre-
deployment requirements in AFI 10-403 and AFI 41-106, Air Force Medical Readiness Program.  
3.3.1.  All personnel considered for deployment with any AFRAT component should have 
accomplished 70 percent or more of their UTC’s mission essential task list items unless waived 
by the AFRAT chief. 
3.3.2.  Due to the sensitive and highly classified nature of some AFRAT missions, team chiefs 
should possess a Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance or 
interim clearance. 
3.3.3.  The AFRAT chief and non-commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) should ensure that 
all deploying personnel and equipment meet the tasking requirements defined by the supported 
command. 
3.4.  Preparation of Equipment and Cargo.  UTC team chiefs should assess the deployability of 
assigned equipment UTCs with medical logistics personnel and identify shortfalls.  Deploying 
AFRAT chiefs should ensure an adequate number of personnel are qualified in pallet build-up and 
cargo handling procedures (to include hazardous, protected, and classified cargo) to serve as cargo 
increment monitors during deployment and redeployment in accordance with AFI 10-403. 
3.4.1.  Hazardous cargo is subject to Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R Part 
III, Mobility, Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 24-604, Preparing Hazardous Materials for 
Military Air Shipments, and host nation requirements.  AFRAT equipment packages include 
radiological check sources that require special shipment preparation.  The local radiation safety 
officer should witness and verify the packaging of radiological sources.  AFRAT chiefs should 
ensure an adequate number of personnel are trained in shipping and receiving radioactive 
materials and adhere to Department of Transportation requirements specified in Title 49, Code 
of Federal Regulations 172, Part 172, Hazardous Materials Table, Special Provisions, 
Hazardous Materials Communications, Emergency Response Information, Training 
Requirements, and Security Plans, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements 
specified in Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations 71.5, Transportation of Licensed Material, 
AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
13 
and Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations 20.1906, Procedures for Receiving and Opening 
Packages.  While at the deployed location, radiological sources should be closely managed. 
3.4.2.  Protected cargo includes controlled substances, items vulnerable to theft, and weapons 
and ammunition.  A controlled medical item custodian should witness and verify the packaging 
of medically controlled items.  At the deployed location, controlled items should be stored in 
locked rooms or containers and managed in accordance with AFMAN 41-209, Medical 
Logistics Support.  Units are responsible for assigning primary and alternate weapons and 
ammunition couriers to ensure security and accountability during transit in accordance with 
Department of the Air Force Instruction (DAFI) 31-101, Integrated Defense, and Department 
of the Air Force Manual (DAFMAN) 21-201, Munitions Management. 
3.4.3.  Classified material should be packaged, marked, safeguarded, and transported in 
accordance with DAFI 24-602 Volume 2, Cargo Movement.  Units are responsible for 
assigning appropriately cleared and trained couriers to accompany classified material. 
3.5.  Deployment.  The AFRAT typically deploys in a crisis planning, consequence management, 
and force health protection role following a radiological or nuclear incident.  Typical deployment 
scenarios include nuclear weapons accidents (broken arrows), nuclear reactor accidents (faded 
giants), release of a radiological dispersal or improvised nuclear device, and humanitarian 
assistance following a nuclear incident.  The team may also deploy to high threat areas based on 
available intelligence data and theater requirements to provide crisis planning support and limited 
radiation surveillance.  The AFRAT may deploy in whole or in part, depending on the type of 
event, magnitude, and capabilities of other field response resources.  The full complement of 
AFRAT UTCs typically deploys in response to large-scale or extended duration radiological or 
nuclear events.  Individual components may deploy to provide tailored support to planning, pre-
positioning, or initial recovery operations.  The Rad/Nuc Incident Response Team deploys as soon 
as possible upon notification to establish initial capability followed by the other AFRAT support 
teams if necessary. 
3.6.  Initial Employment.  The Rad/Nuc Incident Response Team provides ground commanders 
a rapid-response force trained to conduct specialized consequence management.  The team may 
provide direct support to the joint task force commander, air component, or other theater forces as 
directed in the operation order.  During the initial phase of employment, priorities are to establish 
command and control, provide input into site selection, conduct preliminary health risk 
assessments, consequence management, surveillance, data analysis reviews, downrange mission 
planning, and distribute electronic personal dosimeters.  The team works to determine the type and 
extent of the radiological hazard and implement necessary protective actions to minimize radiation 
doses.  Should the ground situation exceed the team’s capabilities, additional rad/nuc support 
teams may be deployed. 
3.7.  Employment of AFRAT Support UTCs.  The AFRAT support UTCs reinforce the 
Rad/Nuc Incident Response Team and typically only deploy for large-scale or extended duration 
operations or when the Incident Response Team’s on-scene assessment determines additional 
support is needed.  They may deploy with the Incident Response Team or as follow-on support. 
3.7.1.  The Rad/Nuc Surveillance personnel and equipment UTCs (FFRN2 and FFRND) 
deploy to areas with extensive radiological contamination and when additional surveillance 
and radiation assessment resources are needed.  The team can be operational within 24 hours 
of initial arrival or redeployment. 
14 
AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
3.7.2.  The Rad/Nuc Laboratory personnel and equipment UTCs (FFRN4 and FFRNB) deploy 
to areas with extensive radiological contamination or when onsite radioanalytical capabilities 
are needed.  The team can be operational within 48 hours of initial arrival or redeployment. 
3.7.3.  The Rad/Nuc Dosimetry personnel and equipment UTCs (FFRN6 and FFRNC) deploy 
when a major incident occurs or when radiation dose monitoring for more than 200 field 
personnel is required.  The team can be operational within 24 hours of initial arrival or 
redeployment. 
3.7.4.  The Tactical C2 Support Team (FFRN8) deploys for large-scale and extended duration 
operations when dedicated administration, command center, material management, equipment 
calibration and repair, and communications technical support is needed.  The team should 
deploy with or closely after the Rad/Nuc Incident Response Team to help establish the team’s 
operations center, medical communications, site laydown, and supply chain support.  The team 
does not have a separate equipment package. 
3.7.5.  The Rad/Nuc Response Liaison Team (FFRN9) deploys for large-scale and extended 
duration operations where on-site liaison officer support is needed.  The team provides on-site 
technical assistance in crisis planning, response, health risk assessment, and AFRAT command 
support.  The four-person team can be split into smaller increments.  The team’s accompanying 
supplies are hand portable and include radiological risk assessment tools. 
3.8.  Domestic and International Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) 
Response.  Upon direction by higher headquarters, the AFRAT may deploy to assist in domestic 
and international CBRN response efforts.  The combatant command for the area of responsibility 
determines which AFRAT personnel and equipment UTCs support the mission based on mission 
scope, threat assessment, and availability of forces.  The AFRAT can also augment the 
consequence management efforts of civilian authorities overwhelmed by a significant or 
catastrophic radiological or nuclear incident to the extent allowed by law to save lives, reduce 
suffering, and protect the environment.  See Joint Publication (JP) 3-41, Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, and Nuclear Response, for more information on U.S. military support for domestic 
and international CBRN Response. 
3.9.  Site Laydown Considerations.  Beddown locations are at the discretion of the field 
commander.  Ideally, AFRAT components should be positioned in a secure, forward operating 
location within 5 kilometers of the supported contingency upwind of the impacted area.  The 
equipment packages for the surveillance, laboratory, and dosimetry support teams include 
workspace shelters to house operations.  Site laydown considerations include security, accessibility 
to the impacted area, proximity to environmental hazards (flight-line noise, sewage plant, power 
and communication lines), orientation to current and projected wind and weather patterns, and 
terrain.  The AFRAT relies on current meteorological and imagery data for fallout and plume 
projections, risk assessments, radiological monitoring, and determination of appropriate protective 
actions.  See Attachment 3, FULL AFRAT LAYOUT, for a recommended site layout for the 
full team.  See Attachment 4, AFRAT SURVEILLANCE TEAM (FFRN2) SHELTER, for a 
sample shelter layout. 
3.10.  Operational Reports and Records.  AFRAT chiefs and NCOICs submit required 
operational reports in accordance with AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP), and 
specific combatant commander, joint force commander, and commander, Air Force forces 
requirements.  Data generated by the AFRAT (such as surveillance findings, radioanalytical data, 
AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
15 
and external ionizing dose assessment data) should be reported through the chain of command and 
in accordance with theater policy.  After-action reports and lessons learned are submitted in 
accordance with AFI 10-204, Air Force Service Exercise Program and Support to Joint and 
National Exercise Program, and AFI 10-1302, Air Force Lessons Learned Program.  Records 
associated with AFRAT operations are maintained and disposed of in accordance with AFI 33-
322, Records Management and Information Governance Program. 
3.11.  Redeployment.  The AFRAT chief and NCOIC should actively participate in redeployment 
planning to ensure a time-phased reduction in medical services consistent with the deactivation of 
the deployed location, change in mission, or change in threat scenario.  If applicable, AFRAT 
leadership should establish contact with their replacement teams to ensure continuity.  Team chiefs 
should ensure that custody of equipment is signed over to the transportation officer.  Equipment 
and supplies should be decontaminated in accordance with theater policy and applicable U.S. 
Department of Agriculture guidelines.  Items not suitable for redeployment (such as the laboratory 
waste stream) should be appropriately redirected within the theater or disposed of.

AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
Chapter 4 
COMMAND AND CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS 
4.1.  Command and Control in Expeditionary Settings.  Command and control for deployed 
AFRAT units is through line of the Air Force commanders.  Air Force elements deployed into a 
theater are typically aligned under the command of the COMAFFOR.  The AFRAT operates under 
the command structure established by the air expeditionary task force or joint task force to which 
they are assigned.  Command and control relationships are usually defined in the warning, 
execution, operations, or task order.  The AFRAT chief and NCOIC should have a clear 
understanding of the chain of command defined in the order before deployment and establish 
contact with leadership upon arrival. 
4.1.1.  The AFRAT normally operates under the local direction of the deployed expeditionary 
unit commander.  However, due to the nature of the rad/nuc mission set, another Service may 
have tactical control and in some instances operational control. 
4.1.2.  AFRAT members may be organized under separate chains of command with different 
missions.  For example, part of the team may be stationed with Joint Intelligence (J2) assets 
while the rest of the AFRAT is organized within Task Force Operations (TFOPS). 
4.2.  AFRAT Command Structure.  The AFRAT chief is typically the senior ranking officer on 
the Rad/Nuc Incident Response Team.  The AFRAT chief establishes the AFRAT organizational 
structure and identifies the team chiefs for each deployed AFRAT support UTC as necessary. 
4.3.  Air Combat Command Surgeon (ACC/SG) Responsibility.  ACC/SG is the Manpower 
and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Responsible Agency (MRA) for medical ground-
based UTCs.  ACC/SG has overall responsibility for AFRAT tactical doctrine, serves as the 
medical consultant for AFRAT operations, and provides technical guidance and planning.

Chapter 5 
COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
5.1.  Communications Requirements.  The AFRAT deploys with Department of Defense 
(DOD)-approved radios and computer systems.  The team is not equipped with the 
communications infrastructure needed for independent operation and relies on host base 
communication units.  The team requires access to the Defense Switched Network (DSN), secure 
voice communication, Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), and 
SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) for data collection, reporting, and 
reachback purposes.  See Attachment 2, EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT SUPPORT 
REQUIREMENTS, for more information on communication requirements. 
5.2.  Radio Equipment.  AFRAT equipment includes Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) 
compliant wideband and multiband land mobile radios.  These radios are interoperable with 
existing DOD radio systems and joint networking waveforms.  They support secure voice, data, 
and video communication over mobile, ad-hoc internet protocol based networks to include local 
command and control networks.  Radios are allocated according to the allowance standard and 
operational specific requirements.  These assets primarily support communications during 
deployment and redeployment phases and in austere environments where access to an established 
communications infrastructure may not be available. 
5.3.  Computer Systems.  Computers issued to the AFRAT include the DOD Standard Desktop 
Configuration, the Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP) suite for theater health service 
support, and applications to support radiological risk assessment and dose assessment.  Table 5.1 
lists the specialty-specific applications used by AFRAT.

Chapter 6 
INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY 
6.1.  Integration and Interoperability with Other Systems.  Deployed medical personnel in a 
theater or area of operation may support elements of an air expeditionary force, components of the 
en route continuum of care system, joint medical counterparts, Special Operations Forces medical 
components, and other federal and civilian agencies.  In some instances, theater planners may 
request medical support for bed-down locations not associated with a typical air expeditionary 
force or ECS/BOS infrastructure. 
6.2.  Expeditionary 
Combat 
Support/Base 
Operating 
Support 
(ECS/BOS) 
Requirements.  The AFRAT deploys with limited organic capability and requires ECS/BOS.  
ECS/BOS requirements include (but are not limited to) billeting, messing and other consumable 
materials, power, water, ice, latrines, showers, laundry, waste management, exterior lighting, 
transportation, fuels, vehicle maintenance, equipment maintenance, general supplies, contracting, 
information and communications systems support, and security.  ECS/BOS services are provided 
through the host base’s capabilities, deployable bare base systems, and contracted civilian support.  
Chemical, radiological, and mixed waste disposal services are normally obtained on a contract 
basis or as part of other base waste disposal services.  See Attachment 2, EXPEDITIONARY 
COMBAT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS, for quantified estimates on required support. 
6.3.  Field Response Integration.  AFRAT components may work with other Air Force field 
response teams (such as the PAM teams and emergency management) for rad/nuc mission support.  
At the direction of higher headquarters, the AFRAT might integrate with other DOD radiological 
assets, such as the Armed Forces Radiobiology Institute’s Medical Radiobiology Advisory Team 
(MRAT), U.S. Army Radiological Advisory Medical Team (RAMT), U.S. Army Nuclear 
Disablement Team (NDT), U.S. Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force 
(CBIRF), U.S. Army and Navy radiological control teams, and the Defense Threat Reduction 
Agency Consequence Management Advisory Team (CMAT).  When tasked in support of a 
Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) or large-scale foreign consequence management 
operation, the AFRAT might integrate with Department of Energy emergency response teams and 
other government agencies. 
6.4.  Technical Reachback.  All AFRAT UTCs rely on USAFSAM for technical reachback 
support.  USAFSAM provides radiation consulting, health physics expertise, electronic dosimeter 
reading and calibration, radiation detector calibration and support, and specialized equipment not 
found in the AFRAT deployable equipment packages.  The AFRAT can send samples that require 
more rigorous analysis to USAFSAM’s radioanalytical lab.  The lab, which is accredited by the 
National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), can perform nuclide-specific 
analysis and other procedures that require more complex chemistry preparation, specialized 
equipment, and lower limits of detection.  The lab’s capabilities include alpha spectroscopy, urine 
and fecal analysis, in-vivo whole body counting, HPGe gamma spectropscopy, inductively-
coupled–mass spectrometry, liquid scintillation, mobile monitoring, and electronic dosimetry.  
USAFSAM maintains comprehensive radiation exposure records for Air Force occupational 
radiation personnel.  AFRAT personnel may consult with USAFSAM for access to this data in 
accordance with theater policy.  See Attachment 5, USAFSAM RADIOANALYTICAL 
AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
19 
REACHBACK SUPPORT CAPABILITIES, for more information on USAFSAM’s 
radioanalytical support capabilities. 
6.5.  Sample Shipments.  The AFRAT should coordinate with the transportation management 
office, logistics, field laboratory, and emergency management on local plans for shipping samples 
of radiological, chemical, or biological matter for further testing, as well as chain of custody 
procedures.  The plan should identify the office of primary responsibility for packaging, shipping, 
escorting, and receiving the samples. 
20 
AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
Chapter 7 
SECURITY AND FORCE PROTECTION 
7.1.  Security Roles and Responsibilities.  Medical personnel and equipment are non-combatant 
assets and, along with medical equipment, have protected status under the Geneva Conventions 
and the Law of Armed Conflict.  Medical personnel and war reserve materiel assemblages are 
protected IAW DAFI 31-101.  Arming requirements for deploying AFRAT personnel are mission 
and operating location specific and are provided in reporting instructions and theater guidance.  
Current threat assessments provided by the combatant commander and local threat conditions 
established by the joint task force, air expeditionary wing, or air expeditionary group commander 
dictate all local security measures.  AFRAT personnel are responsible for following personal 
protection measures outlined in DAFI 31-101, area of responsibility security briefings, established 
force protection requirements, and local guidance. 
7.2.  Physical Security.  Security forces guard medical facilities only if deemed necessary as part 
of the Integrated Defense Plan.  If the threat changes, security forces may appoint an augmented 
detail to provide force protection and entry control (for example, a mass casualty event).  AFRAT 
personnel should coordinate with the defense force commander for tactical security element 
support for surveillance missions outside the base perimeter or beddown location. 
7.3.  Operations Security.  AFRAT personnel are responsible for protecting mission-critical 
information (to include medical or casualty information) in accordance with theater policy and 
AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC).  Classified information should be transmitted by 
secure means and protected in accordance with Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 5200.01, 
Volume 3_DAFMAN 16-1404, Volume 3, Information Security Program:  Protection of 
Classified Information.  Situation reports, medical surveillance, site locations, and compiled 
patient data are examples of information that may be classified and require protection. 
7.4.  Security of Weapons and Ammunition.  Weapons and ammunition should be secured in 
accordance with DAFI 31-101 and local procedures.  Normally, base security forces provide 
weapons handling guidance and an armory.  In austere locations where access to an armory might 
not be available, AFRAT personnel are responsible for the safe storage of weapons and 
ammunition until the armory can assume responsibility.  AFRAT personnel should coordinate with 
base security forces or the supported unit on local weapons handling guidance.

TRAINING 
8.1.  Medical Readiness Training Requirements.  Personnel assigned to AFRAT UTCs must 
complete the Comprehensive Medical Readiness Program (CMRP) training requirements 
specified in AFI 41-106 and the CMRP Category III Training Guide.  Additional training that 
might be required to meet operational or theater specific requirements is identified in deployment 
reporting instructions, tasking line remarks, or (for domestic CBRN response missions) the 
Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). 
8.2.  UTC and Job-Specific Training Requirements.  AFRAT members attend formal training 
courses that are specific to their job function and UTC mission set as identified in Table 8.1  These 
courses are a one-time requirement and are tracked in the Medical Readiness Decision Support 
System (MRDSS).  Waivers or alternatives for these training requirements may be granted at the 
discretion of the AFRAT chief with written approval from the MEFPAK responsible agency.

Note:  FFRN1 members should attend any of the courses that most closely correlates with 
their job functions.  
8.4.  UTC Sustainment Training.  UTC sustainment training occurs between formal course 
attendance cycles to maintain the skills and knowledge the team needs to fulfill its mission 
essential tasks.  UTC sustainment training credit may be granted for participation in mission 
essential task-driven exercises, operational readiness exercises, local exercises, and joint exercises.  
Contact the ACC Exercise and Training Branch for information on approved sustainment training 
exercises. 
8.4.1.  Following completion of the initial AFRAT Basic Workshop formal training courses, 
AFRAT personnel should attend the AFRAT Basic functional exercise (Course B) or 
equivalent approved exercise annually for refresher training.  Twice a year participation in the 
AFRAT Basic functional exercise is recommended.  The AFRAT chief and ACC/SGX 
determine whether other exercises are equivalent and acceptable. 
8.4.2.  The biomedical equipment technician assigned to FFRN8 needs to maintain familiarity 
and proficiency on the calibration, repair, and routine maintenance of the AFRAT’s radiation 
measurement equipment.  USAFSAM provides in-service, hands-on training on the AFRAT’s 
specialized equipment.  This training is typically done in conjunction with the AFRAT Basic 
course and should be coordinated through the pilot unit. 
8.5.  Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs).  Personnel assigned to an AFRAT UTC should be 
proficient in their functional-specific and AFRAT full team core METLs.  METLs are available 
on the ACC/SG MEFPAK Playbook (https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/12173/SitePages/ACC-SG-
Ground-Medical-UTC-Management.aspx) or from the ACC Exercise and Training Branch. 
8.6.  Pre-Deployment Mission Training.  When possible, deploying AFRAT personnel should 
meet at USAFSAM two working days before departure for mission training.  This training includes 
familiarization on mission communication and command structure, security and intelligence 
briefings, public health briefings, and expected radiological hazards. 
8.7.  CBRN Defense Training.  AFRAT personnel subject to deployment should complete the 
CBRN defense training requirements prescribed in AFI 41-106 and DAFI 10-2501, Air Force 
Emergency Management Program.  They should also be familiar with the CBRN passive defense 
and consequence management procedures outlined in AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Environment, JP 3-11, Operations in 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environments, and Planning Guidance for 
Response to a Nuclear Detonation developed by the Homeland Security Council Interagency 
AFTTP3-42.34  14 OCTOBER 2022 
25 
Policy Coordination Subcommittee for Preparedness and Response to Radiological and Nuclear 
Threats. 
8.8.  CBRN Response Force Training.  AFRAT personnel allocated to the CBRN Response 
Enterprise participate in Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF) and C2 CBRN Response 
Element (C2CRE) training, exercises, and evaluations in accordance with the Joint Mission 
Essential Task List.  Joint training plans, schedules, and training records are maintained in the 
Joint Training Management Information System (JTIMS). 
8.9.  Vehicle Operation Training.  Operators of government motor vehicles and material 
handling equipment must have a government driver’s license and appropriate certification in 
accordance with AFI 24-301, Ground Transportation. 
8.10.  Weapons Training.  AFRAT personnel follow the weapons qualification training 
requirements outlined in AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program, and AFMAN 36-2655, USAF 
Small Arms and Light Weapons Qualification Programs, for Arming Group C.  Theater combatant 
commands may impose additional or more stringent requirements, which are generally specified 
in the operation’s execution order or reporting instructions.  See the AFMS Arming Requirements 
document (also known as the Weapons and Munitions Forecasting Table) for weapons 
authorizations for AFRAT UTCs.  This document is available on the ACC/SG MEFPAK Playbook 
(https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/12173/SitePages/Playbooks.aspx) or by request from the ACC 
Ground Medical UTC Management Branch. 
8.11.  Communications and Information Systems Training.  AFRAT personnel should be 
trained in the proper use of the communications and information systems included in their 
equipment packages.

LOGISTICS 
9.1.  Expeditionary Medical Logistics (EML) System.  The EML system provides global 
support and sustainment to air expeditionary force medical forces across the full spectrum of 
operations.  The EML system uses a pull process for resupply and a repair-and-return process for 
medical equipment maintenance to minimize inventory and airlift requirements.  Each combatant 
command has a supporting Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel (TLAMM).  The TLAMM 
serves as a major theater medical distribution node and becomes the deployed unit’s primary point 
of contact for materiel and equipment support in theater.  For early phase operations and 
emergency situations in which a TLAMM is not able to provide support, the Air Force Forces 
Surgeon (AFFOR/SG) staff in coordination with the Air Force Medical Logistics Operations 
Center (AFMLOC) usually designate a sustaining base to provide reachback support.  Upon 
notification of activation, the AFRAT chief or logistics lead should contact the AFMLOC for 
guidance on the appropriate theater supply chain and points of contact.  See Department of the Air 
Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (DAFTTP) 3-42.8, Expeditionary Medical Logistics 
(EML) System, for more information on medical logistics support capabilities, infrastructure, and 
supply chain management. 
9.2.  Supplies and Equipment.  Most expeditionary medical equipment based in the continental 
United States is managed and deployed through designated consolidated storage and deployment 
centers (CSDCs).  Equipment UTCs may also be pre-positioned in theater based on requirements 
from geographic combatant commanders and the COMAFFOR.  Initial deployments include 72 
hours of supplies packaged in hand-portable backpacks.  The full AFRAT deploys with 30 days 
of supplies (the initial 72-hour incident response package plus three sustainment packages).  UTC 
team chiefs should be aware of the contents of their equipment packages before deployment and 
should contact their medical logistics office for assistance with reviewing their allowance 
standards.  At the deployed location, UTC team chiefs coordinate subsequent resupply through 
their medical logistics function.  Table 9.1 lists the allowance standard for each AFRAT 
equipment package.

9.3.  Medical Equipment Maintenance and Repair.  USAFSAM provides routine calibration 
and maintenance of the AFRAT’s specialized radiation instrumentation and war reserve materiel.  
In a deployed setting, the USAFSAM Radiation Calibration Laboratory (USAFSAM/OEAR) 
provides reachback support for calibration and repair of equipment.  When deployed, the 
biomedical equipment repair technician assigned to the Tactical C2 Support Team (FFRN8) 
provides routine maintenance and repair of medical equipment at the deployed location.

9.4.  Equipment Upgrades and Modernization.  Changes to the AFRAT assemblage may result 
from technology advances and lessons learned feedback.  MRAs typically budget and plan for 
major equipment reviews every five years.
