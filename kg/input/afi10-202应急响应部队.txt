Chapter 1 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1.  General.  This chapter provides guidance to execute contingency response (CR) force 
operations and specific guidance for executing the “Open the Airbase” (OPEN) Force Element 
(FE) mission in the absence of combatant command (CCMD) or higher headquarters (HHQ) 
guidance. When executing CR deployed operations, reference the 2023 CR Force Concept of 
Operation (CONOP) and the Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-4.7, 
Contingency Response in conjunction with this instruction. 
1.2.  Administration. 
1.2.1.  For completeness, this instruction contains cross-functional information from various 
sources. This instruction has precedence in the case of any conflicts, revisions and matters of 
interpretation over other source directives for all CR matters. 
1.2.2.  Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. Key words explained: 
1.2.2.1.  “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 
1.2.2.2.  “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 
1.2.2.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 
1.3.  Background. 
1.3.1.  Contingency Response Forces are prepared to participate in the full spectrum of 
operations ranging from deployments to limited regional conflicts to major combat operations. 
These forces provide initial force protection (FP) to secure and protect CR operating areas 
(aircraft parking ramp, CR operations centers, and CR camp), rapidly assess and open airfields, 
and perform initial airfield operations. 
1.3.2.  Further enabling expeditionary operations, CR forces are a subset of capabilities 
explicitly designed to rapidly respond to contingencies and humanitarian assistance and 
disaster relief (HA/DR) operations. These forces also deploy on very short notice to support 
missions such as President of the United States (POTUS) support, security cooperation 
engagements and operations, Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAMs), Joint Airborne 
and Air Transportability training, building partnership exercises, and United States Air Force 
(USAF) aircraft deployment support. This unique set of capabilities provides the foundation 
for all USAF CR organizations to be standardized, resourced, trained, and operational. 
1.3.3.  Furthermore, CR forces execute the OPEN FE as referenced in DAFI 10-401, 
Operations Planning and Execution. 
1.4.  Objective.  This instruction addresses CR roles and capabilities, standardizes core 
capabilities and expectations, and provides top-level guidance on force presentation, training, 
tasking processes, and command relationships. 
1.4.1.  The 2023 CR CONOP defines the CR’s mission as the ability to open an airbase/airfield, 
regardless of the follow-on mission or aircraft type. This module represents all CR forces' 
baseline capability, skill, and equipment. 
6 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
1.4.2.  CR forces are the USAF’s rapid response to requests to open an airbase and conduct 
initial airfield operations. Therefore, they must be able to rapidly deploy, assess and open a 
location, and conduct initial operations immediately upon arrival in various climatic and threat 
environments, including denied, disconnected, intermittent, or limited (D-DIL) environments. 
(T-2) 
1.5.  Mission.  CR forces are a rapid response organic capability that provides initial 
airbase/airfield opening capability and operations, bridges the gap between seizure forces and the 
follow-on combat or combat support forces when required, extends the global mobility en-route 
system, jointly opens ports, and operates worldwide where little or no air operations support exists. 
CR forces' operating locations may vary from robust international airports to semi-prepared dirt 
landing zones (LZ), which may not be initially mission supportable due to damage resulting from 
conflict or environmental conditions. The CR force may be required to assess the airfield or LZ 
capabilities and make suitability recommendations to the controlling agency before deploying the 
CR forces’ main body. Although a single CR force is usually tasked to support one operating 
location, it may be required to support multiple locations (split operations) if the mission dictates, 
the scope of operation is limited, and the necessary personnel and equipment are available. CR 
forces are composed of personnel who are both expeditionary operators and cross-functionally 
skilled experts, trained and equipped to operate effectively in the joint and coalition environment. 
To meet this mission: 
1.5.1.  CR forces are organized, trained, and equipped to support scaled operations for a 
maximum of 60 days without augmentation. Contingency Response Team (CRT) can 
continuously work one aircraft at a time during a 12-hour day with a throughput of up to 100 
pallet position equivalents (PPEs). Contingency Response Element (CRE) can continuously 
work two aircraft at a time during a 24-hour day with a throughput of up to 400 PPEs. 
1.5.2.  Conduct worldwide airfield assessments, drop zone (DZ) and LZ surveys to determine 
the capabilities and limitations of specified airfields and LZs in support of air mobility 
operations. 
1.5.3.  CR forces can sustain operations under bare base conditions for five days without 
resupply. 
1.5.4.  CR forces are capable of closing airfield operations and/or transitioning operations to 
follow-on forces or host-nation representatives. In accordance with Joint Publication 4-04, 
Contingency Basing, the Base Commander or Base Operating Support-Integrator (BOS-I) is 
responsible for execution of a base transfer or closure. 
1.5.5.  CR forces can survive and minimally operate in chemical, biological, radiological, and 
nuclear (CBRN) environments only when deployed with organic CR or external emergency 
management (EM) forces capable of CBRN detection and decontaminating personnel and 
equipment. As a result, CR operations will be degraded and limited to the amount of CBRN 
equipment and support on hand. CR force's ability to operate at higher threat levels depends 
on their integration with combat forces. See the CR designed operational capacity (DOC) 
statement/Defense Readiness Report System (DRRS) and paragraph 1.6.8. 
1.5.6.  CR forces can terminate CR-initiated airfield operations and/or transition operations to 
follow-on forces or host nation representatives. 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024

1.6.  Core Capabilities.  CR forces’ unique and organic capabilities allow them to rapidly respond 
as a single entity or as lead for augmented forces. CR forces are organized, trained, manned, and 
equipped to provide the following core capabilities with assigned forces and must constantly 
remain ready to: 
1.6.1.  Provide capabilities that permit uninterrupted operations supporting initial 
airbase/airfield opening requirements, during deployment of joint or coalition forces involving 
air operations from austere locations to commercial airfields, under permissive and non-
permissive environments, which may include D-DIL environments. 
1.6.2.  Support short-notice requirements as the first on-scene USAF forces. 
1.6.3.  Rapidly respond in support of contingency operations, HA/DR response, or any 
required airbase/airfield opening operations. 
1.6.4.  Be light, lean, and lethal for deployment, employment, redeployment, and 
reconstitution. 
1.6.5.  Conduct comprehensive airfield assessments globally to determine the capacities and 
constraints of designated airfields and LZs in support of air mobility operations. The CR 
Assessment teams are required to perform rapid inter and intra theater movement. This 
includes the in-fil of forces and equipment using rotary-wing aircraft via sling-loadable 
configurations, as well as making efficient use of limited pallet positions on available cargo 
aircraft, sea-lift, and over-the-road driving to locations. The versatility of these teams ensures 
adaptability to diverse operational scenarios and facilitates effective evaluation of airfield and 
LZ capabilities worldwide. 
1.6.6.  Provide Airfield, DZ and LZ surveys to include completion of AF Form 1174, Airfield 
Survey, AF Form 3822, LZ survey, and AF Form 3823, DZ survey, when required. 
1.6.7.  Provide air operations capability assessment to include contractor and host-nation 
capabilities. 
1.6.8.  Provide initial command and control (C2) and reach-back capability. When required by 
operational environments, both secure and unsecure communication should include both line-
of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight for voice and data, to include secure tactical data link and 
other situational awareness tools. 
1.6.9.  Provide initial FP to include initial threat assessment, weapon system security, and 
protection of assets in CR operating areas. CR forces are not designed to participate directly in 
forcible entry or airfield seizure operations but must be able to closely interface with these 
operations in an accelerated timeline. (T-2)  CR forces will not provide primary airbase FP and 
will require additional security forces to effectively perform airbase perimeter security, 
detainee operations, and installation access control points (T-2) 
1.6.10.  Provide initial air mobility support operations, including quick-turn maintenance and 
aerial port operations. 
1.6.11.  Provide initial airfield operations to include airfield management, weather reporting 
capability, deployable navigation aids (NAVAIDs), Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO), and 
Drop Zone Controller (DZC) services. Provide Landing Zone Controller (LZC) services when 
1C1 or qualified 13M is present and required for Air Traffic Control services in Visual 
Meteorological Conditions. 
8 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
1.6.12.  Provide initial airbase/airfield CR support to include fuels, power production, 
contracting, finance, vehicle maintenance, materiel management, logistics readiness, 
aerospace ground equipment, personnel support, and other CR operating support. 
1.6.13.  Provide Role 1 medical support capability, which includes: immediate life-saving 
measures, disease and nonbattle injury prevention, combat and operational stress control 
preventive measures, triage and patient casualty collection. To the max extent, the FFGRL Unit 
Type Code (UTC) will reside inside of the Contingency Response Group (CRG) to ensure this 
capability is fully trained, integrated, and available at time of need. 
1.7.  Waivers and Deviations.  Deviation from policies and guidance specified in this instruction 
is only allowed if approved by appropriate waiver authority per Department of the Air Force 
Manual (DAFMAN) 90-161, Publishing Processes and Procedures. 
1.7.1.  Waiver authorities will forward copies of approved waivers to AMC/A34. (T-2) In 
addition, commanders will ensure that waiver requests are kept on file for two years. (T-3) 
1.7.2.  If the mission dictates immediate action to protect personnel or equipment, and the CR 
forces’ leadership cannot request an operational mission waiver during execution due to time 
constraints, the deployed CR commander or team chief may authorize the operation if the risk 
can be safely mitigated. The commander or team chief will report the deviation through their 
operational chain of command to the assigned MAJCOM/A3 or ANG/A3 within 48 hours. 
(T-2) This does not preclude additional home station notification for situational awareness. 
The commander or team chief must be prepared to collect background information and submit 
a follow-up written report upon request. (T-2)

FORCE STRUCTURE AND PRESENTATION 
3.1.  Selection, Manning, General Policies and Qualification of CR Force Personnel.  Regular 
Air Force (RegAF) personnel selected for a permanent change of station or permanent change of 
assignment to a CR force unit must have a minimum of three years of retainability to accommodate 
the additional training requirements. (T-2) For more details on force element force package (FEFP) 
capabilities, reference the CR CONOP and AFTTP 3-4.7, Contingency Response. 
3.1.1.  Unit manpower positions for Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside 
Continental United States (OCONUS) RegAF CR forces will be coded as a 3-year or 4-year 
Stabilized Tour Assignment Availability Code (as applicable in the Stabilized Tour Guide). 
(T-2) 
3.1.2.  If authorized by the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, all enlisted CR force 
personnel will be coded 090 Special Experience Identifier (SEI) after completing Basic 
Mission Qualification, nine months of experience from Date Arrived Station, and CR unit 
commander recommendation. (T-2) 
3.1.3.  Airmen being considered for a CR position will possess the AFSC, grade, skill level, 
and special experience identifiers assigned to that position, defined in the manpower force 
element (MFE) of a UTC. When CR leadership identifies personnel on assignment who do not 
meet minimum requirements, commanders will ensure that this information is elevated through 
the chain of command to AFPC. (T-2) 
3.1.4.  Official and regular passports are required for CR personnel and, when possible, 
international driver’s licenses. Commanders will ensure all personnel have the required 
passports, which will be purchased at government expense. (T-2) 
3.1.5.  All CR force personnel will have a secret clearance at a minimum. (T-3) 
3.1.6.  Unit Commanders, Directors of Operations, Assistant Directors of Operations, CR 
Element Commander, Operations Officers, CR Team Chief, and unit commander designated 
CR planners should possess a Top-Secret clearance and be matched to a Search and Rescue 
(SAR) 5 billet. 
3.1.7.  Members will fill UTC deployments based upon AFSC, training, qualification, and/or 
certification, regardless of home station duty title or position. (T-2) 
3.2.  Force Element Force Package (FEFP).  To meet the requirements of the OPEN FE, CR 
forces are designed into two FEFPs: Contingency Response Element (CRE) or Contingency 
Response Team (CRT). These packages are composed of multiple AFSCs and equipment. CR has 
additional specialized teams to augment or increase the CRE or CRT capabilities. The composition 
of CR forces varies depending on mission requirements. 
 
 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
15 
3.2.1.  CRE FEFP.  A CRE comprises approximately 100 personnel spanning multiple 
AFSCs, usually led by a field-grade officer. A CRE provides airfield surveys and assessments, 
operational assessments, C2, limited FP, initial airfield operations, weather services, organic 
base operating support (BOS), quick-turn maintenance, air mobility support, and other 
capabilities listed in the CR CONOP. The CRE may also comprise various units' contingency 
support elements for additional capabilities. A CRE provides aerial port capable of working 
two aircraft at a time during a 24-hour day (2/24) with a throughput of up to 400 PPEs. 
3.2.2.  CRT FEFP.  A CRT is a small multi-capable team of 25 personnel. CRTs shall be led 
by a senior non-commissioned officer. (T-2) A CRT provides airfield surveys, operational 
assessments, C2, limited FP, initial airfield operations, weather services, organic BOS, 
maintenance liaison, air mobility support, and other capabilities listed in the CR CONOP. A 
CRT provides 24-hour reach-back C2 coverage and aerial port capable of working one aircraft 
at a time during a 12-hour day (1/12) with a throughput of up to 100 PPEs. 
3.2.3.  The Force Provider, assigned to the MAJCOM/A3, may pare and tailor UTCs if 
required, carefully balancing mission requirements and airlift limitations. The desired effect 
shapes personnel and equipment decisions, and UTCs may be tailored to achieve the desired 
effect. 
3.2.4.  Unique unit capabilities exceeding or modifying those outlined in this instruction may 
still be required to perform MAJCOM-specific missions. These alternative capabilities shall 
build upon and not degrade CR’s OPEN FE capability. (T-2) 
3.2.5.  CR FEFPs are designed as a single weapons system. 
3.2.6.  When tasked, CR forces should deploy as either a CRE or CRT FEFP. Planners should 
not separately task CR UTCs belonging to the same operational capability package for different 
operations, as it will degrade capabilities. 
3.2.7.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief is the final mission authority and makes decisions 
not explicitly assigned to a higher-level authority. The CRE Commander or CRT Chief is the 
primary liaison with the host nation, coalition or other U.S. forces, the supported command, 
and/or controlling agency. Unless otherwise indicated, the CRE Commander or CRT Chief 
may delegate specific duties to other team members as necessary. 
3.2.8.  The deployed CRE or CRT will be led by a trained and certified CRE Commander or 
CRT Chief in accordance with Chapter 4 of this instruction. (T-2) 
3.2.9.  An O-6 will perform duties as CRE/Joint Force Commander for USTRANSCOM Joint 
Task Force-Port Opening (JTF-PO) missions. (T-2) 
3.2.10.  If a senior airfield authority (SAA) is required by the Joint Forces Commander, the 
CRE Commander can be appointed the duties of SAA if they are trained and certified in SAA 
duties and responsibilities. 
3.3.  Specialized Teams.  CR forces are embedded with multiple specialized teams to perform 
airfield and operational assessments, airfield surveys, and aerial port augmentation. Most of these 
teams are organized within the CRE or CRT FEFP. All specialized teams are designed to increase 
the CRE or CRT capability and will be trained and certified in accordance with their AFSC or CR 
duty position training and proficiency requirements listed in Chapter 4 of this instruction. (T-2) 
Examples of specialized teams are, but not limited to: 
16 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
3.3.1.  Assessment Team.  The Assessment team should precede the CR force main body as 
early as possible to verify airfield operations and installation infrastructure and determine 
whether the airfield can support the planned mission. This team is usually the lead element for 
the CR forces; however, it may also be tasked to conduct follow-on airfield assessments to 
support the development of an expeditionary theater basing strategy, evaluate established 
facilities, and recommend opportunities for increasing air operations throughput and mission 
support capabilities. This team comprises personnel and equipment from either the 7E1A1 or 
7E1A2 UTC. Assessment Team personnel will be trained in accordance with the Assessment 
Team CJQS. (T-2) The Assessment Team will: 
3.3.1.1.  Establish contact with the appropriate points of contact (e.g., seizure force, on-site 
Air Mobility Liaison Officer (AMLO), controlling agency, Air Operations Center (AOC), 
Air Mobility Division (AMD), theater planners, U.S. Agency for International 
Development, non-governmental agencies, host base and/or host-nation personnel, and 
Federal Emergency Management Agency), prior to arrival if able, to obtain updates and 
coordinate for potential operating and bed-down locations for CR forces and any follow-
on forces. (T-2) 
3.3.1.2.  Conduct an initial airfield inspection with the appropriate agencies. (T-2) If 
airfield access is impeded, make the Go/No-Go call as soon as possible and keep the 
controlling agency informed. (T-2) Prepare and transmit a Go/No-Go report in accordance 
with Attachment 2, paragraph A2.2.1 of this instruction. (T-2) 
3.3.1.3.  Prepare and transmit on-station report and situation report (SITREP) in 
accordance with Attachment 2, paragraph A2.2.3 of this instruction. (T-2) 
3.3.1.4.  Establish contact with incoming CR force members, pass situation updates, and 
coordinate for further CR force support requirements and aircraft arrival timeline. (T-3) 
3.3.1.5.  Determine and coordinate actions with follow-on or sustainment forces and ensure 
the team continues coordination to prepare for the CR force main body and follow-on or 
sustainment forces’ arrival as needed. (T-2) 
3.3.2.  Survey Team.  The Survey Team can conduct worldwide airfield surveys in support of 
CCMD requirements. The Survey Team provides in-depth airfield information via AF Form 
1174 Airfield Survey, AF Form 3822 Landing Zone Survey, and AF Form 3823 Drop Zone 
Survey. Refer to Chapter 8 of this instruction, AFTTP 3-2.68, Multiservice Tactics, 
Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening, and AFTTP 3-4.13V2, Contingency Airfield 
Operations for additional information. This team is led by a certified Survey Team lead. (T-2) 
It comprises personnel from the 7E1A1 or 7E1A2 MFE to augment with other subject matter 
experts as required to survey locations accurately. (T-2) The Survey Team equipment will be 
pared off the 7E1A1 or 7E1A2 UTCs. (T-2) The Survey Team will: 
3.3.2.1.  Collect, validate, and/or update airfield suitability information and geospatial 
(mapping) data on critical airfield infrastructure key to air operations as applicable in the 
AF Form 1174. (T-2) 
3.3.2.2.  When time permits, a pre-mission analysis of the field to be surveyed should be 
conducted prior to deployment and include a determination on whether a new pavement 
evaluation is required. 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024

3.3.3.  Contingency Support Element (CSE).  A CSE consists of personnel and equipment 
providing specific contingency support capabilities other than core C2 such as joint air cargo 
inspection, aircraft maintenance, force protection, or communications support. They can be 
deployed as an element of a CRE or CRT or as a small-scale, stand-alone capability. These 
teams may require BOS. Unit commanders will designate a team lead for each tasked CSE.

Chapter 5 
CR STANDARDS AND EVALUATIONS (STAN/EVAL) PROGRAM 
5.1.  General.  The Stan/Eval program is the commander’s tool to ensure personnel are trained to 
published standards and remain proficient in their respective functional areas, and validates 
mission readiness and effectiveness, including documentation of individual qualifications and 
capabilities. CR units may have additional capabilities due to unique MAJCOM/ANG 
requirements and organizational structure. Specific program objectives are: 
5.1.1.  Develop and ensure standardization of operational procedures not specifically 
addressed in HHQ guidance. 
5.1.2.  Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative directives. 
5.1.3.  Evaluate, approve, and coordinate change recommendations to operational directives, 
procedures, and techniques as required. 
5.1.4.  Provide a system to assess individual qualifications, proficiency, and capability to 
accomplish assigned CR functions. 
5.1.5.  Recognize trends, and recommend and initiate changes to operational procedures, 
training programs, and directives. 
5.1.6.  Evaluate and recommend changes to standardized training programs and procedures 
used to qualify personnel to accomplish expeditionary air mobility support operations. 
5.2.  Stan/Eval Programs.  Commanders will ensure appropriate programs reside within their 
Stan/Eval function and develop procedures utilizing the general guidance provided within this 
instruction to ensure CR forces are qualified to accomplish assigned, supporting, and/or gained 
MAJCOM/ANG requirements. (T-3) Therefore, unit commanders may define which of the 
following programs are applicable for their forces. The evaluations programs are designed to verify 
successful training completion and that individuals are ready to conduct operations unsupervised. 
Commanders will ensure that all evaluations are conducted by personnel certified as evaluators in 
the CJQS being evaluated. (T-2) At a minimum, unit commanders will insure they have the 
following programs: 
5.2.1.  Review and Certification (R&C) Program.  The R&C program places primary 
responsibility for unit training, upgrade, and certification on the unit commander. Unit 
supervisory involvement is critical to ensure the commander has all available information to 
make the best decisions possible for maintaining unit capability. The commander will 
determine frequency and composition of R&C boards; however, at a minimum, an R&C board 
will take place within a month of a member’s training/upgrade completion. (T-3) R&C boards 
will certify completion of training and evaluations for initial upgrade or requalification in 
accordance with Table 5.1, “Review and Certification (R&C) Board Certification.” (T-3) 
5.2.1.1.  The review portion of the R&C program provides commander oversight of unit 
training. This portion of the R&C program addresses the adequacy of training for 
substandard performance, in-unit upgrades, qualifications, and re-qualifications, as 
determined by the unit commander. 
26 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
5.2.1.2.  The certification portion of the R&C program formally completes the mission 
certification process. This portion provides commanders oversight through formal 
documentation of mission qualification or other specialized training.

2. Certified by the commander who owns the Stan/Eval program. 
3. Wing/CC will certify O-6 personnel. (RegAF Only) 
5.2.2.  Letter of Qualification.  CR units will maintain a Letter of Qualification, or equivalent 
database, documenting CR force certifications and special qualifications for unit personnel. 
(T-2) These will include, at a minimum, the certifications from Table 5.1, “Review and 
Certification (R&C) Board Certification.” (T-2) 
5.2.2.1.  Use a Letter of Evaluation and Certification to record and to certify or de-certify 
members. 
5.2.2.2.  The commander’s signature certifies the Letter of Qualifications. 
5.2.2.3.  Commanders may add additional qualifications to their Letter of Qualifications at 
their discretion. 
5.2.2.4.  At a minimum, the letter will include examinee’s name, grade and organization, 
the duty position for which the evaluation was given, and all examiners’ names for mission 
evaluations. (T-3) 
5.2.3.  Stan/Eval Testing.  Commanders will ensure that the Mission Qualification testing 
program is designed to assess members’ knowledge of USAF, MAJCOM/ANG and 
commander special interest items, pre-mission planning duties, the deployment process and 
emergency actions as required. (T-3) 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
27 
5.2.3.1.  CRE Commanders, CRE Operations Officers, and CRT Chiefs will successfully 
complete an open book evaluation, scoring at least 90 percent before being certified in their 
respective duty position and annually thereafter. (T-3) 
5.2.3.2.  A master question file will be established for each duty position requiring testing. 
(T-3) 
5.2.3.3.  Unit Stan/Eval will review tests and master question files annually for accuracy 
and currency. (T-3) 
5.2.3.4.  Commanders may direct other mission-related testing. 
5.2.4.  Evaluation Program. 
5.2.4.1.  Mission evaluations are conducted at the conclusion of CJQS or JQS training. 
Some mission evaluations require successful completion of an open book test as defined in 
this chapter. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible and minimize the 
number of simulated events. Due to the collective nature of training for some AFSCs and 
positions (e.g., Security Forces, CRT Chief), the mission evaluation is the preferred method 
to validate training completion and ability to conduct operations. 
5.2.4.2.  Completion of the CRE Commander, CRE Operations Officer, and CRT Chief 
CJQS requires either a mission evaluation (preferred) or board evaluation prior to 
commander certification. (T-2) 
5.2.4.3.  Commanders may direct a requirement for an evaluation before certification for 
other duty-positions, including trainer or evaluator qualifications. 
5.2.4.4.  Certification of an individual requiring an evaluation without completion of an 
evaluation is not authorized. (T-2) 
5.2.4.5.  Board evaluations can be conducted in-lieu of mission evaluations. The board 
should be constructed of a panel of core mission experts (e.g., C2, aerial port, 
maintenance), and CR leadership. Boards will be chaired by either the squadron or group 
commander depending on evaluation level. (T-3) 
5.2.4.6.  Trainer evaluations are used to assess the trainer’s instructional capabilities but 
should be conducted during actual instructional missions. When students are not available 
or mission requirements/team composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, the 
examiner may serve in the capacity as a student for purpose of evaluating the examinee’s 
training ability. 
5.2.4.7.  Commanders may direct no-notice evaluations of personnel assigned in their Unit 
Personnel Management Roster at any time. All squadron-directed no-notice evaluations 
will be coordinated with the commander, operations officer, or operations superintendent. 
(T-3) Notification to examinee of no-notice evaluation will be at the discretion of the 
examiner and squadron supervision, but no earlier than initiation of normal planning cycle 
and no later than 1-hour prior to mission departure brief. (T-3) Allow sufficient time for 
scope of evaluation. No-notice evaluations may cover all requirements of a mission 
evaluation but is not required. 
 
 
28 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
5.2.4.8.  Commanders may direct evaluations targeting specific areas but not all aspects of 
a mission. These evaluations shall be identified as spot evaluations and recorded on a 
separate letter of evaluation and certification. This will be documented and presented at the 
R&C board. (T-2) 
5.3.  Conducting Evaluations.  Examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, 
requirements of the evaluation and all applicable evaluation criteria. (T-3) Examiners will then 
evaluate the examinee in each graded area or sub-area. (T-3) At a minimum, units will use current 
MAJCOM/ANG-directed training standards as the evaluation criteria. (T-2) 
5.3.1.  Examiners should not evaluate personnel in their chain of command; for example, a 
flight commander should not give their squadron commander an evaluation or administer them 
an evaluation. Commanders will ensure that deviations are approved, in writing, by the 
examinee’s commander and/or the Chief of Stan/Eval. (T-3) 
5.3.2.  Commanders will ensure that an evaluation is not changed to a training mission to avoid 
documenting substandard performance, nor should a training mission be changed to an 
evaluation. (T-3) 
5.3.3.  Commanders will ensure that early termination of an evaluation (an incomplete 
evaluation) for any reason is clearly documented with a course of action recommended to 
complete the evaluation. (T-3) 
5.3.3.1.  Examiners should make every effort to prevent an incomplete evaluation from 
occurring. 
5.3.3.2.  The examiner for the incomplete evaluation should be the same one used to 
complete the remaining evaluation. 
5.3.4.  The judgment of the examiner and the guidance provided in this instruction are the 
determining factors in assigning an overall qualification level. The examiner will thoroughly 
debrief the examinee and critique all aspects of the evaluation. (T-3) During the critique, the 
examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, and any additional 
training required. (T-3) The examiner will debrief the examinee’s supervisor when a grade of 
U is awarded, or the evaluation is determined to be incomplete. (T-3) 
5.4.  Recertification.  Members decertified by a commander will receive a requalification mission 
evaluation based off requalification training plan approved by the commander. (T-3) If required, 
commanders will ensure that the evaluation is recorded on a separate Letter of Evaluation and 
Certification. (T-3) If the member does not require a requalification evaluation, after 
requalification training is accomplished, the CR unit commander will certify the member as 
requalified on a separate letter of evaluation and certification. (T-3) 
5.4.1.  Commanders will ensure that reevaluations are administered by an examiner other than 
the one who administered the original unsatisfactory evaluation. (T-3) 
5.4.2.  Commanders will ensure that deviations are approved by the examinee’s commander 
and the Chief of Stan/Eval. (T-3) 
5.4.3.  Commanders will direct reevaluation if, in the opinion of the examiner and the 
commander, the unsatisfactory performance warrants not certifying the individual in the 
evaluated duty position. (T-3) 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
29 
5.4.4.  Commanders will determine required items for reevaluation after considering the 
examiner’s recommendations. (T-3) 
5.4.5.  Reevaluations may be completed at home station and commanders will ensure that the 
reevaluations are completed within the commander directed timeline. (T-3) 
5.5.  Reviewing and Approving Officers.  A reviewing officer ensures all requisites of the 
evaluation were met and the evaluation profile, home station and Temporary Duty (TDY) or 
deployment phases were adequate to justify the qualification level assigned by the examiner. The 
approving officer awards the duty position certification to the examinee. 
5.5.1.  The reviewing and approving officers will ensure recommended additional training is 
adequate to correct the noted deficiencies. (T-3) 
5.5.2.  If a reviewing or approving officer does not agree with the examiner's overall rating, 
the overall grade is not changed. The reviewing or approving officer will mark “Do Not 
Concur” or “Do Not Certify”, as appropriate, and annotate comments above their signature 
block. (T-3) 
5.6.  CR Read File Program (RFP).  CR RFP was created to ensure all CR personnel possess the 
most current information prior to any deployment or exercise. Each unit will maintain a local copy, 
while the master is maintained and disseminated by AMC/A34. (T-2) Unit Stan/Eval offices will 
establish a CR RFP to ensure members have read all current CIF information prior to departing on 
an exercise or deployment. (T-2) The CR RFP consists of the following four sections: 
5.6.1.  Section A: CIF. This is a collection of information for each functional area necessary 
for CR force-specific operations. 
5.6.1.1.  CIFs may be issued to CR forces defining restrictions or waivers that could drive 
future publications changes for technical orders or DAFIs that affect mobility operations. 
Actual publication changes must be accomplished in accordance with established 
procedural guidance, to include DAFMAN 90-161. (T-2)  
5.6.1.2.  CIFs can be created at any level; however, must be approved by AMC/A34 prior 
to release. (T-2) 
5.6.1.3.  CIFs are temporary in nature and will include a withdrawal date or timeline. (T-2) 
5.6.1.4.  AMC/A34 will keep all CIFs on file for one year from the date they are withdrawn. 
(T-2) 
5.6.2.  Section B: Contingency Response Bulletin (CRB). This is a quarterly collection of all 
CIFs that have not been rescinded or incorporated in an instruction, HHQ regulation, or 
Technical Orders. CRBs will be published quarterly. (T-2) 
5.6.3.  Section C: Unit Read File. All CR units will maintain a unit read file. (T-3) Information 
within the unit read file will be at the commander’s discretion. 
5.6.4.  Section D: Safety Read File. All CR units will maintain a safety read file. (T-3) 
Information within the safety read file will be at the commander’s discretion.

CR COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS (COMREL), TASKING, AND SUPPORT 
6.1.  COMREL.  The United States Secretary of Defense (SecDef) has assigned 621st 
Contingency Response Wing (621 CRW) forces to the Commander, USTRANSCOM 
(CDRUSTRANSCOM), 36 CRG forces to Commander, United States Indo-Pacific Command 
(CDRUSINDOPACOM), and 435 CRG forces to Commander, United States European Command 
(CDRUSEUCOM). 
6.1.1.  CCMDs delegate operational control (OPCON) and tactical control (TACON) of their 
CR forces to their air component commanders. 
6.1.2.  AMC assigned, supporting, or gained CR forces on Title 10 orders are under 
USTRANSCOM OPCON unless otherwise specified in a SecDef execute order (EXORD) or 
another authorized document. AMC/A3/10 executes OPCON authority over USTRANSCOM-
assigned CR forces on behalf of Commander Air Mobility Command and TACON of 
USTRANSCOM-assigned CR Forces is delegated to the 618 AOC/CC. 
6.1.3.  Gaining CCMDs are responsible for providing FP and BOS outside of CR capabilities. 
6.2.  Tasking.  Air components or other services requiring AMC, AMC-supported, or AMC-
gained CR support, or additional CR forces, will process a request for support (RFS) through their 
respective CCMD Director of Operations, J3, to USTRANSCOM Director of Operations, TJ3. 
Reference Operational Order 23-1, Rapid Global Mobility for more information. 
6.2.1.  Once deployed, CR force capabilities (personnel and/or equipment) will not be 
reassigned to another mission or be given another tasking without the CRE Commander or 
CRT Chief coordinating with and informing the controlling OPCON authority. (T-2)  
6.2.2.  OPCON authority will ensure coordination with the controlling CCMD. (T-2) 
6.2.3.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief will not redeploy personnel without OPCON 
authority approval. (T-2) 
6.2.4.  USINDOPACOM and USEUCOM-assigned CR forces fall under their respective 
CCMD’s OPCON and TACON and normally do not deploy outside of their respective Areas 
of Responsibility (AORs), unless directed by SecDef or to meet an approved RFS. (T-2) 
6.2.5.  CR forces are commanded and controlled by their respective AOC, unless TACON has 
been transferred or delegated, or as directed by controlling OPCON authority. (T-2) 
6.2.6.  Commanders will coordinate with requesting CCMD on FP augmentation and support, 
as CCMD always retains FP responsibility for forces operating within their AOR, including 
CR forces. (T-2) 
6.2.7.  When requirements direct additional CR forces or outside augmentation, the deployed 
CR force designation will be defined by the primary CR unit being tasked. (T-3) 
6.2.8.  Tasking authority (OPCON) will ensure that capability, availability, and utilization of 
CR forces are coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM/ANG CR FAM. (T-2) 
6.2.9.  Equipment organic to CR forces will not be transferred to other forces or commands. 
(T-1)  
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
31 
6.2.10.  Supported CCMD authorities are responsible for tasking follow-on forces to replace 
CR forces and associated support equipment. 
6.2.10.1.  CR forces will not leave any or transfer any equipment without prior approval 
from owning MAJCOM A3. (T-2) 
6.2.10.2.  Plans requiring the CR force to leave equipment (e.g., tents) in the AOR require 
coordination/approval prior to mission execution. (T-2) 
6.2.10.3.  Any loss of CR force equipment will significantly impair the CR forces’ ability 
to forward deploy or reconstitute their limited and critical capabilities. 
6.2.11.  IAW Annex Kilo to AMC Programming Plan 22-01, AMC Security Forces 
(AMC/A4S) must be notified when CR Security Forces are deployed for command functional 
awareness and reach back support. 
6.3.  Response Time.  Commanders will posture assigned forces for rapid response deployments 
into all operational environments in accordance with units’ DOC statement and Immediate 
Response Force (IRF) EXORD. (T-1)  
6.3.1.  Commanders are responsible to ensure their CR capabilities are, and remain, ready for 
aircraft loading in accordance with from receipt of tasking or in accordance with 
MAJCOM/ANG-directive or DOC statement. However, CR forces ready to deploy timelines 
will not surpass 72 hours from notification unless directed by owning MAJCOM A3. (T-2). 
6.3.2.  The installation commander where CR forces are based will establish sufficient mobility 
support and procedures, in coordination with the CR unit commander, to deploy CR forces 
within their prescribed response time. (T-2) 
6.3.3.  CR forces are normally among the first elements deployed during contingencies. For 
this reason, commanders must work closely with host installation commanders to ensure proper 
sequencing and timing of deploying chalks. (T-2) 
6.3.4.  CR forces and host installation commanders will ensure that CR force personnel are not 
tasked to be permanent members of host installation mobility processing units. (T-3) 
6.3.5.  Commanders will ensure host installation processes support deployment of personnel 
and cargo and are sufficiently resourced to support simultaneous processing of two aircraft 
chalks at a time to meet the response timing outlined for CR forces. (T-2) Deployment 
requirements of greater scale for simultaneous processing may require augmentation beyond 
the host installation’s allocated resources. 
6.4.  Orders.  The following special authorizations are approved for inclusion in all mission TDY 
orders (includes AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active-Duty Training/Active Tour, 
used to order air reserve component members to active duty): 
6.4.1.  Travel via military airlift is preferred. Line haul may be directed if more efficient for 
shorter distances. Travel via commercial air may be authorized at the discretion of the tasking 
authority. 
6.4.2.  Multi-Modal lift should only be used as a last resort and when reconstitution timelines 
can be met without impacting follow-on missions or unit readiness. 
32 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
6.4.3.  Commanders will ensure that excess baggage is authorized when transporting required 
UTC equipment. (T-3) 
6.4.4.  Mission essential personnel may be authorized by the appropriate agency for CR force 
personnel traveling to and from deployed locations. 
6.4.5.  Travel and performance of official duties in civilian clothes may be authorized by 
commanders when dictated by FP concerns. 
6.4.6.  If a mission dictates civilian clothing as the primary uniform, CR members may apply 
for allowance in accordance with DAFI 36-3012, Military Entitlements. A personnel 
processing code must indicate civilian clothing must be worn. (T-2)

Chapter 7 
MISSION PLANNING 
7.1.  General.  In the absence of CCMD guidance, the following information provides CRE 
Commanders and CRT Chiefs guidance, information, and requirements. 
7.1.1.  Contingency mission planning is a dynamic process constrained primarily by available 
time. To maximize efficiency and thoroughness, the mission planning process should involve 
representatives from multiple functional areas. Within a short span of time, CR planners must 
identify the mission tasking, analyze all facets of the deployed location and environment, 
determine team composition, equipment, and support necessary, and then prepare the required 
team and equipment for deployment. (T-3) Mission support requests are processed as soon as 
possible to allow thorough coordination and planning. For more expanded planning guidance, 
see AFTTP 3-4.7, Contingency Response, for recommended considerations. 
7.1.2.  Commanders will ensure that proposed tasking of USTRANSCOM-assigned CR forces 
to the USEUCOM and USINDOPACOM AORs are coordinated with applicable theater air 
component planners to ensure compliance with appropriate theater directives and to eliminate 
CR force operational redundancies. (T-2) 
7.2.  Pre-Mission Planning.  When a CR unit commander receives an execution order for a 
contingency tasking, CR forces will recall, brief, mobilize, process home station manpower, and 
deliver materials to the ready line for deployment. (T-2) The planning phase of operations 
normally occurs between the alert order or warning order, and the EXORD. However, short notice 
mission requirements may dictate the planning phase concurrently take place within the unit’s 
allotted response time. CR forces’ Assessment Team may be deployed earlier in the sequence if 
mission requirements dictate. CR forces will maintain the capability to rapidly roll-up, move 
forward, or redeploy. (T-2) 
7.2.1.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief will be responsible for ensuring pre-departure 
planning is complete and adequate to accomplish the mission while providing for the well-
being of CR forces. (T-2) CR units should develop local mission planning procedures that 
clearly define organizational and individual roles and responsibilities and provide systematic 
guidance to ensure the timeliness and thoroughness of planning. 
7.2.2.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief will assemble and brief all deploying personnel 
prior to departure on command relationships, mission objective, operating environment and 
individual preparation required for deployment. (T-3) CRE Commander or CRT Chief will 
ensure that those who cannot be personally briefed are informed sufficiently prior to departure 
to accomplish any items needed for preparation. (T-3) 
7.2.3.  ARC personnel must be on Title 5, Title 10, or Title 32 status prior to executing any 
pre-mission planning, operations, or reconstitution. (T-1)  
7.2.4.  The minimum pre-departure planning should consist of: 
7.2.4.1.  Ensuring ARC members are on Title 10 orders prior to conducting AMC-
supported or AMC-gained operations. (T-1) 
7.2.4.2.  Initiating contact with controlling agency, defense attaché office, embassy, or 
planners involved with tasking or requirements. 
34 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
7.2.4.3.  Determining deployed organizational structure and succession of command. 
7.2.4.4.  Ensuring all personnel are qualified to perform assigned tasks. 
7.2.4.5.  Ensuring all personnel are deployment eligible. 
7.2.4.6.  Ensuring all personnel deploying are briefed prior to departure on the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff standing rules of engagement (ROE), theater-specific ROE, the 
law of war, and applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA). 
7.2.4.7.  Finalizing composition of the deploying CR force and ensuring personnel and 
equipment required to accomplish the mission are tasked. 
7.2.4.8.  Accomplishing deployment load plans to include unit line numbers represented, 
accompanied by associated hazardous materials, diplomatic clearance requests, and 
transmission of this information to appropriate sourcing/tasking agency. 
7.2.4.9.  Ensuring the FP plan is completed in conjunction with intelligence preparation of 
the operating environment (IPOE). 
7.2.4.10.  Ensuring a plan to maneuver FEFPs within the AOR using the most expedient 
and advantageous methods available to include joint capabilities such as: sealift, rotary 
wing, and ground transportation. 
7.2.4.11.  Ensuring all deploying personnel are briefed prior to departure on the mission 
objective, operating environment, and individual preparation required for deployment. 
7.2.5.  Planning Guidance to be used in conjunction of CCMD directives. 
7.2.5.1.  Airlift Planning. CR forces follow AFMAN 24-604, Preparing Hazardous 
Materials for Military Air Shipments, Chapter 3 guidelines for deployment. Redeployments 
and exercises may also execute under Chapter 3 to ensure readiness. (T-2) 
7.2.5.2.  Entry Clearances. Commanders will ensure that personnel, country, and theater 
clearances are submitted. (T-2) See the Foreign Clearance Guide for further guidance. 
7.2.5.3.  CCMDs may levy notification requirements upon a military team entering a 
country in their AOR. 
7.2.5.4.  Intelligence Considerations.  Commanders will ensure that intelligence 
personnel are integrated into the contingency planning process and are responsible for 
providing geospatial intelligence support, and threat data for the airfield, AOR and IPOE. 
(T-2) 
7.2.5.5.  Air Traffic Control (ATC) Considerations.  If the mission requires 
augmentation to support ATC, the controlling air component should source sufficient 
resources internally, and/or request supplemental resources via an RFS. Air Force Special 
Operations Command, Combat Airfield Operations Squadrons, or the Theater Special 
Operations Component may also provide ATC support to deployed CR forces if available. 
Planners should also submit requirements for follow-on ATC capability if required. 
 
 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
35 
7.2.5.6.  C2 Considerations.  CR forces possess specific C2 capabilities for CRT and CRE 
mission accomplishment. C2 controllers do not have the ability to receive Emergency 
Actions Messages (EAM), have limited means to receive real time ballistic missile/threat 
warnings, and do not have the capacity for stage management. C2 controllers will 
coordinate with their closest C2 node in the AOR where CR forces will be operating for 
support. 
7.2.5.6.1.  Ensure that deploying CR forces are equipped to maintain secure voice and 
data connectivity with their controlling agency. (T-2) 
7.2.5.6.2.  Ensure a viable C2/Comm Primary/Alternate Contingency Emergency plan 
is in place and sufficient systems and capabilities are available to execute that plan. 
7.2.5.7.  Assessment Team and Survey Team Considerations.  The Assessment/Survey 
Team should gather airfield suitability information by whatever means available. Examples 
include previously conducted site surveys; satellite imagery; previous operations; Base 
Support and Expeditionary Planning Tool; Air Force geospatial airfield databases such as 
the AMC GeoMobility and Geospatial Information Management System; Global Decision 
Support System (GDSS) Giant Report and Airfield Detail; AMC Airfield Suitability and 
Restrictions Report, airfield surveys, LZ surveys, aeronautical information publications; 
and after-action reports (AARs). Commanders will ensure information that cannot be 
verified by the team is annotated as such. (T-3) 
7.2.5.8.  FP Considerations.  For FP requirements, planners must utilize, DAFI 31-101, 
Integrated Defense (ID), and consult the operations order or instruction of the CCMD into 
which they are deploying. (T-0) 
7.2.5.8.1.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief is responsible for ensuring security of 
resources under CR force control at locations and shall utilize the full threat working 
group (TWG), to include local, host nation, sister service, and coalition counterparts if 
appropriate. (T-3) 
7.2.5.8.2.  The TWG will keep the CRE Commander or CRT Chief abreast of FP 
requirements and concerns. (T-3) 
7.2.5.8.3.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief should further incorporate Judge 
Advocate (JA), Security Forces, Intelligence, Air Force Office of Special 
Investigations (AFOSI), civil engineering, EM, and preventative medicine subject 
matter expert under their command into a FP cell for their location when available. 
(T-3) 
7.2.5.8.4.  In accordance with the unified command plan, CCMDs are responsible for 
providing FP within their AORs, including locations where CR forces may operate, 
except for those for whom the Department of State Chief of Mission retains security 
responsibility. During mission planning, the CCMD’s air component TWG or other 
agency should conduct a risk assessment specific to CR operations. If the threat(s) 
exceeds the acceptable level of risk, the Air Force Forces staff will coordinate with 
both the supporting and supported CCMD staff to develop a risk mitigation plan. (T-2) 
36 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
7.2.5.8.5.  When operating in a contested or highly contested threat environment, 
planners will ensure additional Security Force augmentation is tasked and deployed for 
direct CR force support requirements. (T-2) 
7.2.5.9.  Bed-down Considerations.  Bed-down plans should be based on best available 
information from GDSS, AMC airfield database, geospatial airfield databases, etc., 
including at a minimum: CR force bed-down areas, aircraft parking maximums on ground, 
cargo yards, hot cargo parking, and temporary munition storage areas as required. 
Corresponding MAJCOM/ANG Geospatial Engineering Office (GEO) should assist CR 
force bed-down planning by conducting airfield, imagery, terrain, bed-down, and aircraft 
maximum on ground analysis. Bed-down considerations should also factor in: local 
climate, seasonal flood plains, prevailing winds, and history of land usage. These factors 
will impact support facilities such as the dining hall, latrines, and sleeping facilities. Base 
planning should seek to mitigate exposure sources between operational areas and bed-down 
facilities. Consult preventive health personnel for insight and plan IAW DODD 3000.10, 
Contingency Basing Outside the United States, and Defense Health Agency Procedural 
Instruction (DHAPI) 6490.03, Deployment Health Procedures. 
7.2.5.10.  CBRN Considerations.  CR forces maintain limited organic CBRN capabilities. 
Defense, detection, and decontamination requirements will be determined by CBRN threat 
conditions and host base or augmenting capabilities. (T-1) The following is a prioritized 
EM/CBRN capabilities list that will be supported: 
7.2.5.10.1.  CBRN detection and reconnaissance. (T-2) 
7.2.5.10.2.  Provide guidance on personnel decontamination options. (T-2) 
7.2.5.10.3.  Subject matter expert/advisor to the CRE Commander or CRT Chief on 
EM/CBRN. (T-2) 
7.2.5.10.4.  Liaison with host installation or friendly forces counterparts. (T-2) 
7.2.5.10.5.  CBRN warning and reporting. (T-2) 
7.2.5.10.6.  CBRN training for CR forces. (T-2) 
7.2.5.10.7.  Health Risk Assessment for personnel (T-2). 
7.2.5.11.  Support from Outside Agencies.  The CR force may find itself dependent upon 
the host-nation and/or coalition forces for any number of services from fuel to messing 
facilities. To avoid fiscal law violations, the procurement of any support from the host 
nation, coalition forces, or other non-contractor entities should first be coordinated with 
JA. 
7.2.5.12.  Weapons Considerations.  Commanders will ensure that weapons acquired or 
employed by their personnel have received a law of war weapons review to ensure 
compliance with domestic and international law. (T-0)  Additionally, Commanders will 
ensure qualified weapons couriers are appointed in writing for deploying forces. (T-3) 
7.2.5.12.1.  Commanders will ensure that all personnel deploying with weapons are 
briefed prior to departure on the Law of War, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Standing ROE, Theater specific ROE, SOFA and AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of 
Force by Air Force Personnel, if applicable. (T-2) 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
37 
7.2.5.12.2.  Weapons planners should coordinate with JA and/or State Department 
(Defense Attaché Office) early in their planning process to determine what host nation 
weapons restrictions exist, if any, and whether those restrictions should and can be 
loosened through supplemental diplomatic notes or other arrangements. 
7.2.5.13.  Communications Considerations.  Develop a communications plan in 
accordance with mission requirement. 
7.2.5.13.1.  Commanders will ensure that a Satellite Access Request/Gateway Access 
Request is submitted through assigned HHQ frequency manager within the directed 
timeframe and process. (T-2) 
7.2.5.13.2.  CR forces will ensure all required communication security material is on 
hand in accordance with theater specific special instructions (SPINS), annexes and 
communication system requirements. (T-3) 
7.2.5.14.  Weather Considerations.  Utilize assigned weather personnel during mission 
planning to assess environmental impacts to the potential operations area. For operations 
requiring continuous CR force surface weather observations, consider tasking additional 
weather personnel to ensure uninterrupted weather services. 
7.2.5.15.  Augmenting Forces.  Commanders will ensure that associated personnel are 
current and qualified in the duty AFSC for which they are being tasked and meet mobility 
deployment requirements and theater entry requirement. (T-2) 
7.2.5.16.  Medical Clearance.  All CR forces, CR force-associated forces, and CR force- 
augmenting forces should be medically cleared to perform duties for at least 60 days past 
the deployment start date or for the expected length of the deployment, whichever is longer. 
7.2.5.16.1.  Host base and/or unit assigned medical forces will perform medical 
clearance IAW DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health, and DAFI 48-122, Deployment 
Health. (T-0) 
7.2.5.16.2.  Organic medical support coordinates and develops a medical assessment 
plan prior to mission execution. If no organic medical support exists or has not been 
tasked, CR forces will reach out to their MAJCOM, U.S. embassy, or controlling 
agency for medical information to assist in development of a medical assessment plan. 
7.2.5.17.  Equipment Preparation and Accountability.  CRE Commanders and CRT 
Chiefs are responsible for their hazardous declarations and other documentation. 
Commanders will ensure that deployed equipment custodians are appointed prior to 
deployment to ensure positive control of equipment in accordance with DAFI 23-101, 
Materiel Management. (T-2) Commanders will ensure that certified individuals are 
available to prepare and document equipment for redeployment. (T-3) 
7.2.5.18.  Legal Considerations.  JA personnel should be integrated early into the 
contingency planning process and are responsible for advising on all legal matters. Legal 
considerations include but are not limited to the law of armed conflict, ROE, customary 
international law, status of forces rights and obligations, diplomatic note obligations, 
pertinent host nation laws, international agreements, acquisition cross-servicing agreement 
(ACSA), and other logistical support agreements with the host nation or coalition partners.  
Commanders should know their JA office and points of contact (POCs) in the region to 
38 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
provide support on general fiscal law matters, and joint service integration.  Finally, Air 
Force military and civilian personnel shall promptly report possible, suspected, or alleged 
law of war violations committed by or against U.S. personnel, including members of other 
U.S. government agencies, or enemy personnel, and other nations’ military.  (T-0). 
7.2.5.19.  Public Affairs Considerations.  Ensure public affairs and visual information 
documentation plan is completed and any strategic communications guidance is provided 
if available. 
7.2.5.20.  Logistics Considerations.  Logistics planning for CR operations should 
encompass schemes of maneuver beginning at mission planning to deployment of 
personnel and equipment to sustaining to redeployment and reconstitution. The following 
is a prioritized logistics list: 
7.2.5.20.1.  Determine the mode of transportation for the deployment of personnel and 
equipment, to include lead times for procurement.

stock locations within the operating environment. 
7.2.5.20.5.  Determine requirements for ACSA development with host nation. 
7.3.  Employment.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief has responsibility for all tasked 
operations, support personnel, and equipment. Personnel from other units tasked to support CR 
forces are normally temporarily attached and are under the control and authority of the CRE 
Commander or CRT Chief. 
7.3.1.  To every extent practical, relationships with the host base, or supporting unit regarding 
availability of existing resources should be negotiated and formalized through a memorandum 
of agreement subject to a review by the supporting unit’s JA’s office, the CR force legal 
advisor, and CR contracting officer, if applicable. Any necessary relationship with a host 
nation will be coordinated in accordance with DoDD 5530.03, International Agreements, and 
AFI 51-402, International Law. 
7.3.2.  The CRE Commanders or CRT Chiefs are responsible for providing mission 
information, operational reports, and SITREPs to the controlling agency. (T-2) Prepare and

CBRN, high-explosive defense plan, perimeter defense plan, hardening plan, and dispersal 
options. When intelligence or the situation dictates increased CBRN and/or high-explosive 
defensive measures, the commander will ensure that attack detection, warning, and 
notification, as well as personnel and asset protection and contamination avoidance 
procedures, are implemented. (T-2) 
7.3.5.3.  Ensure all personnel receive a BEPO covering emergency notification, protective 
actions, and additional information as needed. 
7.3.5.4.  When personnel deploy with weapons, the FP plan should include emergency 
combat actions and ROE, to include a review of the use of deadly force. JA should brief 
ROE when present.  Nevertheless, Commanders retain the responsibility to ensure their 
personnel comply with the law of war in the conduct of military operations regardless of 
how such conflicts are characterized. (T-0). 
7.3.5.5.  Establish the primary and alternate tactical operations center (TOC). (T-3) The 
TOC is the focal point of CR force operations and usually consists of multiple work centers. 
Its primary functions include C2, FP, air operations and air operations support. Access to

41 
7.4.  Redeployment and Forward Deployment.  CR forces should be ready to move from the 
deployed location, in accordance with the DOC Statement timelines, to either another forward 
location, an intermediate staging base, or to home station to reconstitute. As the OPEN phase draws 
down, the CRE Commander or CRT Chief must look at the deployed forces and determine which 
functional areas can be reduced or eliminated. (T-3) Functions such as maintenance, materiel 
management, and aerial port are directly related to airflow requirements and should only be 
decreased in proportion to a sustained reduction in airflow. To expedite the transition process, the 
CRE Commander or CRT Chief will ensure that synchronization and hand-off with follow-on 
forces begin immediately. (T-3) CRE Commander or CRT Chief will brief incoming follow-on or 
sustainment forces’ commanders on assumption of responsibilities currently assumed by the CR 
forces. (T-3)

station or follow-on tasking locations.  If individuals are detained for legal or diplomatic 
reasons or equipment seized or impounded by the host-nation, commanders will coordinate via 
the chain-of-command to determine the units’ rights under international law, applicable 
SOFAs, or diplomatic notes.  Contact the controlling agency and/or AOC for additional 
guidance. (T-2) 
7.4.6.  If OPCON of a CR force should transfer to another CCMD, in accordance with DAFI 
23-101, Materiel Management, and DAFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Policy, transfer 
of resources can occur 120 days after the equipment enters the theater if CR forces change 
OPCON. Deployed equipment custodians or supply personnel should ensure appropriate 
documentation is completed. 
7.4.6.1.  The CRE Commander or CRT Chief or designated representative will ensure a 
detailed listing of contaminated equipment and vehicles is provided to the controlling 
agency for review prior to developing the redeployment plan. (T-2) 
7.4.6.2.  Regardless of the level of decontamination sustained, residual contaminates 
(undetectable with currently fielded detectors) may remain. The CRE Commander or CRT 
Chief will ensure that controlling agency authorization is obtained to airlift this cargo. 
(T-2) 
7.4.7.  The CRE Commanders, CRT Chiefs, and/or their designated representatives should 
personally meet with key host officials to resolve any final problems or unfinished business.

Chapter 8 
AIRFIELD OPERATIONS 
8.1.  General.  This chapter defines CR airfield operations that are significantly nonstandard and 
the airfield survey program. It establishes operational criteria and limitations for LZ and DZ 
operations. It also establishes authority, responsibilities, and procedures to conduct airfield 
surveys. 
8.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
8.2.1.  AMC/A3/10 is responsible for managing the airfield assessment and survey program 
and determining airfield suitability for all mobility aircraft. 
8.2.2.  Air Mobility Commands Logistics Operations and Civil Engineer Division’s 
(AMC/A4O) GeoMobility is an air mobility focused Geospatial Engineering program 
responsible for providing the Mobility Air Force (MAF) detailed imagery and the sustainment 
of a global geospatial airfield infrastructure (includes drop zones and landing zones) and 
logistics database with sufficient information to identify dimensions of hard surfaces and 
potential obstacles, hazards or limiting factors affecting mobility and mobility aircraft 
operations. It coordinates and integrates with MAJCOM Geospatial Engineering program 
offices and/or Component-Numbered Air Force equivalents, MAJCOM Directorate of 
Intelligence (AMC/A2), AMC’s Airfield Operations Division (AMC/A3A), and AMC’s 
Logistics Readiness Division (AMC/A4R) to provide an initial (pre-deployment) tactical 
airfield picture with supporting Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) and AF 
Form 1174 data. It also establishes standards and procedures for geospatial data collection, 
integration, multi-user environment interfaces, and storage of data that supports Rapid Global 
Mobility. 
8.2.3.  Air Mobility Command Airfield Suitability Branch (AMC/A3AS) is the OPR for 
determining airfield suitability for mobility aircraft operations, updating, and maintaining the 
AMC Airfield Database contained in GDSS, and is the only authority for official mobility 
airfield suitability. Duties include researching available and applicable resources such as host-
nation aeronautical information publication data, pavement reports, airfield surveys, and flight 
information publications to determine airfield suitability for aircraft operations, processing 
completed surveys from Survey Teams, updating the AMC Airfield Database, providing 
consultation to USTRANSCOM and other organizations’ planners regarding feedback and/or 
information necessary for a complete airfield suitability assessment; and determining whether 
a particular airport is suitable for specific mobility aircraft. 
8.2.4.  AMC/A34 is responsible for establishing policy, procedures, and standards to conduct 
airfield assessments, surveys, and survey team training. 
8.2.5.  Unit commanders are responsible for managing, training, equipping and quality control 
of the unit airfield survey program and will appoint an airfield survey program manager 
(1C7X1, 3E5X1, 13M3X or 32E3G) to administer the program, ensure assessment/survey 
team chief and members are properly trained and certified and provide quality control of the 
final airfield survey reports. (T-2) 
 
 
44 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
8.2.6.  AMC/A4R is responsible for setting the theater and is a good resource to provide airfield 
information, coordinate support with theater forces, and request WRM for USTRANSCOM-
assigned AMC forces. AMC/A4R is also responsible for ACSA training and can assist and 
advise CR forces on ACSA execution. 
8.3.  Tasking Procedures.  Since airfield assessments and surveys are normally conducted prior 
to follow-on operations, the tasking process would mirror the process outlined in Chapter 6. 
8.3.1.  With the exceptions of USINDOPACOM and USEUCOM, requestors without organic 
airfield survey capability should forward the airfield survey requests to the CCMD responsible 
for the airfield for validation prior to submission to USTRANSCOM J3. The CCMD forwards 
valid airfield survey requests to the USTRANSCOM Deployment and Distribution Operations 
Center via email. AMC A34 Operations Branch (AMC/A343) will provide a coordinated AMC 
survey/feasibility recommendation to the applicable USTRANSCOM regional branch. 
USTRANSCOM notifies the CCMD if the survey request is supported. AMC/A343 will task 
appropriate CR forces to execute all supported airfield survey requests. Requestors originating 
within USINDOPACOM and USEUCOM shall forward the airfield survey requests to 
USINDOPACOM’s Deployment and Distribution Operations Center and USEUCOM’s 
Deployment and Distribution Operations Center for validation and sourcing of organic CR 
force assets. This is only if the theater assigned CR forces are unable to fulfill the request first. 
8.3.2.  See Attachment 2, paragraph A2.2.6 in this instruction for survey request 
requirements. 
8.3.3.  Requests for airfield capability assessments may come from, but are not limited to, the 
following sources: AOCs, planners, MAJCOM/ANG A3s, accident investigation boards, 
federal agencies (e.g., State Department), U.S. Embassies, intelligence community. 
8.3.4.  A Survey Team may conduct unit funded airfield surveys and/or updates as required for 
training and will inform their assigned controlling agency prior to survey teams departing home 
station. (T-3)  
8.3.5.  Commanders will ensure that training is not conducted in a designated combat zone. 
(T-2) 
8.4.  Landing Zone and Drop Zone Operations.  CR forces can operate LZs and DZs worldwide 
with qualified personnel IAW DAFMAN 13-217. 
8.4.1.  LZSO. LZSOs will operate in a minimum of a 2-member team construct. (T-2) There 
are no duty day restrictions or requirements while performing LZSO duties. The team lead 
must be an LZSO/LZC certified 7/9 level or commissioned officer. If the second member of 
the team is a SrA/5 level, the team lead will monitor all ground-to-air communications made 
by the SrA/5 level. (T-3) 
8.4.2.  LZC. LZ Controllers (LZC) are in addition to LZSO capabilities and provide Visual 
Flight Rules ATC services during LZ operations. LZC is required when air traffic is forecasted 
to be more than 2 dissimilar aircraft or 1 flight of aircraft. Additionally, it is recommended to 
have LZC support during UAS/Suas operations in close proximity to the LZ during aircraft 
operations. 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
45 
8.4.2.1.  LZC duties will only be executed by tower-qualified 1C1 or 13M. (T-3) Crew rest 
while performing ATC services will be IAW DAFMAN 13-204, Volume 3, Air Traffic

AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
8.5.  Airfield Assessment and Survey Program.  The suitability assessment of airfields is based 
in part on information provided by airfield surveys, when available. CR force assessment and 
survey teams, in conjunction with functional area experts, are responsible for conducting airfield 
surveys throughout the world and will document airfield data on the AF Form 1174, to include 
geospatial (GPS mapping) data collection of critical airfields natural and built infrastructure as 
required to support the AF Form 1174. (T-3) It is imperative for a survey and assessment capability 
to possess the versatility to evaluate the entire spectrum of airfield environments, ranging from 
contingency location (CLs) to main operating bases (MOBs). This capability ensures a holistic 
understanding of diverse airfield conditions, contributing to a thorough and accurate suitability 
assessment process. 
8.5.1.  Commanders will ensure that survey data is made available through the airfield 
suitability program administered by AMC as USAF L-Command for mobility operations. 
(T-2) 
8.5.2.  An airfield survey should be a scheduled tasking. It provides an extensive survey for 
support of all air mobility aircraft and missions. These surveys may span from a day to a few 
weeks depending on the amount of data that requires validation. A Survey Team is responsible 
for executing these duties and ensuring comprehensive documentation on either AF Form 
1174, AF Form 3822, or AF Form 3823. 
8.5.3.  An operational airfield assessment may be tailored for time sensitive evaluation of an 
airfield to support a specific air mobility operation. These teams should include forces that may 
liaise with host-nations and other services and agencies for the purpose of advanced echelon 
responsibilities for follow-on forces. Depending on the mission, these forces will either 
complete a tailored AF Form 1174 or an assessment team Go/No-Go report. (T-2) 
8.6.  Accomplishment of Assessments or Surveys.  Airfield surveys are valid for three years and 
should be re-accomplished as required beyond that or whenever significant changes have occurred 
to the airport or the operating environment. Assessments or surveys over three years old are 
maintained for archive purposes only. Landing zone and drop zone surveys are valid for five years 
in accordance with DAFMAN 13-217 and should be re-accomplished as required beyond that. 
Current and expired landing zone and drop zone surveys are maintained on the AMC ZAR 
SharePoint https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/amczar/SitePages/Home.aspx. 
8.6.1.  The Survey Team will provide completed AF Form 1174 and pavement evaluation 
(Dynamic Cone Penetrometer Results) within ten duty days of the requested survey completion 
date. (T-3) If results are needed prior to ten days, the essential information can be provided by 
email, message, telephone, facsimile, or other expeditious means. 
8.6.2.  If results are needed prior to five days, the essential information can be provided by 
email, message, telephone, facsimile, or other expeditious means. To recommend immediate 
changes to protected GDSS airfield suitability information, contact the AMC Airfield Help 
Desk at Airfield.Helpdesk@us.af.mil or DSN 779-3112 or DSN FAX 576-2702. 
8.6.3.  Survey Teams may use USAF standard survey tools and software (e.g., GeoExPt, 
AutoDesk) or Tactical Assault Kit to assist with conducting surveys and producing an AF Form 
1174. 
AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
47 
8.6.4.  Airfield survey final products provided by CR forces are maintained by AMC/A3/10 in 
the GDSS AMC Airfield Database and the Air Mobility Command’s Civil Engineer 
Operations Branch (AMC/A4OC) GeoMobility Geospatial Airfield Database. 
8.7.  AF Form 1174, Airfield Survey. 
8.7.1.  Part I, Airfield Data, provides specific information on airfield capabilities to physically 
handle air mobility aircraft. 
8.7.2.  Part II, Airfield Support, documents facilities to support air mobility operations. 
8.7.3.  The Survey Team, in conjunction with functional experts, may be tasked to accomplish 
part or all the survey, depending on the proposed operation. Commanders will ensure that all 
checklist items are completed or marked “N/A” when appropriate to ensure survey areas are 
properly identified and not overlooked during AMC suitability analysis. (T-3) 
8.7.4.  The AF Form 1174 should be completed in as precise detail as possible. 
8.7.5.  Commanders will ensure that completed AF Form 1174 and contingency airfield 
pavement evaluation report, including Dynamic Cone Penetrometer Results, are emailed to the 
AMC Airfield Help Desk at Airfield.Helpdesk@us.af.mil, AMC/A4O at Org.AMCA4-
42@us.af.mil, and AMC/A4R at amc.a4.a4.rx@us.af.mil. (T-2) Each unit conducting a 
survey will retain a copy for backup and archive purposes until superseded by a newer survey. 
(T-3) AMC/A4O reviews Dynamic Cone Penetrometer results to validate Pavement 
Classification Number on AF Form 1174. 
8.8.  Airfield Survey Database.  AF Form 1174 is used to update the AMC Airfield Database in 
GDSS. Survey Team Chief should also review the database prior to deploying on the airfield 
survey. Notify AMC’s Airfield Suitability Branch (AMC/A3AS) of any discrepancies noted in the 
database. 
8.9.  AMC GeoMobility and Air Force Geospatial Engineering.  Air Force geospatial airfield 
databases (i.e., AMC/A4OC GeoMobility Airfield Infrastructure database) provide Expeditionary 
Site Mapping techniques, tactics, and procedures to Survey Team for creating and updating 
geospatial data on critical airfield natural and built infrastructure. This geospatial data facilitates 
integration of AF Form 1174 collected data, base support & expeditionary planning data, and other 
data sources resulting in a common installation picture or common airfield picture which visualizes 
and synchronizes the airfield environment with GDSS for planning and decision-making 
processes. 
8.9.1.  Geospatial data collection during airfield surveys and assessments are performed by 
Civil Engineer (32E and/or 3E5X1), Airfield Operations (13M), and Airfield Management 
(1C7X1) personnel utilizing hand-held GPS devices. AFMAN 11-230, Instrument Procedures, 
permits the use of hand-held GPS survey, but it becomes a non-standard procedure and requires 
a MAJCOM/A3 waiver.

AFI10-202  25 JULY 2024 
 
8.9.2.  AMC GeoMobility personnel provide airfield, drop zone, and landing zone survey reach 
back support to Survey Teams pre- and post-survey. Support includes assisting in the collection 
of best available imagery, geospatial and airfield data, development of the tactical airfield 
picture, post-processing, and integration of geospatial data with AF Form 1174 data, and 
airfield, drop zone, and landing zone survey map-based support products as required.

Career Field Education and Training Plan—Comprehensive education and training document 
that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum 
core task requirements for a career field specialty. Career Field Education and Training Plans also 
provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field 
training. Within the air transportation career field, the Career Field Education and Training Plan is 
used as a source document to create Air Transportation Standardization Evaluation program 
evaluation checklists. 
Command Job Qualification Standard—Comprehensive task list common to all persons serving 
in the duty position, which describe a particular job type or duty position. 
Critical Information File—A collection of information for each functional area (e.g., aerial port, 
C2 and aircraft maintenance) necessary for CR force-specific operations. Each squadron maintains 
a copy while the master is maintained in Stan/Eval. 
Common Installation Picture—The Common Installation Picture is the standard AF geospatial 
data set that depicts the natural and built infrastructure of an installation. The Common Installation 
Picture is comprised of geospatial data layers in digital format with related attribute information 
and satellite imagery. 
Contingency Response Force—Refers to generic CR teams during mission execution. A CR 
force may encompass anything from the smallest contingency support element up to a full 
contingency response group. 
Contingency Response Group—CRGs are home station organizations that rapidly deploys 
tailorable, multi-role, multi-skilled, expeditionary CR teams, organized to quickly assess and 
effectively open forward contingency airbases and conduct air support operations anywhere in the 
world. CRGs ensure mission-ready airfield assessment teams, airfield operations, C2, aerial port, 
quick-turn aircraft maintenance, weather, intelligence, ATC, security forces, finance, fuels, supply, 
legal and contracting personnel are available to project and sustain combat forces worldwide. 
Contingency Response Element—A provisional, pared and tailored rapidly deployable 
organization established at locations where air operational support is non-existent or insufficient. 
A CRE provides initial airfield operations, command and control, and air support. The CRE may 
also be composed of contingency support elements from various units and deploys in support of 
Special Assignment Airlift Mission, POTUS support, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability 
Training, tanker support, or contingency and emergency relief missions on both planned and “no 
notice” basis. 
Contingency Response Team—Performs the same function as a CRE, but on a smaller scale. 
CRTs are normally led by and enlisted non-commissioned officer certified as a CRT chief. 
Contingency Response Wing—The Air Forces global reach crisis response force. The CRW is a 
home station organization that rapidly deploys tailorable, multi-role, multi-skilled, expeditionary 
mobility teams, organized to quickly assess and effectively open forward contingency airbases and 
conduct air mobility support operations anywhere in the world. The CRW ensures mission-ready
