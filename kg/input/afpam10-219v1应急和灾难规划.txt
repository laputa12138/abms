This pamphlet supports AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force Program and AFI 10-21 1,
Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning. It discusses contingencies for which civil engineers must
be prepared. It contains practical information to help unit-level civil engineers plan their responses to con-
tingencies, disasters, war, and other military operations. It explains how to identify requirements and get
resources; to organize civil engineer response teams; and to train and exercise those teams. It concludes
by presenting a brief history of Air Force Civil Engineers. It applies to all Civil Engineers, including Air
National Guard (ANG) units and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This pamphlet has been updated and changed to add significant historic accomplishments of United States
Air Force (USAF) civil engineer (CE) personnel during the 1990s through 2007; specifically in regards to
Operations ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM  and IRAQI FREEDOM. Significant changes
were incorporated regarding planning for deployments supporting other than USAF units, terrorist threats
and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield expl osives (CBRNE) events. The update
also incorporates Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) guidance for planners as related to
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-5 ) mandating the use of the National Response Plan
and National Incident Management System as planning source documents. tified Current, 17 September 2013

Chapter 1  
DISASTERS AND CONTINGENCIES 
1.1.  Introduction. Contingencies and crises arrive with many names – natural disasters, accidents, terror-
ist actions, war, and military operations other than war. In colloquial English, a contingency is something
that can happen, but that generally is not anticipated, while a disaster is generally defined by the outcome
of a specific contingency. Hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes and successful terrorist attack are generally
disastrous when they impact our installations or local community. Disasters are not measured by the chain
of results, only the final impact. Who/What was hurt, damaged, destroyed or lost and how long will it take
to restore full mission capabilities? Only rarely, can humans prevent them or control their intensity. How-
ever, we can minimize their ef fects and should always be ready to respond through the development of
various contingency plans. A conti ngency plan is a set of  procedures prepared in advance to respond to
specific or multiple contingencies the base and unit may face. Many pl ans fail due to restrictive think-
ing—“that’s never happened”—and for failure to think outside the box. A good plan is tailored to the base
or unit specific situation and looks at contingencies and second to thir d order effects. Likewise, a good
plan does not look so far outside the box that it includes things that will not happen or is too unwieldy. For
instance, if assigned to Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, a plan is not required for hurricanes or tidal waves,
but would include winter storms that bases in tropical areas would not consider. By anticipating problems
and planning for them, the base and unit can rapidly mobilize the technical, financial, administrative, and
engineering resources needed to minimize detrimental impact to the base. For CE units to respond effec-
tively to emergencies, contingencies and disasters, procedures and plans must be in place when the inci-
dent occurs. Effective post-disaster or post-attack response begins with planning and base preparations
well before a crisis threatens. The chaotic environment following a disaster or an attack is not the time or
place to begin thinking about how to respond. This pa mphlet will help you plan for contingencies and
disasters and lay out ways to minimize their impact on the mission and the personnel at your installation. 
1.2.  Overview. This chapter outlines what  civil engineer units must do to prepare for a contingency. It
begins with an overview of potential disasters—natu ral, man-made and hostile actions—that civil engi-
neers may encounter and the potential effects that accompany such events. The remainder of the chapter
outlines AF responses to disasters and outlines the differences of an on-base response versus a response in
support of the local community or external government agency. Ultimately, our focus is to “hammer
home” the importance of predisaster planning and th e direct effect it has on successful contingency
responses. 
1.3.  Natural Disaster. Natural disasters are defined as any emergency that occurs due to an act of nature.
Natural disasters include hurricanes (cyclones and typhoons), tornadoes, blizzards, floods, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, tidal waves (tsunamis), wildfires and severe drought. Table 1.1. lists damage that can
be expected for the different strengths of natural disasters. The following paragraphs describe the causes
and effects of some of these natural disasters and give civil engineer personnel some examples and poten-
tial effects they may have on personnel, resources and the base.

1.3.1.  Hurricanes. A hurricane (c alled a typhoon or trop ical cyclone when formed in the Pacific
Ocean west of the International Dateline or a cyclone in the Indian Ocean) is a potentially deadly and
devastating storm system accompanied by high winds, torrential rainfalls and lightning. Military per-
sonnel assigned to any coastal region of the world could face preparing for and recovering after a hur-
ricane/typhoon. Historically, hurricanes are some of the most destructive natural events, since they
spawn flooding, tornados and landslides. Table 1.2. highlights some of the major hurricanes and trop-
ical storms that had effects to Air Force bases.

1.3.1.1.  Some of the most noteworthy hurricane /typhoon related disasters occur in third world
countries where construction codes and standards are not as developed as in the US. This situation
results in storms hitting areas where poorly constructed residences are located in flood prone areas
resulting in massive loss of life and property. In 1970, a tropical storm killed 200,000 in East Paki-
stan (now Bangladesh), according to of ficial estimates; unofficial estimates put the death toll as

high as 500,000. Hurricane Camille ravaged the Gulf Coast of Mississippi in 1969 leaving 265
people dead, another 55 missing, and caused $1.5 billion in damage. In 1992, the mega-storm Hur-
ricane Andrew struck the lower tip of Florida and the Gulf Coast of Louisiana (Figure 1.1.). The
hurricane caused over 60 deaths and property damage exceeded $25 billion. In that storm, Home-
stead AFB was severely ravaged with damages exceeding $100 million. In 2005, hurricane Kat-
rina caused an estimated $100 billion in damage wh en it swept across the Gulf Coast facility on
August 29. Keesler AFB suffered extensive damage to its industrial and housing areas as a result
of its sustained winds of 110 miles-per-hour and the base wide flooding reached as high as six feet
in many areas (Figure 1.2.). 
1.3.1.2.  Hurricanes originate in the warm, moist air masses of the tropi cs and move west and
northward with enormous destructive force. The hurricane's most devastating forces are wind, tor-
rential rains, and storm surge. Winds within 100 miles of the hurricane's eye can range from 75 to
200 miles per hour. Lesser, but still destructive, winds may reach out as much as 250 miles from
the center. Rainfall accompanying a hurricane is generally heavy, averaging 5 to 10 inches. Rates
in excess of 20 inches in a 24-hour period have been observed. The extreme tide, or storm surge,
which can inundate the coastline, is especially hazardous. As the storm front moves inland, the
heights of these hurricane tides may vary from 3- to 20-plus feet.

Figure 1.2.  Keesler AFB, MS, Flooding from Hurricane Katrina. 
1.3.1.3.  The destructive force of a hurricane is awesome. High tides, as well as the flash floods
generated by the torrential rains, present walls of wate r which slam into st ructures with great
impact. Devastating winds, accompanied by tornadoes spawned by the hu rricane, create flying
debris and mass destruction over a widespread area. Taking in and converting to energy a quarter
of a million tons of water every second, the average hurricane generates a force equal to 500,000
atom bombs of the Nagasaki-type. 
1.3.1.4.  The hurricane storm surge is a large dome of water, 50 to 100 miles wide, that sweeps
across the coastline where a hurricane makes landfall. Storm surges can easily reach depths of 15
feet at their peak. Along th e coast, hurricane related storm sur ge is the greatest threat to life and
property. 
1.3.1.5.  In 1995 two hurricanes, Erin in August and Opal in October, caused over $100 million in
damages at Patrick, Eglin, Hurlburt, and Tyndall AFBs. Some areas were submerged in up to 18
feet of water as the hurricane forced water ashor e. In 2003, Hurricane Isabel came ashore at the
mouth of the Chesapeake Bay at high tide, resulting in a 20 foot storm surge that flooded Langley
AFB, leaving CE to recover the base (Figure 1.3.).

1.3.1.6.  On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near New Orleans, Louisiana as a
Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 140 mph. The resu lting storm surge, with 20 to 30
foot waves, breached the levees that protected New Orleans from a nearby lake and put 80 percent
of the city under flood water as high as 20 feet deep (Figure 1.4.). Because the storm was so large,
its winds and storm sur ges also caused widespread devastation along the central Gulf Coast,
including Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. The final death toll in Louisiana, Ala-
bama and Mississippi is unknown, but is well-over 1,000—including those deaths directly caused
by winds, flooding and storm surge and those caused indirectly by subsequent accidents, fires and
health issues. The economic impact is predicted to reach as high as $200 billion, including unin-
sured losses. Federal disaster declarations cover 90,000 square miles, an area almost the size of the
United Kingdom. By affecting such vast urban and industrialized areas, Hurricane Katrina has
been called the worst catastrophe in the history of the United States. 
Figure 1.4.  Levee Breach in New Orleans Caused by Hurricane Katrina. 
1.3.2.  Tornadoes. Tornadoes are the most violent weather phenome na known to man. Although the
areas affected by these funnel-shaped clouds are generally limited from 1/4 to 1/3 of a mile wide and
seldom more than 16 miles long, the rotatin g velocities can reach 300 miles per hour ( Figure 1.5.).
Air pressure within the funnel can be so low as to cause buildings to explode from the higher pressure
inside the structure. These high winds and pressure differentials make tornadoes one of the biggest
natural disaster killers in the United States. 
14
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Figure 1.5.  Tornado Moving Across Land. 
1.3.2.1.  During the past 25 years, tornadoes have killed almost three times as many people as hur-
ricanes. Tornadoes occur in all 50 states, but are most prevalent in the Midwest and Southeast.
Although tornadoes occur throughout the year, weather conditions for tornado development are
best from April through June. Unlike other weather disasters, the suddenness and the erratic path
of the tornado seldom afford an opportunity to evacuate the danger area. For these reasons, timely
warning, good predisaster planning and immediate availability of shelters become critical factors
in saving lives and minimizing damage. 
1.3.2.2.  On April 26, 1991, an F-5 catastrophic tornado touched down and tracked through McCo-
nnell AFB. The Wichita/Andover Tornado caused $62 million damage to the McConnell flightline
and facilities, tracking within 2,000 yards of 80 F-16 fighter aircraft ( Figure 1.6.). Tinker AFB
also had tornados touch down in 1948 and 1982  causing millions in da mage. CE units in tor-
nado-prone areas must be ready to respond to not only recover the base but also support local com-
munities when they are hit. 
Figure 1.6.  Tornado Damage at McConnell AFB, April 1991. 
1.3.3.  Blizzards and Severe Cold. Although blizzards and severe cold do not normally cause the wide-
spread structural damage and death associated w ith tornadoes and hurricanes, this type weather can
greatly hamper normal airbase operations. The heavy snows which accompany blizzards cause many
activities to grind to a halt. The build-up of ice makes roads and r unways unusable as well as snaps
overhead power lines. Water supply lines may fr eeze and rupture. Record low temperatures put a
strain on heating systems, causing numerous failures that have to be repaired if operations are to con-
tinue. A significant limiting factor under these conditions will be the reduced effectiveness of person-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
15
nel and equipment required to make repairs in an extremely cold environment. Also, reduced visibility
is a “must consider” factor. Individuals can easily get lost responding to a problem during a blizzard. 
1.3.4.  Earthquakes. An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the Earth caused by the breaking and
shifting of rock beneath the Earth’s surface. For hundreds of millions of years, the forces of plate tec-
tonics have shaped the Earth as huge plates that form the Earth’s surface move slowly over, under and
past each other. Sometimes the movement is gradual.  At other times, the plates are locked together ,
unable to release the accumulating energy. When the accumulated en ergy grows strong enough, the
plates break free causing the earth to shake. Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries where the plates
meet, however, some earthquakes occur in the middle of the plates. 
1.3.4.1.  Ground shaking from earthquake s can collapse buildings and bridges; disrupt gas, elec-
tric, and phone service; and sometimes trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires, and huge,
destructive ocean waves (tidal waves/tsunamis). Building with foundations resting on unconsoli-
dated landfill and other unstable soil, and trailers and homes not tied to thei r foundations are at
risk because they can be shaken off their mountings during large scale earthquakes. When earth-
quakes occur in populated area they can result in large death tolls and extensive property damage. 
1.3.4.2.  Northridge California was struck by a 6.7 magnitude Earthquake on 17 January 1994. The
death toll in this densely populat ed area was 60 with another 1,50 0 injuries. Electricity, gas and
water service was damaged and interrupted for almost 50,000 people. The relatively low casualty
and structural failure rate is credited to US construction seismic codes and superior construction
standards. Although the damage seemed relatively low for an eart hquake of this magnitude, the
economic impact was estimated at $2 0 billion. Conversely, Kobe Japan, exactly one year to the
day later, was hit by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake lasted 20 seconds and collapsed
houses, wrecked roadways, ignited fires and destro yed Japan’s sixth largest city. It resulted in
5,500 deaths, 35,000 injuries, ap proximately 180,000 buildings damaged and 310,000 people
homeless. At an economic impact of $147 billion, the Kobe earthquake is one of the costliest nat-
ural disasters on record ( Figure 1.7.). A December 2003 earthquake in the town of Bam, Iran
resulted in an estimated 50,000 casualties and reduced  and entire city to rubble. Many poor and
developing countries have very few construction guidelines which results in low-grade construc-
tion and weak buildings structures. Good planning, construction standards and federal/local guide-
lines allow the US to minimize damage. Al though CE cannot eliminate earthquake damage,
engineers can significantly mitigate the threat through sound  construction practices and strong
predisaster planning. 
16
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Figure 1.7.  Earthquake Damage in Kobe, Japan. 
1.3.4.3.  A repetition of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake under current conditions would cause
billions of dollars in damage and result in the loss of thousands of lives. The small 1989 Loma Pri-
eta quake just south of San Francisco measured only 7.1 on the Richter scale, but killed 62 people
and damaged property valued over $6 billion. 
1.3.4.4.  Earthquakes strike suddenly, without warning. There is no particular season as with mon-
soons or hurricanes, and they ca n occur anywhere. The state of California experiences the most
frequent damaging earthquakes, while Alaska has the greatest frequency of earthquakes. The larg-
est US earthquakes were felt during a three-month period from 1811 to 1812 along the N ew
Madrid Fault line in Missouri. These 8.0 magnitude earthquakes were felt throughout the Eastern
United States in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas and
Mississippi experiencing the strongest tremors. 
1.3.4.5.  Depending on the magnitude, the primary efects of earthquakes can be dramatic and dev-
astating. Large horizontal and vertical land mass displacements can  create fissures along major
fault lines. Bridges, buildings, da ms, tunnels and other rigid struct ures can be sheared in two or
collapse when subjected to the extreme lateral forces created by earthquakes. Water in tanks,
ponds and rivers frequently overflow their banks. In lakes, an oscillation sometimes occurs in
which the water surges from one end to the other reaching heights sufficient to create a mini-tidal
surge. During the 1964 Alaskan ear thquake, this lake effect caused a tidal surge of six feet in
Memphis, Tennessee, 5,000 miles from the center of the earthquake. The January 1994 Northridge
Earthquake, near Los Angeles, which measured 6.6, injured more than 7,300 people, killed 56
people and caused damage exceeding $15 billion to buildings and roads and ruptured power, water
and gas lines. 
1.3.4.6.  Secondary effects of earthquakes are often more destructive than the earthquake itself.
Landslides resulting from earthquakes in mountainous areas are frequently a major cause of lives
lost. In May 1970, an earthquake registering 7.9 on the Richter scale created a massive avalanche
of the glacier on Mt. Huasaran, Peru. This avalanche started as a sliding mass of glacial ice, rock
and mud 3,000 feet wide and one mile long. The avalanche swept away 11 miles of Earth destroy-
ing the villages of Yungay and Ranrahirca at speeds in excess of 100 mph. The death toll from this
earthquake and subsequent floods was approximately 66,000 people with another 600,000 left
homeless. Fire is often a by-product of earthquakes. The damage caused by these fires can also be
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
17
greater than normal, due to loss of firefighting equipment, blockage of access routes to the fire
scene, and the breaking of water mains essential to firefighting. This was demonstrated during the
San Francisco earthquake of 1906, in  which 80 percent of the half billion dollars in damage was
due to the fires which raged out of control for days following the tremor. Other secondary effects
of earthquakes include disruption of utilities, transportation, and communication systems, and the
creation of tsunamis (seismic sea waves). 
1.3.4.7.  On 26 December 2004, an undersea earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean off the west-
ern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake’s magnitude was estimated at 9.15 and lasted
nearly ten minutes, whereas most major earthquakes last no more than a few seconds. The earth-
quake created a 750 mile rupture in the sea bed, displaced an estimated 20 square miles of water
and triggered a devastating tsunami. A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water is rap-
idly displaced on a massive scale—earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes and large meteorite impacts
all have the potential to genera te a tsunami. The 2004 tsunami was the single worst in recorded
history, killing over 300,000 people (Figure 1.8.). The true death toll may never be known
because tens of thousands were swept out to sea and reported  as missing, while an incalculable
number died from subsequent di sease. Perhaps the most striking exa mple of the power of this
disaster was that deaths attributed to it were recorded up to 5,000 miles from the earthquakes epi-
center. Despite a time lag of several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami,
nearly all the victims were taken completely by surprise. One possible reason: there were no tsu-
nami warning systems in the Indian Ocean. In the disaster’s aftermath, there is a new awareness of
the need for such warning systems and there are proposals to create a unified global tsunami warn-
ing system, to include the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean.

1.3.5.  Floods. Flooding can occur from any accumulation or rise of water on a land area (Figure 1.9.).
Unusually heavy rains can run into streams or rivers causing it to overflow its banks. Runoff from the
sudden melting of accumulated winter snow can add great amounts of water to rivers causing flooding
downstream. The heavy rains and storm surge which accompany hurricanes can cause flooding of
low-lying coastal areas. Some floods result from th e failure of man-made barriers, such as dams and
levees, which attempted to control water flow. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
19
Figure 1.9.  Flooded Homes in New Orleans After Hurricane Katrina. 
1.3.5.1.  The primary effects of floods are due to inundation and the force of the currents. Flood-
water and current-borne debris can drown, displace, or injure local residents. These same currents
and debris can cause structural damage to bridges, buildings, and ro ads as well as interrupt vital
utility services over a large area. Health hazards can be created through disruption of water and
sanitary systems. Electrical fires can be caused by short circuits and the hazard of fire or explosion
can be increased from broken gas mains. Environmental and public health hazards are created
when chemical storage facilities are damaged. 
1.3.5.2.  Floods may occur at any time of the year. They are more common because of heavy win-
ter rains or the spring thaw of accumulated ice and snow in the United States. The warmer, more
humid regions of the world often experience flooding during the monsoonal or rainy seasons. The
duration of a flood's impact varies. Flash floods generally rise rapidly over a period of just a few
hours and subside just as quickly, while floods in the great river basins may last for weeks. In the
great flood of 1993, the Mississippi River exceeded flood stage in some areas for over 100 days. 
1.3.6.  Volcanic Activity. Volcanoes are a rare but a very potent menace. Some 80 percent of all volca-
noes are contained in the "ring of  fire" which circumscribes the Pacific Ocean. Active volcanoes in
these areas are few in number, and the areas near most active volcanoes are sparsely populated. How-
ever, as Mount St. Helens in Washington State (Figure 1.10.) proved in 1980 and Mount Pinatubo in
the Philippines (Figure 1.11.) in June 1991, even inactive volcanoes should be considered as only dor-
mant and a potential source of danger. The Pinatubo explosion caused over $300 million in base dam-
age at Clark AB and contributed to its closure and that of nearby Subic Naval Base.

Figure 1.10.  Mount St Helens Eruption, May 1980. 
Figure 1.11.  CE Break Area at Mount Pinatubo Recovery, Clark AB. 
1.3.6.1.  The underlying cause of volcanoes is the formation of molten rock (magma) through the
process of orogenesis (mountain building). Shifting rocks are forced to great depths, where
increased temperature and pressure cause them to dissol ve and be converted to magma. Once
formed, this magma exerts pressure on surrounding solid material. If solid material has fissures
running toward the surface, molten rock will surge upward to form a volcano. 
1.3.6.2.  The major dangers posed by volcanic eruptions are lava flows, airborne clouds of volca-
nic ash, toxic gases, and volcanic mudflows. Because of devastating forces of volcanic eruptions,
reduction of damage has proved to be difficult. Lava flows may be slowed or diverted by strategi-

cally located stone barricades, but major prot ection involves evacuation of personnel and equip-
ment away from the danger zone. 
1.3.7.  Lightning. Lightning is an electrical discharge from mature storm clouds (Figure 1.12.). Light-
ning is one of the deadly off spring of hurricanes, tornados and normal storms. On average, lightning
causes more casualties annually in the US than any other storm related phenomena, except for floods.
Simple training and basic planning can reduce many of the dangers posed by lightning. 
Figure 1.12.  Lightning Strikes. 
1.3.7.1.  In 1996, a single lightning strike  at Eglin AFB, Florida, resulted in the death of one and
injury of 11 Airmen working on the flightline. During natural disaster contingency response,
resources and personnel are limited. Through proper training and planning, CE can maximize the
effectiveness of the response force. 
1.3.8.  Wild Fires. A wild fire is defined as an unplanned fire requiring suppression action. In contrast,
prescribed wilderness fires burn within prepared lines, enclosing a designated area, under predeter-
mined conditions. Due to a severe lack of cleara nce of underbrush and periodic drought years, our
brush lands, forests and foothills are tinderboxes dur ing late summers. Often a series of lightning
strikes or careless actions by humans will result is a series of fires burning in a localized area. 
1.3.8.1.  Air Force firefighters and Readiness/ Emergency Management personnel are often
requested to assist with suppression and planning actions when local resources become stretched
to thin. During many of the California wild fire months, Vandenberg and Beale have found them-
selves with large brush fires encroaching upon the base (Figure 1.13.). 
22
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Figure 1.13.  Southern California Wild Fires, 2003. 
1.3.8.2.  The Base Civil Engineer, Base Fire Marshal, and th e Fire Chief must be prepared to
defend the base from wild fires as well as support local fire fighters when required. Off base sup-
port should be determined well in advance through mutual aid agreements, memorandums of
understanding or support agreements. Military firefighters have matured this concept to include
joint training exercises and operations thereby solidifying a working relationship. This partnership
results in almost seamless operations during an emergency response since all of the parties under-
stand their roles and responsibilities and have practiced them in joint exercises. 
1.3.9.  Conclusions. There are numerous other natural disasters that  civil engineer units might be
forced to contend with in worldwide operations. In planning for contingencies and disasters, the Civil
Engineer and base leadership shou ld consult with local emergency managers to ensure they include
responses to common local contingencies not listed  above. All civil engineers should remember one
important point: never underestimate the destructive force of nature. Effective warning systems are
needed, as is a mitigation plan. The plan should be designed to limit damage or casualties through
pre-planned actions (i.e., site selection, permanent dikes, shelters, etc.) or expedient actions (i.e.,
sandbagging, tying down, shoring up, evacuation, etc.). 
1.4.  Man-Made Disasters. A man made disaster is defined as an emergency that occurs directly or indi-
rectly because of some human acti on. Civil engineer units may be faced with overcoming the effects of
man made disasters that occur on base or off base. This section outlines potential man made disasters and
addresses the anticipated recovery environment presented by each. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) now refers to man made disasters as “technological disasters.” 
1.4.1.  Fire and Explosion. Fires and explosions are closely related disasters. In many cases, a fire rag-
ing out of control in an area where flammable materials are stored can cause an explosion; or, an unex-
pected explosion can spread flame and hot debris over a large area causing the start and spread of a
major fire (Figure 1.14.). While some fires, such  as those caused by lightni ng, can be considered a
natural disaster, the majority of fires start as a result of some human action. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
23
Figure 1.14.  Aftermath of Explosion at Industrial Plant. 
1.4.1.1.  Fires can be grouped into two general categories: facilities and grasslands. The first cate-
gory can range in intensity from those involving man-made structures, facilities, or a small kitchen
fire to a major aircraft or petroleum fire aerospace vehicles and those involving forests or involv-
ing thousands of gallons of highly flammable material. Forest and grassland fires can be an even
greater problem. They can cover thousands of acres, requiring wide dispersal of limited firefight-
ing equipment, and resources. 
1.4.1.2.  Explosions present a threat to personnel near the blast. There is danger from the force of
a blast, flying debris, and intense heat and flam e that may be produced by an explosion. Natural
gas, liquid petroleum, and munitions storage facilities are potential explosion sites. In December
1984, a gas explosion and resulting inferno in a Mexico City suburb demonstrated the destructive
force of these type disasters. A series of explosions destroyed four spherical tanks, each holding
almost 500,000 gallons of liquefied gas, and se nt enormous steel shards spearing into nearby
houses. Flames from the blast shot  more than 300 feet into the dawn sky, instantly engulfing
homes and other structures that surrounded the ga s plant. Subsequent blasts hurled 50-foot-long
propane cylinders into the air, crushing houses as far as half a mile from the explosion site. It was
several hours before firefighters could contain the flames sufficiently to enter the area. When they
finally entered the zone of devastation, they found corpses carbonized in gestures of self-defense.
Some were huddled together; others lay alone in their beds, arms raised in defense. 
1.4.1.3.  Response to a fire or explosion involves both firefighting and rescue of endangered per-
sonnel. The first step is to cont ain the blaze as much as possible and rescue any personnel in the
area. The next step is to gain control of the fire to minimize further damage. After these tasks are
accomplished, major efforts are devoted to completely extinguish the fire. Other civil enginee r
teams may be called on to  support the firefighters. Reconstruction following a fire or explosion
depends on the magnitude of the disaster, but likely, it will require combined efforts of craftsmen
with varying skills. 
1.4.2.  Hazardous Materials and Radioactive Contamination. If allowed to escape into the environ-
ment, toxic gases, harmful chemicals, or radioactive contaminants can pose significant hazards to
24
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
humans. These substances can be accidentally released into the environment at manufacturing plants,
at storage facilities, during transit to another location, or at points of use. Nuclear power plants, toxic
gas and chemical manufacturing facilities, and hazardous materials storage depots have numerous
safeguards to prevent accidents. When these dangerous substances are transported, they are normally
encased in special rupture-proof containers to prevent leakage in the event of a road or rail accident.
But even with all these special precautions, accidents have and will continue to occur. When this hap-
pens, the accidental escape of these lethal subs tances into the atmosphere or on the ground could
result in thousands of deaths. 
1.4.2.1.  The 1984 toxic ga s leak in India serves as an exam ple of how quickly toxic fumes can
engulf and kill thousands. Methyl isocyanine, a deadly chemical used to make pesticides, began to
escape from a Union Carbide plant on the outskirts of Bhopal a few minutes past midnight. Within
an hour, the gas had formed a vast, dense fog of death that drifted over the city, leaving hundreds
dead as they slept. As word of the cloud of poi son began to spread, thousands began to flee the
fumes. 
1.4.2.2.  Many individuals died while fleeing the noxious vapor, while others who had inhaled the
fumes died hours later from the effects, having reached what they thought was safety. By week’s
end, more than 2,500 people were dead, and thousands more suffered permanent blindness or dis-
abling respiratory disorders (Figure 1.15.). 
Figure 1.15.  Clean Up After Union Carbide Plant Gas Leak in India. 
1.4.2.3.  Toxic gases, harmful chemicals, and radioactive contamination can have a lasting impact
on the environment. Some of these substances can render large land areas and water sources unus-
able for years. To minimize the effects of these toxic materials, civil engineers must be prepared to
assist in containment and cleanup activities. 
1.4.3.  Petroleum Spills. Unlike the highly toxic substances discussed in the preceding section, petro-
leum spills are not normally life-th reatening to humans even though they do pr esent a fire hazard.
However, a petroleum spill can have a devastating impact on the environment. Water supplies can be
contaminated, plants destroyed, and wildlife killed or injured. Marine  plants and animals are espe-
cially susceptible to the effects of petroleum spills in or near water so urces and particularly our
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
25
oceans. As with toxic materials, a civil engineer's primary responsibilities will be to assist in contain-
ment and cleanup activities. 
1.4.4.  Major Accident. With humans, accidents are not just possible; they are probable. Around an
airbase, aircraft accidents are always a possibility ( Figure 1.16.). Whether involving a military or a
civilian aircraft, a major aircraft accident could require the assistance of civil engineers. Trained fire-
fighting and rescue personnel could be required to extinguish fires associated with an aircraft crash
and use special skills to rescue persons trapped within an aircraft. If the accident occurs in an inacces-
sible area, rescue and investigatio n teams may require the support of  other civil engineer pe rsonnel
and equipment to gain access to the crash site. However, not all major accidents will involve aircraft.
The possibilities are endless. An accident can be the act that complicates a dis aster by triggering an
explosion, a petroleum spill, or a toxic gas leak. Major accidents requi re multi-unit response by the
base Disaster Response Force (D RF). Minor accidents are handled by responders such as the fire
department, security forces, and medical services. 
Figure 1.16.  Airshow Aircraft Accident. 
1.4.5.  Planning for Man made Disasters. The types of man made di sasters that could occur are too
numerous to make specific plans fo r each. Effective planning in this area consists of evaluating the
base and its surrounding area to id entify activities that have poten tial to develop into a damaging
emergency. After the evaluation, courses of action and prioritized act ivities should be established to
reduce the seriousness of such emergencies, should they occur. 
1.5.  Hostile Actions. Hostile actions, although they can come from ma ny sources, have the same basic
objectives. They are intended to kill personnel, destroy equipment and facilities, and generally reduce the
ability of a base to carry out its assigned combat mission. The following paragraphs highlight the types of
attacks that are expected, based upon the current world situation. 
1.5.1.  Conventional Attack. A conventional attack can take many forms: ground forces supported by
artillery and armored vehicles; ai rborne troops and equipment dropped behind our defenses; high
speed bombers and fighters dropp ing bombs and firing missiles ; and naval bombardments from
off-shore ships or submarines. The primary objective for strikes against our airbases will be to destroy
aircraft and weapons systems, comm and and control systems, and if th at is not possible, then inflict
heavy damage on runways, POL storage areas, and munitions storage facilities. This damage is
26
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
intended to prevent us from being able to launch and recover combat  aircraft, and it is that damage
which civil engineers will be called on to fix first. 
1.5.1.1.  The explosion of a typical bomb or missile produces shock waves and concussion which
can level structures and kill personnel near the point of detonation. Flying debris and bomb frag-
ments or shrapnel can cause severe damage and injury at distances well beyond the impact point.
The extreme temperatures that accompany an explosion can start major fires, particularly if flam-
mable materials are in the proximity of an explosion. If incendiary bombs are used, their thickened
burning agents will create havoc over widespread areas. Other fires may originate from shorted
electrical circuits, ruptured gas lines and fuel tanks, and the spread of burning embers. 
1.5.1.2.  Even after an attack is over, danger still lurks in the form of unexploded ordnance. World
War II history records that approximately 10 percent of all bombs dropped during an air raid failed
to explode, either through some type of malfunction or because they were fused for del ayed
action. Also, buried and exposed mines and sub munitions intenti onally create a very difficult
postattack environment. Regardless of reasons, civil engineer's explosive ordnance disposal
(EOD) and repair crews will have to function in this hazardous environment. 
1.5.2.  Chemical Attack. Often called the poor man's atomic bomb, chemical agents have been devel-
oped to kill and disable opposing forces dating as far back as the ancient Greeks. In this century, dur-
ing World War I, thousands of troops were killed or seriously injure d by the effects of mustard and
chlorine gas as they fought in the trenches of Europe ( Figure 1.17.). Italian Premier, Benito Musso-
lini, ordered the use of mustard gas in several battles in 1936 during Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia. Her-
man Goering, former Marshal of Hitler's Reich, testified at the Nuremberg war crimes trial that the
Germans would have used gas aga inst the Allies in the invasion of Normandy but for the danger to
horses that were a vital part of Germany's transportation system. Major General Alden H. Waitt, Chief
of US Army Chemical Warfare Service at the time, estimated that German use of chemical weapons
would have delayed the invasion by six months and made new landing points necessary. Is chemical
warfare a thing of the past? Although both sides denied it, the use of chemical warfare agents was con-
firmed in the 1980-1988 conflict between Iran and Iraq. Soldiers returning from the front were treated
for severe burns and blisters, a common symptom of  exposure to certain chemical agents. In some
cases, whole villages were affected. Within one week of ending the war with Iran in March 1988, evi-
dence and testimony indicates that Saddam Hussein utilized CW against the Kurds in Northern Iraq,
killing at least 5,000. Further evidence indicates that forces supported by the Soviet Union used chem-
ical warfare agents in Laos, the Khmer Republic  (formerly Cambodia) and Afghanistan during the
1980s.

Figure 1.17.  Casualties from Chemical Attack. 
1.5.2.1.  How will modern chemical warfare be em ployed next? Chemical agents could be dis-
pensed from large and small missiles or rockets, dropped from airplanes in canister-type bomblets,
sprayed from aircraft, or disp ensed by ground troops as they advance on strategic positions.
Regardless of the method, the results would be the same—no mushroom cloud or devastation of
the airbase – only a fine mist or cloud that drifts gently over the area. It could easily be invisible,
odorless, and tasteless. Perhaps individuals would breathe a sigh of relief at  being spared from a
nuclear attack or a blitz of 1,000-pound bombs and return to normal activities. Within minutes,
many people outside during the attack could be dying from massive seizures and convulsions,
while the base and its weapons systems are left intact and undamaged. 
1.5.2.2.  Those who survive the initial chemical attack cannot consider themselves completely
safe. Air Force chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defense operations rely
upon risk-based decision making, individual and collective protection equipment, and integrated
individual, unit, and airbase actions. 
1.5.2.2.1.  Air Force units will retain the ability to operate under all conditions, but will focus
their primary efforts on conducting combat operations under the CBRN conditions expected at
airbases. Single attacks and factors such as the type of agent and en vironmental conditions,
may require wearing protective equipment for several minutes to hours. Multiple attacks, the
use of newly developed chemic al or biological agents, a nd unfavorable weather conditions
may extend wear times or require repeated donning and doffing over extended periods. 
1.5.2.2.2.  Airmen and leaders develop plans and execute attack response actions to limit con-
tamination. They perform immediate and operational decontamination and conduct rapid
post-attack reconnaissance to detect, identify, and/or segregate contaminated resources and
areas. 
1.5.2.2.3.  Personnel should use uncontaminated assets to the extent possible in the post-attack
environment. The UCC directs unit personnel to  accomplish mission essential tasks and stop
non-mission essential tasks. The UCCs monitor the contamination status of people, equip-
ment, and areas. UCCs also instruct unit personnel to minimize movement, especially between
contaminated and uncontaminated zones. Individuals or teams do not enter or exit contami-
nated areas or move contaminated equipment into uncontaminated areas without UCC or EOC
28
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
approval. Personnel go to contamination control areas or reduce MOPP when directed by their
unit or the EOC. See AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional
(NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, for more information on the Air Force CBRN
operational concept. 
1.5.3.  Biological Attack. Biological warfare is not new. The Black Death (plague) was transmitted to
the Europeans in the 1300s when a Kipchak army , besieging a Genosese trading post in the Crimea,
catapulted plague-infested corpses into the town. The British employed biological warfare against the
Indians in the French and Indian War in the mid-1700s. Of all types of warfare, a biological attack is
the most difficult to recognize. At first, it may seem just a routine illness such as a cold or flu. But as
a lot of personnel begin to show  the same symptoms or when th ose symptoms become increasingly
serious and personnel become ill and die, individuals begin to realize they have been exposed to bio-
logical agents. 
1.5.3.1.  Many pathogens can be em ployed as biological warfare ag ents. The effects of these
pathogens range from a minor in capacitating illness to sudden death. Aircraft spray, aerosol
bombs and generators, missiles, infected animals, vials, capsules, or hand dispensers can dissemi-
nate biological agents. The effectiveness of biological agents depends on the targets, the nature of
the military operations at the target, and the weather. 
1.5.3.2.  Combating a biological agent is very difficult. Since there are no suitable antidotes for the
more virulent strains of pathogens, the best defense is to prevent them  from entering the body
through the common routes – nose, mouth, and skin. Outside of the body, these pathogens do not
easily survive. They are killed by variations in temperature, lack of moisture, exposure to sunlight,
and application of various germicides. One of the best defenses against pathogens is to have per-
sonnel don protective ensembles at the first suspicion of an attack. Maintaining good personal
hygiene and physical conditioning, along with keeping immunizations current, go a long way to
prevent infections. Currently, detection of biological agents is very difficult. They are normally
identified only after their effects start showing up. 
1.5.4.  Nuclear Attack. Of all of the types of attacks that may be experienced, the nuclear attack is the
most awesome and frightening. A single nuclear bomb can cause more death and destruction than
thousands of conventional bombs and has the additional effect of making an entire area uninhabitable
for months, or even years, to come. However, with sufficient warning and appropriate precautions, the
devastating effects of a nuclear blast can be reduced. The explosion of two nuclear bombs over Japan
in August 1945, the first and only nuclear weapons ever used against an enemy, caused unprecedented
casualties. Yet, many of these casualties could have been prevented if there had been sufficient warn-
ing to permit clearing the streets, and if the pe ople of Hiroshima and Na gasaki had known what to
expect and what to do. For example, only 400 people out of a population of almost a quarter of a mil-
lion were inside the excellent tunnel shelters at Nagasaki that could have protected 75,000 people. 
1.5.4.1.  A nuclear explosion, like a conventional expl osion, is due to the rapid release of a lar ge
amount of energy all at once. However, with the nuclear explosion, the energy results from rear-
rangement within the central portion, or nucleus of an atom, rather than among the atoms them-
selves as in a chemical  explosion. Since the forces existing between protons and neutrons in a
nucleus are much greater than are forces between the atoms in a molecule of chemical explosive
material, the resultant release of energy is enormous. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
29
1.5.4.2.  Effects of a nuclear attack are numerous. There are extreme blast or shock waves, thermal
radiation, nuclear radiation, and enormous electromagnetic energy. The blast or shock wave is the
most destructive (Figure 1.18.). It accounts for 50 percent of  the expended energy, creating tre-
mendous over pressures and winds that can crumble buildings and other structures for a consider-
able distance around the detonation point. The atmosphere immediately surrounding a detonation
point is raised to temperatures approaching those in th e center of the sun, instantly vaporizing
buildings and people in the area. This thermal ra diation also has the effect of causing secondary
fires and serious burns to exposed persons miles from the point of detonation. Nuclear radiation is
especially intense close to ground zero. The lingering, cumulative effect of exposure to radioactive
fallout can continue to cause death and radiation sickness for days, weeks, or longer following an
attack. In addition, the great electromagnetic ener gy, generated by nuclear weapons, can tempo-
rarily disrupt radio communications and permanently damage electronic components. 
Figure 1.18.  Nuclear Test at Bikini Atoll. 
1.5.4.3.  Radioactive fallout will be the greatest danger during operations following an attack. Per-
sonnel working in contaminated areas will have to be closely monitored for cumulative radiation
doses and complete personal decontamination will have to be accomplished prior to their return to
shelter areas. Additionally, the civil engineer unit will likely be called upon to decontaminate cer-
tain areas of the base so that recovery activities can proceed. 
1.5.5.  Terrorism. While terrorist acts were once mainly viewed as random acts of deranged individu-
als, they have emerged as highly organized operations, conducted with military precision against stra-
tegic activities and targets. September 11th, 2001, brought home the deadly reality of terrorism in the
United States. Nineteen men affiliated with the Al Qaeda network of Islamic or ganizations, high-
jacked four commercial airliners. They intentionally crashed two airliners into the World Trade Center
in New York City and another one into the DOD headquarters, the Pentagon, in Arlington, Virginia
(Figure 1.19.). The fourth plane crashed into a rural field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, follow-
ing passenger resistance. This terrorist attack killed 2,595 people in New York, 189 at the Pentagon
and 45 in Pennsylvania, including everyone aboard the four airliners; altogether 2,986 fatalities. These
were the most lethal terrorist acts ever carried ou t in the United States and most lethal individual
attacks in the world. Al Qaeda had previously been involved in attacks on American targets overseas,
notably American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. Pre-
30
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
viously, an attack was made on the US Marine compound in Beirut in 1983 ( Figure 1.20.). In that
attack, the terrorist crashed a tr uck laden with explosives through the compound fence, killing more
than 200 US servicemen. This incident also demons trated that our future protective measures would
have to go beyond what would stop a reasonable person. This method of attacking US service person-
nel was also used in November 1995 at the United States Military Training Mission in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, which killed seven individuals and again in June 1996 in the bombing of the USAF dormitory
at Khobar Towers, near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 US servicemen. 
Figure 1.19.  Pentagon Recovery Operations after Terrorist Attack. 
Figure 1.20.  Khobar Towers Dormitory in Saudi Arabia after Explosion. 
1.5.5.1.  In the words of former Secretary of State George Schultz, terrorism is “a new kind of war-
fare” and is being practiced with an increasing degree of frequency. No longer is terror the exclu-
sive weapon of the fanatic, terrorism is now endorsed, encouraged, and funded by governments in
an attempt to achieve political objectives. 
1.5.5.2.  It is no longer safe to as sume that only those exposed locations in areas of international
tension are at risk. The world terrorist honors no country's borders, traveling widely to bring death
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
31
and destruction to those considered as enemie s. In fact, terrorists from the Middle East have
boasted that even the residents of the White House should not consider themselves safe from
extremist actions. "Home grown" terrorists are just as deadly. 
1.5.5.3.  The most frightening aspect of terrorism today is that highly technological weapons of
war, once possessed only by  military forces of the world's la rger nations, are now available to
these radical groups. What would happen if sophist icated nuclear, chemical, or biological weap-
ons fell into the hands of thes e unpredictable elements? The consequences, in light of their ruth-
less disregard for innocent human lives, are unthinkable. The 1993 bombing of the W orld Trade
Center in New York, the 1995 release of nerve and bli ster agents in the Tokyo subway, and the
1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City reinforce this point. 
1.6.  Operations Other Than War. With increasing frequency, military forces are used for operations not
associated with combat. Such operations include Operation PROVIDE COMFORT following the Persian
Gulf War in 1991; the peacekeeping efforts in Haiti in 1994; and the rescue, detainment, and housing of
Cuban refugees during both the Muriel Boatlift in 1980 and the over water exodus of 1994. It is difficult
to deliberately plan for these operations since their requirements, timing, and location are unknown. How-
ever, the common threads in many operations are a need to beddown forces or provide a camp for refugees
or disaster victims. These are activities which military forces should be  able to support through normal
readiness activities. 
1.7.  Air Force Involvement. Disasters a nd other crises temporarily cha nge Air Force activities on a
base—but not priorities; the mission still comes first. In a crisis, all base or ganizations must focus on
restoring or maintaining the primary base mission, saving lives, reducing damage, and restoring mission
essential resources. The nature of a crisis dictates the magnitude, the urgency, and the specific responses
of the base recovery effort. In most cases prompt ac tion is mandatory, and a team effort is required to
mount an effective response. But a team ef fort does not just happen. The ba se team has to be built,
equipped, trained, and exercised. The unpredictable nature of crises requires that each base and unit be
prepared for a variety of circumstances. While a base cannot be prepared for every possible crisis, it can
be prepared for realistic worst-case scenarios. A meas ure of a base's preparation is its ability to quickly
adapt to unplanned situations. 
1.8.  Civil Engineers’ Role. Civil engineers play a key role on an airbase. Each day, civil engineer person-
nel support more activities and units on a base than does any other organization. Not surprising then, civil
engineers are involved in more pre- and post-disaster tasks than any other unit. We take the lead in emer-
gency response planning. Engineers assist in vulnerability reduction by constructing shelters, dispersing
equipment, camouflaging facilities, and much more. We assess damage, fight fires, clear hazards, provide
emergency utilities, beddown military forces and disaster victims, repair facility damage, and control and
monitor contamination. 
1.8.1.  Superb civil engineer support is vital for an airbase to perform its mission before, during, and
after a crisis. Effective support of the airbase mission requires each member of the civil engineer team
to be organized, equipped, and trained to react to a variety of contingencies. This is true for everyone
from the commander to the lowest ranking Airmen. It applies to all CE specialties including firefight-
ing, EOD, and Readiness/Emergency Management. The civil engineer's response to disasters and
other contingencies is not limited to  a unit's home base. Mobile engi neer forces must be capable of
providing CE support anywhere in the world on short notice. 
32
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
1.8.2.  While civil engineers are major players, always remember that civil engineers are only part of
the base team. We must work cooperatively with the other base units to plan, prepare for, and respond
to peacetime emergencies, man-made disasters, and war. 
1.8.3.  Engineer forces must be prepared to fulf ill their mission requirements across the broad spec-
trum of conflicts and under a full range of environments. In a ddition to providing essential facilities,
utilities, and support whenever and wherever required to support CONUS and theater operations, CE
forces will: 
1.8.3.1.  Perform emergency repair of war damage to airbases. 
1.8.3.2.  Support force beddown of Air Force units and weapons systems. 
1.8.3.3.  Accomplish essential operations and maintenance functions for existing, as well as addi-
tional bases, facilities, and utilities. 
1.8.3.4.  Provide aircraft rescue fi re fighting (ARFF), fire suppression, and other emergency ser-
vices. 
1.8.3.5.  Perform detection, manage MOPP transition point requirements, collect detection infor-
mation from UCCs, perform risk management assessment, conduct plume analysis, and advise
commanders on contamination risks and recommended mitigation in a CBRN environment. 
1.8.3.6.  Identify, safe, and dispose of unexploded ordnance. 
1.8.3.7.  In the event the decision is made to abandon the airbase; CE will be instrumental in base
denial, which is the functional destruction by any means available of facilities, utility systems, and
equipment to deny their use to the enemy. 
1.8.3.8.  Manage or oversee a ll repair, construction, operation, and maintenance activities con-
ducted by Air Force, Army, wartime host nation support (WHNS), or contractor organizations on
Air Force facilities and installations. 
1.8.3.9.  Augment Major Command/Numbered Air Force (MAJCOM/NAF) staffs. 
1.8.3.10.  Ensure that the mission is carried out in a manner consistent with national environmental
policies. 
1.8.3.11.  Assist in reconstitution of bare base assets following their use. 
1.8.3.12.  Provide installation emergency management support, coordination of incident manage-
ment efforts, incident action planning, and manage the installation common operating picture dur-
ing responses to all installation incidents. 
1.8.3.13.  Support of deploying of aircraft and personnel during wartime. 
1.8.3.14.  Reception of evacuees/casualties from overseas theaters. 
1.8.3.15.  Accomplishment of predisaster tasks to minimize lo ss of life and facility damage in
anticipation of enemy attack. 
1.8.3.16.  Recovery, search and rescue, decontamination and personal support services. 
1.8.3.17.  Assistance to civilian authorities for Civil Defense actions when resources are available,
or as directed by higher authorities. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
33
1.8.3.18.  Minimum operations and maintenance support of mission essential facilities, utilities,
and airfields. 
1.8.3.19.  Support of tenant's wartime essential requirements. 
1.8.3.20.  Support of forces staged in preparation for deployment. 
1.8.3.21.  ARFF and structural fire protection. 
1.9.  Off-Base Support. Disasters are not limited to base boundaries and neither is the Air Force response.
While the base mission has first priority, the Air Force does not ignore the needs of its civilian neighbors.
Historically the Air Force has been  a good neighbor and provided much needed assistance when civil
resources were overcome by disaster. 
1.9.1.  There are numerous examples of this assistance: December 1955 and February 1986, Beale Air
Force Base helped the local communities following catastrophic flooding in the Marysville and Yuba
City communities. In March of 1964, Elmendorf Air Force Base assisted the city of Anchorage in the
aftermath of the devastating Alaskan earthquake. August 1969 saw personnel from Keesler Air Force
Base rapidly responded to calls for aid from Gulf Coast communities struck by Hurricane Camille. In
April 1982, a Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) team from Carswell Air Force Base was
instrumental in reconstruction efforts after a tornado ripped through the town of Paris, T exas. Over-
seas in November 1980, Air Force personnel supported rescue and recovery efforts in Avellino Prov-
ince after the southern Italy earthquake. This history of support continues even today. 
1.9.2.  There are numerous ways that Air Force personnel, equipm ent, and materials may become
involved in providing assistance during civilian emergencies. Under the Homeland Security Act of
2002, the Secretary of Homeland Security is designated the “principal Federal official” for domestic
incident management and is respons ible for coordinating Federal re sources used in response to or
recovery from terrorist attacks, major disasters or other emergencies. Specific Air Force roles and
responsibilities are established in Air Force Policy Di rective (AFPD) 10-8, Homeland Defense and
Civil Support, and further described in AFI 10-802, Military Support to  Civil Authorities. Air Force
resources can also be committed without prior coordination if the local installation commander deems
it necessary to save lives, preven t human suffering, or mitigate great property damage. Reciprocal
agreements between military and civil fire departments and agreements between explosive ordnance
disposal teams and local civil authorities are other ways that  Air Force resources may become
involved in off-base emergencies. At overseas locations, Air Force resources are normally committed
within the context of US and host government agreements. 
1.9.3.  Always keep Air Force support to civilian communities in perspective. Local civil authorities
are responsible for leading the response to disasters in civilian communities. The Air Force can play a
support role, but does not take over. The Air Force only assists when asked by local authorities, but
proper approval must be coordinated through the appropriate command level prior to providing sup-
port. Usually, that assistance is only provided if it will not take away from support of the base mis-
sion—however, the Secretary of Defense can direct otherwise. The authoritative guidance on Air
Force support to civil authorities is found in AFI 10-802. 
1.10.  The Need for Planning. The need for predisaster and preattack planning should already be obvious.
Why then so many words on this topic? Quite simp ly: to emphasize the need. Individuals usually know
they should make plans, but too often do not get around to it. They have good intentions, but they procras-
34
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
tinate. Some, however, do not even see the need to plan. They believe they are smart enough to decide
what to do on the spot. In other cases, they fail to plan because they do not recognize a potential crisis.
Even worse, a few refuse to think about a potential disaster because the cost to reduce the risk is "too
much". No matter the reason, the consequences—and costs—for failing to plan can be staggering. 
1.10.1.  Experimental Evidence. The results of an interesting study by psychologist Alexander Mintz
help make the case for the value of planning. His study clearly showed the wide difference between
planned and unplanned responses in a period of stress. His tests involved 42 experiments with 15 to 21
subjects. Experimental situations consisted of a large glass bottle with a narrow mouth into which had
been inserted a number of aluminum cones. These cones were attached to strings each of which was
held by one of the participants in the study. The idea was for each person to pull his or her cone out of
the bottle. When emergency conditions were simulated, there was an “every man for himself” attitude
and traffic jams resulted. Sometimes only one or two cones were jerked free before the rest were hope-
lessly snarled. As the experiment progressed, participants were given time for prior consultation and
planning. This prior planning elim inated traffic jams and, in one case, all cones were removed in
under 10 seconds. This simple experiment dramatically demonstrates what happens when there are no
plans for possible disasters. Cones get jammed, and strings get twisted. The real life results are much
more devastating—personnel are killed and injured;  resources are destroyed; minor emer gencies
become major disasters. 
1.10.2.  Planning Versus Panic. After the ship T itanic hit an iceberg, Mrs. Dickinson Bishop left
$11,000 in jewelry behind in her stateroom, but asked her husband to run back to pick up a forgotten
muff. Another passenger grabbed three oranges and a good luck pin, overlooking $300,000 in securi-
ties he had in his cabin. Still another passenger carried nothing but a musical toy pig into the lifeboat.
There are numerous cases of people who, in their haste to escape hot el fires, jump from upper floor
windows located just a few feet from a fire escape. Panic causes such strange and illogical behavior,
and it can undermine effective disaster response. While planning, preparation, and training may not
eliminate panic, they certainly can reduce its effects. 
1.10.3.  No Disaster Plan. An example of a disaster that could have been averted with proper planning
occurred in Galveston Bay in 1947. It all began with a few wisps of smoke from a cargo of fertilizer
carried on board the French ship SS Grandcamp. A crewman investigated, but even after shifting sev-
eral bags of fertilizer, he could find no evidence of flame. He tried throwing several buckets of water
in the direction of the smoke, with no effect. Next he tried a fire extinguisher. Still there was no effect.
So he called for a fire hose. The foreman objected, since hosing down the cargo would ruin it. The
captain was informed and he ordered that the hatches be battened down and the steam jets turned on.
Turning on steam to fight fires is standard marine firefighting practice and has been used for many
years. But this cargo of fertilizer was ammonium nitrate which becomes a high explosive when heated
to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
1.10.3.1.  Someone should have known how to deal with this explosive fertilizer. Someone should
have made plans for putting out a possible fire in or near ammonium nitrate. But no one had done
the necessary planning. So, at 0912 on the morning of April 16, 1947, the 10,419 ton SS Grand-
camp and all those aboard were blown to bits. The explosion, calculated as equivalent to 1.25 kilo-
tons of dynamite, dropped 3 00-pound pieces of the Grandcamp three miles away. The blast
flattened surrounding oil refineries and chemical pl ants and set off fires and explosions to othe r
nitrate-filled ships, grain warehouses and chemical storage tanks in the port of Texas City (Figure
1.21.). The accident destroyed one third of the homes in the town of 16,000 and killed at least 576
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
35
people. Additionally, the first explosion killed 26 firefighters and de stroyed all of the city’s fire-
fighting equipment, leaving the city helpless in the wake of subsequent explosions. Property loss
was estimated at $67 million. 
Figure 1.21.  Explosion of the SS Grand Camp, Texas City, Texas 1947. 
1.10.3.2.  As a result of this explosion, and the subsequent more violent blasts, Texas City became
a scene of chaos. Altho ugh local agencies and citi zens of the city worked valiantly to help the
injured and reduce property damage, for the first few hours, their work was uncoordinated. There
was no adequate plan for disaster. 
1.10.3.3.  The head of the city’ s disaster organization stated that they had plans for protection
against a hurricane, but not for an emergency that came without warning like this massive explo-
sion. In fact, in a meeting to expand the disaster organization’s function just three weeks before the
explosion, individuals had scoffed at the idea. 
1.10.4.  An Effective Disaster Plan. An exploding ammunition ship presented South Amboy, NJ, with
a similar situation as Texas City, but the New Jersey community had a disaster plan all set to go into
operation. The community response force immediately executed the plan and shifted into high gear .
Personnel knew where they were supposed to go a nd quickly responded to their assignments. Fire-
fighters were available to control blazes and prevent further explosions. Roadblocks were established
to keep curious sightseers out and provide clear access routes for critical supplies. Effective commu-
nications and liaison channels we re established between the involv ed agencies, as outlined in the
disaster plan. Although property loss was great, lo ss of life was reduced and the emer gency was
brought under control much sooner than the T exas City disaster. The examples in this section cover
peacetime disasters, but there is no less of a need to plan for the contingencies of war. 
1.11.  Summary. Crises can cover a wide range of very different situations. They may be highly localized,
like a tornado or terrorist attack, or they may impact a large area, like a hurrican e or nuclear attack.
Regardless of how different each emergency may be, they have several traits in common. Almost all cri-
ses are very unpredictable and requi re prompt action if lives are to  be saved and essential services
restored. The descriptions of natural disasters, man made disasters, and hostile-actions provide an idea of
36
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
the environments in which civil en gineers must operate following an emergency. The discussion on the
Air Force involvement in crises and the associated civil engineer's role sets the stage for more detailed
discussions on CE contingency response planning.

Chapter 2  
MAKING PLANS 
2.1.  Introduction. Experience and history have shown that actions take n during an emergency, contin-
gency, and disaster response and recovery actions are much more ef fective if planned. Plans help engi-
neers respond to crises and minimize the time it takes to organize and begin recovery actions. The longer
it takes CE units to react effectively—the potential for loss of life and USAF resources is increased. Plans
help focus our efforts so we do the right things quickly and the most important things first. When more
than one person is involved, plans he lp sort out who does wh at and when. Plans, operating instructions,
and checklists are commonly consider ed the products of planning. When  preparing plans, never forget
that personnel—organized, equipped, and trained to respond to a variety of contingencies—are the most
important “product” of planning. This chapter outlines a number of plans that CE is the author, owner or
part of the development team. All plans should cover some very basic areas: 
2.1.1.  Plans should clearly designate a chain of command, roles, and responsibilities of each level of
command, and how authority is transferred (i.e., at what point does the Incident Commander officially
transfer incident command on-scene). 
2.1.2.  Notification list for various responses. 
2.1.3.  Specific training and exer cise requirements for teams responsible for actions outlined in the
plan. 
2.2.  Overview. This chapter discusses contingency pla nning activities that civil engineers can expect to
perform at base level. It lists preparations civil engineers should plan for before a crisis threatens; lists
some of the capabilities needed to respond following a disaster, and also provides brief descriptions of the
major plans which civil engineers must  prepare or contribute to. In each case, the reader is referred to
sources where he or she can find information to help prepare those plans. This chapter presents additional
guidance on the preparation of the CE Contingency Response Plan as well as a discussion of the support
civil engineers get and give to othe r base units. Formal and informal ag reements that impact civil engi-
neers are briefly discussed as are environmental protection considerations in contingency planning. The
chapter touches on the need and value of checklists, discusses whose job it is to plan, and provides hints
on preparing the plans. 
2.3.  Major Planning Efforts. Crises—major accidents, hostile actions, and natural disasters—are unpre-
dictable and full of the unexpected. This unpredictability dictates that a base reduce its vulnerability and
develop flexible responses in adva nce to ensure Air Force operations continue during war and after a
disaster. Because of their significant roles in first and emergency response, and post-attack/post-incident
base recovery, civil engineers are heavily involved in advance planning. This chapter outlines the contin-
gency planning civil engineers are most often called on to do at bas e level and identifies sources to
retrieve additional information for developing plans. The focal point for CE-related contingency planning
is typically the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight with heavy involvement from Fire Emer-
gency Services (FES), Operations, and EOD flights. 
2.3.1.  The four tables that follow contain generic lists that may help stimulate thinking on what tasks
and capabilities are required to be considered during planning efforts. Table 2.1. outlines predisaster
preparations; Table 2.2. highlights postdisaster CE response capabilities; Table 2.3. lists preattack
38

preparations; and Table 2.4. presents postattack capabilities. Do not rely solely on these tables; other-
wise, important preparations or capabilities may be overlooked. To further assist, the tables identify
source documents to find more information on each topic. There are other useful reference materials
on many of the topics, but start with these sources.

2.3.2.  While the CE unit may not be the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for all of the items in
the aforementioned tables, CE does have a unit responsibility for each one. This planning is necessary
for an effective CE response, and the results should be included in the CE Contingency Response Plan
and associated checklists. 
2.3.3.  Planning for any response must automatically include provisions for the personnel/teams, lead-
ership, equipment, vehicles, supplies, and communications needed to perform the task. It should also
include provisions for training and required support from others. 
2.4.  Formal Plans. Considering the Air Force’s worldwide commitment, it should come as no surprise
that there are a plethora of Air Force plans. It is not uncommon for a base to prepare more than a dozen
plans and to support another dozen or so. Unfortunately, there is not a standard list of plans. Major com-
mand (MAJCOM) planning requirements are not identical since the commands have different missions
and geographical areas of responsibility. There are even differences between bases within a command.
Consequently, it is not always easy to find the specific guidance desired. This section provides assistance
with the planning process by highlighting the plans that civil engineers commonly contribute to, prepare,
or use. These plans may not be re quired for all locations; however, there may be required plans that are
not listed. At major bases, the BCE is often tasked to develop separate civil engineer annexes or an appen-
dix to base plans. These annexes or appendices should briefly describe the support civil engineers provide
to satisfy the plans and the support CE requires fro m the other base organizations. Such annexes and
appendices are usually supported by more detailed information in th e CE Contingency Response Plan.
Always contact the base OPR and refer to source documents on each plan for preparation guidelines and
format. The Wing Plans office often prints a synopsis of plans that apply to the wing. MAJCOM war plans
are listed in the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), volume 2. 
2.4.1.  Wing Operations Plans. Each wing prepares operations plans (OPLAN) to show how the wing
will execute its taskings in s upport of MAJCOM OPLANs. Genera lly, but not exclusively, wing
OPLANs cover wartime taskings. OPLANs detail how the wing will fight in support of MAJCOM or
air component command OPLANs. This is mentioned to distinguish these plans from a base support
plan which outlines preparations which the wing must ta ke before hostilities and what actions must
occur after hostilities to “keep the jets flying” while executing an OPLAN. The Wing Plans office is
the OPR for preparing war fighting OPLANs. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and
Guidance, and MAJCOM/air component command OPLANs are th e source documents for wing
OPLANs. 
2.4.2.  Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. At any USAF base, the CEMP
10-2 is the "master" plan for base  level emergency response to physical threats resulting from major
accidents; natural disasters; enemy attack or terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear
or high-yield explosives (CBRNE). This plan outlines actions and assigns responsibilities to agencies
required to cope with catastrophes caused by the incidents menti oned above—especially those that
involve nuclear or other hazardous material. This can be a very useful and versatile document. A plan-
ner can add appendices to the annexes to cover almost any disaster. A few other plans are often incor-
porated in this way. Civil engineers are responsible for preparing this plan, but it requires the input of
many other organizations on base. This plan helps provide the basis on which to build the CE Contin-
gency Response Plan. The directing document for the CEMP 10-2 is AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emer-
gency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. This publication lays out the basic
requirements; however, the MAJCOM may provide additional details. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
43
2.4.3.  CE Contingency Response Plan. This plan should provide detailed guidelines, information, and
direction to help CE personnel to respond to crises. This plan should provide CE-specific guidance for
supporting implementation of the base’s CEMP 10-2 and other base level plan s. Preparing this plan
requires a major effort by the CE unit. A contingency response plan is not required for each separate
operating site at a base. Separate appendices or paragraphs within the CE plan are usually adequate.
At a small base, a remote site or an Air Force station, CE support responsibilities may be described in
pertinent paragraphs of the CEMP 10-2. MAJCOMs ensure CE con tingency response plans are pre-
pared for USAF-controlled bases with contracted civil engineer functions. The directive for this plan
is AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning. 
2.4.4.  In-garrison Expeditionary Support Plan (IGESP). This is an omnibus plan (formerly known as
Base Support Plan) that identifies base level actions required to support MAJCOM operations plans or
contingencies of any kind. An IGESP is usually written to get a base and its units ready for war, but it
is also used to support military operations other than war, such as humanitarian relief. Often this plan
focuses on force beddown and accommodating transient aircraft, units, and personnel. Its purpose is to
integrate all base support requirements. MAJCOMs may permit consolidation of all base-level sup-
porting plans into the IGESP, including the installation CEMP 10-2. Total consolidation can create an
unwieldy plan, so to avoid duplication the IGESP may refer to other base plans. Each MAJCOM sets
the plan format within their co mmand. This is a major plan whic h civil engineer planners should
review. CE directly contributes to many of the annexes: CBRNE defense operations; airbase operabil-
ity; EOD support; base reception; base maps; facility utilization; temporary facility plans. Engineers
also provide inputs to annexes in the plan written by other units. The master source document is AFI
10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning. In addition, refer to the plans which the
IGESP supports. The Logistics plans shop normally le ads development of this plan. IGESP require-
ments are included in the Joint Support Plan for a collocated operating base (COB). 
2.4.5.  Base Reception Plan. When operations plans call for the addition of forces to a USAF-con-
trolled base, there is a need for a reception plan to effectively and efficiently receive incoming forces
by ensuring arriving personnel are provided immedi ate protection from the effects of enemy attack,
adequate living and working facilities; and arranging for the expeditious movement of arriving equip-
ment to unit work areas. Civil engineers help bed those forces down; but even before that, engineers
help determine if existing facilities can accommodate the additive forces or if temporary facilities are
required. To do that, engineers need to know how many and what types of units will be arriving, when
they will be arriving, when they will be leaving if the base is serving a through-put base, and where
they need to work on base. The location of any temporary facilities and utility systems can then be
determined and beddown plans prepared. This plan is normally an annex to the IGESP. 
2.4.6.  Civil Engineer Support Plan (CESP). The CESP is not a stand-alone plan. When used, it is an
appendix to the logistics annex, or separate annex, of unified command war plans and is not normally
included in Air Force p lans. The CESP identifies the minimum essential e ngineering services and
construction requirements required to support the commitment of milita ry forces. Extract the base's
requirements from the unified plan  CESP to incorporate in the IG ESP. To those requirements, add
local construction and facility requirements that the base will satisfy. Explain how all requirements
will be satisfied and any preattack actions that must be taken by the base. 
2.4.7.  Base Dispersal Plan. This plan is intended fo r overseas bases subject to attack. The plan pro-
vides for relocating key assets to secure locations on and off the base. Provisions must be made to be
able to easily recall the assets. This information may be a stand alone plan or included in the IGESP. 
44
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
2.4.8.  Base Denial Plan. Overseas bases that could be attacked and overrun by an enemy force must
prepare a plan to deny the use of facilities, supplies, and equipment to the enemy. The priorities and
extent of denial will be decided by the commander ordering it, taking into account the potential value
of the assets to the enemy. Once the order has been given, the deni al of military equipment and sup-
plies is the responsibility of the using organization. Civil engineers have a big task destroying utility
systems and pavements. A plan is needed to ensure the more important items are denied first. At the
many overseas locations not "owned " by the United States, denial planning is limited to denial of
US-owned assets only. This plan is directed by theater OPLANs. The denial plan may be incorporated
into the IGESP or a warfighting OPLAN. 
2.4.9.  Joint Support Plan (JSP). If deploying to an overseas base operated by the host nation, read the
joint support plan for that base. The plan outlines, among other things, what part of the base and what
facilities are available to deploying Air Force f orces. The plan also specifies  who is responsible for
what tasks and who provides what support. Usually these plans are prepared by the theater MAJCOM
(in USAFE by Regional Support Groups). If planning is tasked to an Air Force support base, the OPR
for this plan is usually the Logistics Plans office. In that case, the support Base Civil Engineer may be
tasked with providing inputs similar to those for a IG ESP. The JSP should also be available from the
gaining theater MAJCOM Civil Engineer Readiness and Emergency Management Office. Copies may
also be available, but probably in very limited numbers, from the reception team provided by the gain-
ing command's sponsor base. 
2.4.10.  Survival, Recovery, and Reconstitution Plan (SRR Plan 8044). This plan (formerly numbered
the SRR Plan 55) provides guidance to improve survivability of the strategic forces and to enhance the
recovery and reconstitution of thos e forces in the event of a nuclear attack on Air Force bases that
have strategic weapon systems. As with all war plans, civil engineers are tasked with providing the
facilities, utilities and services needed to support the base mission. If called for in the plan, some of the
civil engineers may deploy with members of other base units to dispersal ba ses. If the main base is
attacked and cannot support the mission, the deploy ed force is in a positio n to try to recover and
reconstitute the strategic assets at undamaged di spersal bases. The deployed engineers provide as
much wartime CE support—utility operations, damage assessment and repair , weapons safing,
CBRNE monitoring, firefighting and crash rescue, etc.—as they have capability. Because many dis-
persal locations are at civilian airfields, civil engineers may be  able to get support from civil
resources. That support often requires prior agreements. Only bases with a SRR tasking prepare this
plan. The Wing Plans office normally leads the base level planning for the SRR plan. The US Strate-
gic Command Directive 8044 and th e MAJCOM’s supporting plan are the source documents for the
base-level plan. 
2.4.11.  Installation Security Plan. This plan outlin es responses the base s hould take when priority
assets are threatened. In peacetime, the primary threat is terrorist activities; other scenarios include
riot, civil disturbance, sniper, and hostage situations. Civil engineers are called on to support this plan
in many ways such as EOD troops to safe a bomb, firefighters to provide Fire trucks as a psychologi-
cal deterrent, and heavy equipment to block access to  priority resources. Critical facilities may also
require hardening, traffic barriers constructed, and fences and alarm systems installed and repaired.
The Security Forces unit is the OPR for this pl an and the source documen t is AFI 31-101, The Air
Force Installation Security Program (FOUO). 
2.4.12.  Resource Protection Plan. Simila r in purpose to the Installation Security Plan, this plan pro-
vides for protection of non-priority assets and CE support is essentially the same. At bases with prior-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
45
ity assets, the provisions of this plan are often incorporated into the Installation Security Plan. Under
this plan, all base units including civil engineers should make provisions to protect unit assets (equip-
ment, vehicles, supplies, etc.). Civil engineers need to make sure key features of the base utility sys-
tems are not easy targets such as transformer stations, wells, water treatment facilities, pump houses,
etc. Instructions for this plan come from AFI 31-101. 
2.4.13.  Base Defense Plan. The terrorist attacks of 1 1 September 2001 highlighted the fact that all
USAF bases, CONUS or OCONUS, are subject to a potential threat and should prepare a Base
Defense Plan. Although this is usually overseen by  security forces or OS I, civil engineers may be
tasked to provide construction expertise, counter mobility barrier erection and augmentation man-
power for the base defense force. CE should strive to have active representation on the Base Defense
Planning Group as it can result in significant tasking for the CE squadron. The directing document is
AFI 31-301, Air Base Defense. 
2.4.14.  Stop Alert Plan. Every base with aircraft has a Stop Alert Plan. It dictates how the base
responds to prevent unauthorized movement, theft or hijacking of aircraft. It also outlines how the
base may assist aircrews of hijacked aircraft from  other locations. The civil engineer role is usually
limited to support from FES to use their vehicles to block the movement of the aircraft and EOD to
counter any explosive devices that the highjacker may use. The lead for this pl an is the Operations
Support Squadron. Their basic guidance comes from AFI 13-207, Prev enting and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking). 
2.4.15.  Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Emergency Planning and Response Plan. AFI 10-2501 and
AFMAN 32-4013, Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Guide, requires installa-
tions to prepare a plan that outlines how the base responds to the spill of hazardous materials, other
than nuclear and explosives. While the base civil engineer is re sponsible for the HAZMAT plan, it
requires the active support of many base organizations. Rather than a stand-alone plan, it can be incor-
porated as an appendix in  the CEMP 10-2. At overs eas installations, the guiding document for this
plan is AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign Countries. This plan will be familiar to some
personnel by its previous title, the Base Spill Prevention and Response Plan. 
2.4.16.  Energy Contingency Plan. Also called the Energy Security Plan, this plan is developed to
ensure electrical power remains available to priority mission users during and following a disaster.
Many direct mission support functions on an airbase, such as aircraft maintenance and air traffic con-
trol, are dependent on electrical power; civil engineers have the j ob to supply it. This CE prepared
plan outlines methods to protect the power system , to establish independent sources, and to provide
power, including emergency backup, on a mission priority basis. The details of this plan are often
included in the CE Contingency Response Plan. The source document for this plan is AFI 10-211. 
2.4.17.  Base Deployment Plan/Wing Mobility Plan. For bases and units with a mobility commitment,
a deployment plan (sometimes called the wing mobility plan) is prepared to detail the responsibilities
of getting base units ready to deploy. Base units, including the CE Prime BEEF teams; usually prepare
attachments to the base/wing plan that are called mobility operating procedures or deployment proce-
dures. Those procedures and associated checklists specify who goes, what to take, where to assemble,
what to brief, who doe s what, etc. Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron
Engineer (RED HORSE) squadrons develop their own plans, procedures, and checklists. Units wil l
normally deploy as part of a Multiple UTC Group (MUG). The unit may be either Lead or Follow-on.
Ensure compliance with the requirements in AF I 10-401 concerning MUG responsibilities. Generic
information for deployment and mobility planning can also be found in AFI 10-403, Deployment
46
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Planning and Execution. MAJCOM and base supplements are common. Additional information for
CE Prime BEEF teams is contai ned in AFI 10-210, Prime Base E ngineer Emergency Force (BEEF)
Program, AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program, the Prime BEEF Implementation and
Planning Guide, and the Prime BEEF Equipment and Supplies Listings (ESL). RED HORSE guid-
ance can be found in AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program. RED HORSE deployment and employment
information is also contained in the RED HORSE Concept of Operations. 
2.4.18.  Emergency Action Procedures (EAP). This is a classified document. Each level of command,
including HQ USAF, delineates specific time-sensitive actions which subordinate commands are to
take to prepare for war. These actions are usually packaged in the form of checklists. The specific
actions vary with the level of the threat (alert condition). The actions and the method of communicat-
ing which actions are to be taken are called the Emergency Action Procedures (some commands may
use a different term, but the product is essentially the same; e.g., HQ USAFE uses Emergency Action
File). Subordinate units are directed to tailor the EAP and make unit specific checklists to implement
the EAP taskings. CE EAP checklists can easily be included in Annex X of the contingency response
plan. The wing EAP should be  available within the civil engineer unit at a base; if not, contact the
Wing Plans office. 
2.4.19.  Anti-Terrorism Plan. Commanders, down to installation and GSU level, will develop and
implement an antiterrorism (AT) plan. Commanders may use a stand-alone plan or include A T
annexes in their existing force protection plan. Guidelines on AT planning are found in AFMAN
10-401, Volumes 1 & 2. Stand-alone documents (i.e., Standard Operating Procedures, local regula-
tions, or Operations Orders that articulate requirements for AT key elements) shall be replicated in
and/or referenced in the AT Plan. Task appropriate level units for support, ensuring all organic, tenant
and supported units are considered, and receive copies of the plans. See AFI 10-245, Air Force Anti-
terrorism (AT) Standards, for minimum key elements the plan shall address. 
2.4.20.  Medical Contingency Res ponse Plan (MCRP). The MCRP/EOP  establishes procedures for
wartime, humanitarian assistance, homeland security /defense, and disaster response contingencies.
The MCRP describes medical responses to contingency scenarios, clearly addressing planning aspects
of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Additionally, a Hazardous Vulnerability Analysis
will be included. Refer to AFI 41-106, Medical R eadiness Planning and Training, for more informa-
tion on the MCRP. 
2.4.21.  Disease Containment Pl an. The installation commander w ill establish an installation-wide
disease containment plan (DCP) incorporating tenant units, geographically separated units, civilians,
dependents, and visitors (where applicable) to ensure the installation can effectively respond, miti-
gate, and recover from disease outbreaks as a result of biological terrorism/warfare or from naturally
occurring diseases of operational significance.  See AFI 10-2604, Diseas e Containment Planning
Guidance, for more information on the DCP. 
2.5.  CE Contingency Response Plan Guidance. This paragraph offers a few thoughts on preparing and
packaging the contingency response plan. It contains information on plan content and format, supple-
menting the guidance contained in AFI 10-211. Use the standard Air Force OPLAN format  which is
divided into two parts: the basic plan and its supporting annexes. Th at format can be found in AFMAN
10-401, Volume 2. The guidelines on formatting contingency response plans can be found in Attachment
2 of this pamphlet. Bases located in overseas theaters will incorporate the Base Attack Recovery concept
of operation in CE contingency plans. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
47
2.5.1.  The Basic Plan. The basic plan contains seve n sections: references, task organizations, situa-
tion, mission, execution, administration and logistics, and command and signal. When writing or edit-
ing the base plan, keep it brief—save the details for the annexes. 
2.5.2.  Supporting Annexes. AFI 10-211 delineates the annexes which must be used for all CE contin-
gency response plans written by Air Force civil engineers. The preparation of a comprehensive set of
annexes will require the majority of effort devoted to plan development. 
2.5.3.  Relationship to Ot her Base Plans. An effective contingency response plan consolidates CE
taskings that are specified in the various base plans, and it expands on those taskings with additional
details. The contingency response plan should be organized so it is easy to identify initial actions that
civil engineers must take in a contingency. Figure 2.1. shows where in the contingency response plan
to incorporate and expand on task ings from other base plans. The solid lines show the annexes that
contain the details for support of the various plans. This recommended approach is offered to promote
commonality between Contingency response plans. There are ma ny possible variations, but be sure
variations are necessary and “make sense.” The example does not include a complete list of possible
plans. Incorporate these and other plans in the annexes as appropriate to the base. 
2.6.  Support To and From Others. Pl ans should document the support civil engineers provide to others
and the support received in return. Much of that support is obvious and is done routinely every day. This
paragraph focuses on a few not so common tasks. This listing is a memory jogger to ensure these points
are covered during the planning process. Some of th ese items apply more often to overseas Air Force
installations, but not exclusively. Be sure to coordi nate the support required with the supporting unit in
advance. That support should also be documented in the CEMP 10-2 or IGESP.

Figure 2.1.  CE Contingency Response Plan Relationship to Other Base Plans. 
2.6.1.  Mortuary Officer. Few contingencies or disasters would likely cause great loss of life on an air-
base, but war is one. While the li kelihood of a major attack on US ai rbases has diminished, the base
mortuary officer (usually the services squadron commander) must still plan for processing and bury-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
49
ing human remains when the numbers of deaths exceed the base's capability to store the remains or to
ship them home quickly. The Base Civil Engineer should help the mortuary officer pre-identify burial
locations. Make sure the burial sites do not create an environmen tal problem or interfere with other
uses for the proposed sites. If interment is requi red, civil engineers can fu rther help by providing
equipment and operators to help  dig and close the graves. EOD assists during the processing of
remains by removing any explosive hazards/residue contained in the remains. 
2.6.2.  Tactical Deception Officer (TDO). The TDO works for the Operations Group Commander and
has the job of developing plans to deceive the enemy about the use of base aircraft. This can involve
base activities, the physical concealment of facilities, and deceptive use of facilities. Many other units
may be involved to include civil e ngineers. Specific actions vary with the situation. Possible actions
that engineers and others may take are presented in volume 2 of this pamphlet series. 
2.6.3.  Medical Group. Base medical  services personnel are responsible for identifying medical and
public health problems and for recommending corrective actions. This includes contingency response
operations. Good teamwork can prevent a minor health problem from becoming a major impact to the
base's mission. Specific responsibilities of the medical unit, as iden tified in AFI 41-106 include the
following actions: 
2.6.3.1.  Provide professional and t echnical guidelines to DRF personnel and mobility personnel
on the medical aspects of both peacetime and wartime contingency operations. 
2.6.3.2.  Provide technical policy to installati on commanders on protection and operations in
CBRN environments. 
2.6.3.3.  Detect, identify, and monitor CBRN conditions on inst allations and medical treatment
facilities and medical units. 
2.6.3.4.  Conduct food and water vulnerability studies for employment sites and fixed installations
overseas. 
2.6.3.5.  Ensure that applica ble preventive medicine guidance is provided to unit personnel for
deployments and exercises. 
2.6.3.6.  Verify that pre-deployment medical screening and immunization requirements for
deploying personnel are identified and completed. 
2.6.3.7.  Provide self-aid and buddy care training to designated unit trainers. 
2.6.4.  Vehicle Maintenance. In addition to the normal in-shop suppor t, arrange for mobile mainte-
nance and repairs, especially for the heavy equipment. To facilitate this support, attempt to support
them when they need help (e.g., provide them with a generator during a base power outage). Not only
will it allow them to support the base and look good in the process, it will also help ensure CE vehicles
get repaired. In a contingency, contract maintenance is a possibility. 
2.6.5.  Base Fuels. An agreement with this shop to get heavy construction vehicles fueled in the field
is most helpful. Field refueling can save a lot of time and problems. If they cannot help, look into set-
ting up a CE refueling operation; this also applies to refueling emergency generators. 
2.6.6.  Base Supply. Special levels help ensure the critical, but little used and items that are not readily
available from local suppliers are available for facility and utility system repairs when needed. It
requires an enormous amount of funds to maintain special levels; therefore, base supply works hard to
keep those levels to a minimum. A good working relationship with base supply can help make sure the
50
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
items required are stocked. There is no one-time soluti on to this issue; the relationship must be rou-
tinely nurtured by working together and not blaming each other when needed supplies fail to show up. 
2.6.7.  Contracting. A good working re lationship is required with c ontracting personnel in order to
obtain supplies and equipment from local sources in a hurry. Just as important, cooperation from base
supply and the base comptroller is required to ensure the paperwork gets to contracting quickly. 
2.6.8.  Aircraft Maintenance. Aircraft maintenan ce units have equipment th at can prove useful in
times of recovery. One of the most useful items, especially during night operations, is light carts; they
usually have more than any unit on base. They also have air compressors and portable air conditioners
and heaters that may be useful. Ob tain the contact information of the lowest ranking person that has
authority to release the assets. When requesting support, demonstrate how their cooperation will ben-
efit the mission, because they most likely will have to divert equipment from one of their maintenance
activities and live with the consequences. 
2.7.  Formal and Informal Agreements. Formal agreements are sometimes required to “guarantee” support
called for in base plans. Such agreements are usually prepared when support crosses MAJCOM lines, is
from one country to another, or is between military and civilian authorities. An effective agreement spec-
ifies what support will be provided, by whom, under what conditions, and who will pay for what. 
2.7.1.  As a CE planner, know what base agreements are in place, how they are implemented, and how
they can be adjusted or renegotiated. Determine if additional agreements would be helpful and worth
the effort to develop. Agreements are especially important when support is required from uncoopera-
tive organizations. 
2.7.2.  The names of the formal agreements someti mes change, but the purpose remains the same. If
the agreement name is unfamiliar, ask what it is and if CE has a role. The Logistics Plans office is the
base OPR for these agreements in almost every case. Whenever in doubt, start with them. 
2.7.3.  The following is a brief review of common agreements which can impact civil engineers: 
2.7.3.1.  Host Nation Support (HNS) Agreement. The term memorandum of understanding
(MOU) is used interchangeably with HNS Agreement. This is a high level agreement between two
countries. Rarely are base level organizations involved; however, bases may be the beneficiaries.
For that reason, know what support, if any, is provided for the base or deployment location by such
agreements. Some bases have received assured HNS for airfield damage repair (ADR) and for
supplies through this type of agreement. If the Logistics Plans office does not have the answer, ask
the MAJCOM counterpart if there are any such agreements that affect the base. Details that affect
units deploying to a host nation installation can be found in the Joint Support Plan. 
2.7.3.2.  Joint Support Plan (JSP). This plan is a formal agreement between the host nation instal-
lation commander, the USAF commander who will use the facilities, and the USAF support base
commander. It implements more general country -to-country agreements. Consequently, it will
probably not be easy to alter the agreement, nor will it be done quickly. The terms and conditions
in Joint Support Plans differ by country and by base. Guidance for this plan is theater specific. 
2.7.3.3.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) and Mutual Aid Agreements. These agree-
ments are those activities and measures taken by DOD Components to foster mutual assistance
and support between the Department of Defense and any civil government agency in planning,
preparing for, or applying military forces a nd resources in response to, civil emergencies or
attacks, including national security emergencies. As the name implies, they set up arrangeme nts
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
51
where organizations with like capabilities can support each other when called upon in an emer-
gency. Fire and Emergency Services, security forces, and the medical group often enter into these
agreements with their off-base counterparts. A major advantage to these agreements is the speed
in which support can be initiated. Usually only a phone call from one organization to the other is
needed. Agreements are not limit ed to those three fu nctions; arrangements for other activities,
such as environmental hazard re sponse, can also be secured. While wartime support is not
excluded, these agreements will most often be invoked for peacetime emergencies. The guiding
document for these agreements is AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures. 
2.7.3.4.  Host-Tenant Support Agreements (HTSA). These agreements detail the relationship
between a host base and tenant units. The agreement specifies what support the host base provides
to a tenant organization and the responsibilities of the tenant. Because this is a routine peacetime
agreement, there is not usually much in it that applies to emergency situations other than the disas-
ter responses that a base provides anyway (e.g.,  FES). Occasionally, however, there are units on
base that have special capabilities that can be used in a disaster. Two examples are: a mobile com-
munications installation unit has special purpose equipment which can assist in base recovery
tasks: trenchers, backhoes, line trucks, etc; and a mobile air combat control unit may have portable
generators that could be made available. Because of their mobility commitment, these units may
not be available for every disaster, but attempt to get their agreement to participate when they are
available. This agreement is the way to doc ument their commitment. The authorizing document
for the host-tenant support agreement is AFI 25-201. 
2.7.3.5.  Interservice Support Agreement (ISSA). Nearby military installations have capabilities to
respond to disasters. Find out what they can a nd are willing to provide. Let them know what CE
can do. Document the proposed support with an inter-service support agreement. In some cases, a
mutual aid agreement does the same thing. Rememb er that the Logistics Plans office is the OPR
for any agreement. Often, these agreements must be approved by the MAJCOM. 
2.7.3.6.  Inter-Departmental Service Agreement. Occasionally other federal agencies in the area
have capabilities that can he lp the base handle an emer gency. If not already pr ovided for in a
mutual aid agreement, an inter-departmental service agreement can be prepared to formalize any
agreement the base can reach with the other agency. Count on additional preparation time, because
this agreement must be approved above base level. 
2.7.3.7.  Informal Agreements. Informal agreements are probably the most  useful in obtaining
emergency response support and are also the most  common. They are quicker to produce, and a
nod of the head or a handshake is enough to seal an agreement. Certainly, the value of such agree-
ments depends on the personality and integrity of the participants. True, informal agreements are
easier to break than a formal agreement. But in  most cases, except possibly with a foreign host,
they probably achieve the same results (foreign hosts may be willing, but they are often severely
limited as to what they can do without gettin g approval from higher headquarters). The major
drawback of informal agreements is that they do not usually have longevity. When the individuals
who make the agreements leave, it is a dead issue unless their successors continue to embrace the
agreement. Be sure informal agreements with outside DOD agencies are not in violation of law by
coordinating agreements with the base legal office. 
52
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
2.8.  Environmental Protection Considerations. Common sense suggests a base would not write environ-
mental impact statements to wage war, respond to aircraft accidents, or put out fires. But that same com-
mon sense should also indicate that environmental awareness is still important in those circumstances. 
2.8.1.  War and disasters can create unexpected environmenta l problems. How CE responds can
reduce the hazards, leave them unchanged, or increase them. In crises, CE may not have environmen-
tally acceptable choices of action, but should at least understand the consequences of the choices. Do
not use an emergency as an excuse to ignore environmental considerations. That is not smart. Poor
choices can affect the base immediately, such as allowing a toxic ch emical spill to get into the base
drinking water. As a minimum, civil engineer disaster response actions should not make an environ-
mental problem bigger. 
2.8.2.  In planning for disaster and postattack responses, be sure to cover two important environmental
considerations. First, be ready to deal with hazardous materials. Identify the different points on the
base where the runoff of such liquids can be contained. Ideally construct containment devices before
disasters threaten. However, at most bases this is impractical, because there are so many places where
runoff leaves a base. By det ermining where most hazardous materials are stored or transported, CE
can construct containment structures in the few locations likely to do the most good. This prevents any
hazardous material from contaminating the base’s water sources and those of neighboring communi-
ties. Second, also be prepared to handle hazardous or contaminated solid materials temporarily in war.
Identify locations to bury those materials temporarily so that the locations do not interfere with other
base activities. Select sites that minimize ground water contamination from leaching action. Both of
these actions should be covered in the HAZMAT Plan. 
2.9.  Checklists. Once a plan is written or updated, one final planning task remains—and it may be the
most useful one. The CE unit should prepare or revise supporting checklists. Generally, checklists should
be created for each operating instruction contained in the CE contingency response plan. Checklists
should also be prepared for all other CE contingency or emergency support not otherwise covered in that
plan. A good checklist summarizes the tasks specified in an operating instruction or plan; gives each task
(and subtask) a number; identifies th e OPR (who will do the task); and states when the task or subtask
should be started and/or completed (be sure to clarify which). An execution checklist format can be sim-
ple: Task Number (also number subtasks in this column); Task Description; OPR; and Timing (if needed). 
2.9.1.  Prepare checklists for Emergency Operations Center (EOC) positions, unit or damage control
center (UCC or DCC) positions, fire alarm communication center (FACC) telecommunicator, CBRN
control center positions, shops, a nd response teams. It is helpful to use th e same or similar task
descriptions for checklists prepared at every level in the unit for the same threat or emergency. It helps
communication when the DCC talks to a shop about a major accident response, for example, and both
have similarly numbered checklists. The tasks are more general at the control center level and more
detailed at the team/shop level. If an action does not  apply to a team or shop, that number is skipped
in the shop checklist. Tasks can be further divided into subtasks. For subtasks, use the same task num-
ber but add a letter or number su ffix (i.e., 2a, 2b, 2c, etc., or 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc). It is suggested that
checklists are prepared in a format similar to Emergency Action Procedures. 
2.9.2.  Checklists are only memory joggers that outli ne tasks to be performed by each CE DCC staff
member and by each CE recovery or response team for each likely response situation. They give focus
to a team's efforts. They help a team to get moving quickly on a recovery task versus spending valu-
able time deciding what needs to be done. Checklists are especially helpful when tasks are not per-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
53
formed often. They are great for pre-disaster preparations and can help keep complicated recovery
efforts on track. 
2.9.3.  Checklist preparation involves more than one person and each team l eader should write their
own. They can include as  much or as little detail as their team members need. Checklists should
include such points as the tasks to be done; who wi ll do each one; when each task must be started or
completed; what equipment, tools, and vehicles should be used; and, if required, where the task is to
be done. Team leaders should provide copies to the Readiness Flight whom ensures all required
checklists are written. The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight then provides current cop-
ies for the CE DCC and in the EOC. Use local exercises to check the usefulness of the checklists and
benchmark the best to share up, down, and across the CE organization. 
2.9.4.  Keep checklists current. Do not  wait for a plan to be  revised to update or improve checklists.
Update them more frequently than the plans they support because of changes in points of contact, etc. 
2.9.5.  Consider sizing checklists used outdoors to fit into BDU pocke ts and make them water resis-
tant. Flight crew checklist binders (5 1/2" x 8 1/4") work well for this. 
2.10.  Whose Job Is It To Plan? Every civil engineer unit must plan for disasters and contingencies. The
plans for some units can be quite simple, for others they must be extensive. The number of plans and level
of detail included in each will vary with each unit based on mission and exposure to disasters, contingen-
cies, and war. This chapter focuses on the planning done by a civil engineer unit with base maintenance
responsibilities. However, even CE units with only mobility commitments need to understand what plan-
ning is required, so they can better s upport those plans when they deploy. Table 2.5. highlights some of
the planning that CE units  are likely to perform or contribute towards based on their location and base
maintenance responsibilities.

2.10.1.  Good local plans cannot be written at the Pentagon or MAJCOM headquarters and mailed out
for civil engineer units to put in to effect. Local plans must be made using sound engineering princi-
ples, experience, and common sense. Traditionally, the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight
does the CE planning, but in fact, many unit members have a role. 
2.10.2.  Anyone who leads a CE response team should  participate and provide their inputs to each
plan. The CE commander has the option of choosing anyone in the unit to lead the planning effort for
one or more of the plans. This helps spread out the workload and gets more personnel knowledgeable
with the unit response capabilities and requirements. 
2.11.  Hints for Plan Development. This section offers some hints for preparing CE plans. 
2.11.1.  The Process. The planning process is as important as the product. While gathering information
and developing solutions for the plans, much is learned about the unit’s mission, capabilities, and
shortfalls. The knowledge gained from ga thering information about the unit’s mission, capabilities
and shortfalls, and developing solutions for the plans, makes the unit better able to respond to crises.
The more individuals in the process, the more  knowledge expands throughout the unit and builds
depth into the CE “team.” Plans and checklists only document the results of the process. 
2.11.2.  Keep Plans Simple. Good plans do not have to  be elaborate, but they do have to be easy to
understand. Generally, simple plans are better and are easier to follow and more likely to be success-
ful. No plan can cover every co nceivable contingency, and experience shows that no crisis goes
according to plan. Rely on the common sense and good judgment of the personnel to adapt to the sit-
uation. The planning will be adequate if personnel are organized to respond to the crises, know what
to do, and have the resources to do it. 
2.11.3.  Answer Key Questions. T he planning process is essentially an effort to answer a few key
questions. There are many ways to phrase the "who, what, when, where, why and how" questions. 
2.11.3.1.  What does the plan’s OPR want from me? Know the purpose of the plan, what inputs the
OPR expects, and what format to use. The OPR should be able to provide the basic plan or at least
an outline of the information from the standard five sections: situation, mission, execution, admin-
istration and logistics, command and signals. 
2.11.3.2.  What is the threat? What contingencies do engineers need to be prepared for? Identify all
the likely natural and man-made threats to the base and its missi ons. Ideally, that information
should be presented in the situation section of the basic plan. If not available from the OPR,
review chapter one of the basic pl an. It is a good place to start, but contact the wing intelligence
office for terrorist and wartime threats. Threats change over time, so keep up to date. The base
weather office can provide useful data on weat her related emergencies. This should include the
frequency and magnitude of the natural threats. Provide the commander several proposals on what
threats should be included. The commander can often offer valuable insights here. 
2.11.3.3.  For each threat, what is likely to be targeted/damaged and how important is that func-
tion/facility to the mission? Identify the most probable targets and the most vulnerable functions
and facilities for each threat. Anticipate the impact on the mi ssion if those functions or facilities
are damaged. 
2.11.3.4.  What permanent or temporary solutions can be employed to reduce the vulnerability of
the mission-critical functions and facilities? There will never be enough money to properly protect
56
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
the key facilities identified on the Critical Facilities list established through the base contingency
planning group. Efforts should be made to get the most protection for the available dollars. 
2.11.3.5.  Based on the missi on, in what priority should the ba se respond to recovery tasks and
facility damage? This information should be updated as threats or missions change or as hardened
facilities are built. 
2.11.3.6.  What CE capabilities are required to respond to each disaster? 
2.11.3.7.  What resources are needed for each response capability: personnel, equipment, vehicles,
supplies, etc? What is availabl e? Determine resource shortfalls and decide how to satisfy those
shortfalls. 
2.11.3.8.  Who in the unit will be responsible for what tasks and what support? Establish who is to
do what, with what resources and, if possible, when they are to do it. 
2.11.4.  Set Up A Planning Team. Many plans are the result of a few smart personnel thinking about a
problem and developing common sense solutions. Cert ainly, one person can prepare CE plans, but
that is not a formula for success; major advantages are gained by setting up a planning team. As stated
earlier, getting more personnel invol ved in the planning process yiel ds a better-informed unit. The
additional brainpower tends to yield more suggestions and better solutions—and a better plan. In addi-
tion, when individuals feel they are part of the solu tion, they are more willing and better able to exe-
cute the plan or provide support for it. A part-time ad hoc te am works best. Team membership can
change with each plan. The team does not have to meet often. In fact the team members can meet with
the leader and each other only as needed to get guidance, coordinate efforts, and turn in their work. 
2.11.5.  Take Advantage of the Experienced. Seek out personnel who have been at the base or in the
area for a long time and ask for their help. Some will freely share their thoughts and others may ask a
lot of questions. They will usually have a wealth of information and invariably reveal overlooked, but
important, facts. 
2.11.6.  The Planning Leader’s Job. The planning leader guides plan development, assigns tasks, con-
solidates inputs, resolves conflicting requirements, and usually drafts the plan. The leader has an obli-
gation to improve and streamline the ef fort so the team does not waste time, individually or
collectively. Here are some thoughts on what the leader must do. 
2.11.6.1.  Learn all about the plan before meeting with the team. Get and read the reference mate-
rials. Have a copy of the plan to be updated. Know it thoroughly. Find out what the OPR wants—
in both details and format. 
2.11.6.2.  Outline the ob jectives for the effort. Put them on paper to expl ain them clearly to the
team. Ask a friend to review them; if they are not clear, rewrite them until they are. 
2.11.6.3.  Identify the required planning tasks and designate the person responsible for each task.
Specify the level of detail and format expected from them. Encourage team members to identify
any additional required tasks to make the plan more complete. 
2.11.6.4.  Set deadlines when the tasks are to  be complete. Make progress checks on the long
lead-time tasks. 
2.11.6.5.  Encourage imagination and ingenuity. If team members develop a good idea, give them
time and flexibility to verify the idea. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
57
2.11.7.  Minimum Alert Preparation Plan. One common assumption in war plans is that there will be
some period of warning before an  enemy attacks. During this peri od, the base would implement the
OPLAN and begin the preparations it calls for. Most planning also calls for a minimum alert prepara-
tion plan to cover the possibility that there would be very little advance notice. When planning, iden-
tify the most critical preattack preparation tasks and place them in priority order. Do this for tasks that
support the entire base and those for just the unit. Highlight those tasks in the plans. 
2.11.8.  Do Not Plan In A Vacuum. Civil engineers are just part of the base team. Good planning can
happen only when all base units contribute. This is the only way to identify support requirements and
develop agreements to provide or get that support. Be sure to coordinate unit plans with organizations
outside CE whenever the plans call for or modify support requirements. 
2.12.  Plan Updates. It is rarely necessary to totally rewrite a well-written plan, but do not assume prede-
cessors did a perfect job; they could have overlooked something important. Review plans on a regular
basis, usually once a year, and update them when necessary. Time-sensitive material requires the most fre-
quent updating. If such material has been properly filed by annex, appendix and tab, it is necessary only
to correct those individual items. When the new material requires coordination with other agencies, dis-
tribute a copy to each agency s imultaneously and use a coordination log to simplify follow-up actions.
Keep a record file of coordination sheets. 
2.13.  Sources of Information. Few indivi duals, if any, know everything needed to prepare contingency
response plans. Some useful documents and publications are listed here. Another good source is the expe-
riences of others. 
2.13.1.  MAJCOM Instructions and Planning Guidance. MAJCOMs prepare guidance that each base
in the command is expected to follow. There is no standard content or format for this guidance and is
often provided in OPLANs. A CE planner can spend a lot of time and energy trying to find out if there
is any special MAJCOM guidance. Start with the CE Readiness and Emer gency Management Flight
to see what information they have. Two other units on base may also have command guidance, the
Wing Plans and Logistics Plans office. Call MAJCOM CE Readiness and Emergency Management
personnel and ask for a list of current command guidance and instructions. If written guidance cannot
be found on base, ask the MAJCOM functional representatives to send copies. 
2.13.2.  War Plans/OPLANs with Associated Time-Phased Force and Deployment Lists/ Time-Phased
Force Deployment Data (TPFDL/TPFDD). Operations plans tell where and how forces will be pos-
tured to respond to a military threat. The TPFDLs  are a good source to find out what units and how
many personnel to beddown. These plans can be found in the Wing or Logistics Plans offices. These
documents are not the most use r friendly, hopefully this information is already included in the base
reception plan. 
2.13.3.  Base Comprehensive Plan. Component Plan O (Contingency Plan) of the comprehensive plan
contains information on land use th at can be helpful when  updating other base and unit plans. This
component plan should address issues such as wart ime disposal of toxic wastes, human wastes, and
solid refuse. This plan reflects the results of other contingency planning. 
2.13.4.  USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 1, Civil Engineer Supplement. The WMP,
HQ USAF, and MAJCOM planning documents provide mission requirements, direction, and guide-
lines for periods of national emergency or war. These documents also give general guidelines to aid in
disaster planning. The primary audience is MAJCOM planners, but the Civil Engineer Supplement
58
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
provides good background information for the base level planner. An airbase WMP can be found in
the Wing or Logistic Plans offices. The CE information is unclassified. 
2.13.5.  Identify applicable laws and regulations. Di fferent laws and regulations may apply based on
the location of the installation and whether the op eration is supporting a peacetime or wartime mis-
sion. 
2.13.5.1.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Within the CONUS, equip-
ment worn by Emergency Responders must be compliant with the Occupational Safety and Health
Act and DOD Instruction 2000.18. According to the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical
and Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) this applies to Emergency Responders, both on military
installations and in support of civil authorities.  Detailed guidance and standard exclusions are
available from the Department of Defense Chemical and Biological Defense Non-Standard Equip-
ment Review Panel. 
2.13.5.1.1.  Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). IPE is personal clothing and equipment
required to protect an individual from chemical , biological, and some nuclear effects in a
CBRN-warfare environment. The protective ma sk also protects the respiratory tract from
radioactive particles. IPE items may, but do not necessarily, meet the requirements of PPE for
emergency response where OSHA/NIOSH or AFOSHSTDs apply. 
2.13.5.1.2.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is equipment designed to protect indi-
viduals exposed to hazards from injury or illness in non-military unique occupational environ-
ments where OSHA/NIOSH or AFOSHSTDs ap ply, including emergency response to
CBRNE incidents in the United States. 
2.13.5.1.3.  Military Unique Operations. Military-unique operations are exempt from needing
OSHA/NIOSH and AFOSHSTDs approval; however, using this exemption within the
CONUS is very dangerous. Avoid pre-planning that includes actions that break laws. During
an emergency, the installation commander may do what is right and protect personnel the best
way possible, but pre-planning that places people in a situation without proper equipment and
training may lead to civil and/or criminal actions. 
2.13.5.2.  Peacetime vs. Wartime. Whether an event is an act of war or a crime is a complex deter-
mination, the implications of which will continue to challenge planning and execution for DOD in
the operational environment. Within the Homeland, military responders and support personnel
must be able to interact at an appropriate level with local, State, territorial, and tribal government
agencies responsible for protecting their citizens. In the interim,  personnel must be capable of
operating under the most restricted guidance provided by current Federal and State laws. 
2.13.6.  Additional Sources. Many more sources for contingency planning information are listed in
Attachment 1 of this publication, particularly the in structions, manuals, and pamphlets in the
10-series publications. 
2.14.  Summary. Preparing plans is an important step in getting civil engineers ready to respond to a crisis.
The process is more important than the product. Civil engineers contribute to most plans written at a base;
however, CE is the OPR for the CEMP 10-2. Good pl anning is a major effort and should involve more
personnel than just the Readiness Flight. Any one of the unit officers should be able to lead the prepara-
tion of the CE contingency response plan. This chapter provides guidelines for preparing that plan and
identifies other planning that ci vil engineers must accomplish. A qu ote by British General S ir John

Monash puts this chapter in perspective: “The main thing is always to have a plan; if it is not the best plan,
it is at least better than no plan at all.”

Chapter 3  
RESOURCES 
3.1.  Introduction. Plans give focus to contingency responses, yet are worthless unless the resources are
identified and available to carry plans out. Planning identifies the personnel, supplies, equipment, vehi-
cles, and resources required to c onduct disaster responses, base recovery, and other military operations.
There is one universal truth with regard to contingencies: you have to respond with the resources at hand.
Consequently, preplanning should place an emphasi s on acquiring required resources before a crisis
threatens. Planners should also know how to get additional assets if a crisis exceeds their assigned capa-
bilities. 
3.2.  Overview. This chapter is written from a civil engineer's perspect ive to help identify requirements
and obtain resources. It is not an authoritative document on personnel, supply, transportation, contracting
or other functions. Since those agencies will all execute some level of predisaster planning, contact them
if detailed information on their spec ialties is required. The purpose of  this chapter is to provide enough
information and plant enough ideas to work with those organizations successfully. 
3.3.  Personnel. Personnel are the most  important resource for all aspects of preplanning, recovery and
post disaster actions. CE squadrons are comprised of talented military, government civilians and contrac-
tors—the front line forces in a disaster and recovery response. It is imperative that planning considers risk
management factors and encourages safe practices. Further, planned exercises should actively assess risk
assessment processes and safety practices. The next several paragraphs will discuss broad groups of peo-
ple that can assist i n a response, but it is this core of people assign ed and ready-for-duty when disaster
strikes that are the most valuable in the early hours of response. We must ensure they are available when
needed by performing risk assessments to prevent careless injury with proper safety and risk management
planning. 
3.3.1.  In-Place Forces. Each Base Civil Engineer has a substantial recovery force already in-place in
the form of their squadron members ( Figure 3.1.). Without exception, every CE unit has many tal-
ented and dedicated individuals. These very same troops routinely perform mini-miracles when given
a little direction, support, and encouragement. Assigned base level CE Squadrons have the home field
advantage, because they are already on-scene, intimate with the infrastructure and utility details of the
base, and are already organized into a cohesive team. Th ey will also have a strong motivation to
recover their base, homes and communities. A crisis, especially war, dictates a different CE organiza-
tional personality than the one that exists during peace. The organization must switch from decentral-
ized low intensity facility maintenance to focused high intensity repairs. Rarely will the number and
mix of skills in the unit be ideal for the crisis at hand. However, a CE unit can improve its ability to
respond by freely loaning personnel from one work center to anothe r. A skilled craftsman can make
many repairs with the assistance of untrained, but willing helpers from other CE shops. But this works
only if individuals are more concerned with getting the job done a nd less concerned with having the
“right” specialties on the job.

3.3.1.1.  Military Personnel. At CONUS bases and a few overseas bases, most CE military person-
nel will be assigned to Prime BEEF teams. These individuals are subject to deploy on short notice.
Consequently, there can be no guarantee these troops will be available to respond to a local contin-
gency. A prudent BCE will assess the capabilities of the remaining military and civilian personnel
and then prepare plans to respond to disasters with these personnel. 
3.3.1.2.  Civilian Personnel. Civilians in the BCE work force constit ute a vital component of the
disaster response and base recovery force. Ci vilian and military positions absolutely required to
provide an initial contingency response force must be designated as “key” or "emergency essen-
tial." Emergency or mission essential employees are those who are employed at CONUS locations
and are vital to the mission at their current duty station or anot her CONUS base during a crisis
response. An emergency-essential employee is a DOD civilian employee whose assigned duties
and responsibilities must be ac complished following the evacuation of non-essential personnel
(including dependents) during a d eclared emergency or outbreak of war. The position occupied
cannot be converted to a military billet because it requires uninterrupted performance so as to pro-
vide immediate and continuing support for combat  operations and/or combat systems support
functions. The civilian personnel office will help in designating key or emergency-essential posi-
tions. The basic guidance for establishing key and emergency-essential positions is found in AFI
36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce. Don’t let anyone harbor the idea a civilian posi-
tion is not important if it is not coded key and essential. Disaster response may not be a condition
of employment for the civilians in those positions, but experience shows they too are “critical” and
many will make themselves available during and af ter a crisis without being specif ically called.
They are no less dedicated than the military workforce. There is one special wartime consideration
at airbases in foreign countries. For security reasons, the locally hired civilians may not be allowed
on base following an attack. Consequently, CE military personnel must be able to perform all base
recovery tasks—without the knowledge and skills of their local civilian coworkers. Additionally,
determine whether existing agreements exempt local national employees from mobilization into
their national armed forces. They too may "deploy." Before planning to use locally hired civilian
employees in an emergency, check with the civilian personnel office. Find out if there are any host
nation laws to consider. 
62
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
3.3.2.  Outside Help. Even with the best planning and preparations, disasters can occur that over-
whelm the capabilities of the CE organization. A fully manned and in-place CE force will not nor-
mally have enough personnel to perform all base  recovery tasks as fast as needed or to operate 24
hours-a-day. There are many ways t o augment the CE unit such as individual augmentees, Prime
BEEF teams, RED HORSE, Army and Navy engineer units, host nation engineers, and contracts. 
3.3.3.  Individual Augmentees. Augmentees are available from within CE, from other base organiza-
tions and from many off-base sources. Local augmentees have the advantage of being readily avail-
able. Off-base sources usually require longer times to marshal, and may ask for TDY cost
reimbursement. Keep in mind that most augmentees require training. The Readiness/Emergency Man-
agement and EOD functions have used augmentees for many years. 
3.3.3.1.  The Ideal Augmentee. The most useful augmentees usually come from within the organi-
zation. There is less hierarchy to go through to get them; they are easier to get for training; and
they are generally more familiar with the mission. USAFE and PACAF CE units often look within
the squadron first for EOD augmentees. 
3.3.3.2.  On-Base Augmentees. Define requirements for and request local military augmentees
from the base Augmentation Duty  program manpower pool whic h is administered by the local
military personnel flight. CE will compete with other base organizations for personnel, so develop
and request Augmentation Duty requirements early. Augmentees will require supervision, trans-
portation, tools, equipment, and training. Before requesting them, decide if their muscle power is
worth the extra efforts required; usually, it will be. See AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty and
the military personnel flight for additional information on this program. 
3.3.3.3.  Uniquely Qualified Individuals. Sometimes civilian employees and military personnel in
other base organizations may have especially useful skills. Do not hesitate to ask for their help. 
3.3.3.4.  Personnel from Other Bases. For local disasters, other bases may be able to provide assis-
tance. Decide what skills and numbers are needed, including supervisory personnel, then make the
request to the MAJCOM by phone and follow up with a message. The MAJCOM staff will deter-
mine the source of augmentation. Depending upon conditions, these troops can arrive within 2 or
3 days following the request. Feeding, housing and transportation are the unit’s responsibility; this
applies to both civilian employees and military personnel. 
3.3.3.5.  Reserve Components. Air National Gu ard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) unit assigned personnel (individuals, UTC packages and/or entire units) may also be used
for temporary manpower augmentation. Reserve component members are ordered to active duty
(voluntarily or involuntarily) under Secretary of the Air Forc e written authority through their
respective gaining MAJCOM. Funds for pay and allowances are provided from the USAF Mili-
tary Personnel Appropriation (MPA man-days for volunteers or direct allocations during involun-
tary call-up) and are apportioned to each gaining command. Travel and per diem are paid from the
using unit's (or MAJCOM’s) operations and maintenance (O&M) account. Man-days can be made
available to bring individuals and teams on bo ard quickly. This works best if the personnel
requested is known and are av ailable. Request these personnel by telephone (and message)
through the MAJCOM. 
3.3.3.6.  Civilian Over-hire. Hiring additional civilian personnel from the local economy is an
option for some installations. Normally, this can take 30 to 90 days, because position descriptions
must be written; the positions have to be classified and graded by the civilian personnel office, and
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
63
then the jobs recruited. However, the hiring process can be expe dited during an emergency, and
strong emphasis from the mission s upport group commander can help. The avai lability of local
craftsmen will be the unit’s biggest obstacle. The over hire approach only works well when the
local market has excess labor. Even then, the excess may or may not have the needed skills. Keep
in mind that the unit will ha ve to compete for this labor with the local contractors if the disaster
impacts the surrounding communities. Funds must be available to pay for these forces. The money
can come from the CE budget, from the base budget, or from the MAJCOM. 
3.3.3.7.  Mutual Aid Support. Do not overlook mutual aid agreements. While designed to provide
immediate short-term support, there may be possibilities to modify the agreement to arrange for
longer-term assistance. Be prepared to pay, however, for the additional help. 
3.3.3.8.  Military Retirees and the Standby Reserve. Active duty retirees may be ordered to active
duty if the Secretary of the Air Force determines their skills are critical to mission accomplishment
and not available from other military  categories. Retirees do not usually deploy overseas, but
replace active duty personnel who do. Standby Reserve personnel have completed all obligated or
required service or have been re moved from the Ready Reserve due  to circumstances of civilian
employment, temporary hardship, etc. These reservists maintain affiliation but are not assigned to
a unit, do not perform training, and are only available during full and total mobilization. 
3.3.3.9.  Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). One last source has limited application for
most bases. IMAs may be available for use dur ing war or the mobilization period preceding war.
IMAs are Selected Reserve memb ers not assigned to an organized Reserve unit. They are nor-
mally assigned to active duty organizations to fill individual manpower requirements during con-
tingency or wartime operations. Forward reque sts, with justification, for IMA manpower
requirements to the MAJCOM counterpart. Access to IMAs for contingency operations is similar
to the process used for ANG/AFRC unit personnel, discussed in paragraph 3.3.3.5. 
3.3.4.  Prime BEEF Teams. When a lot of outside help is needed in a hurry, the best choice is to have
the assistance of another Prime BEEF team. Assuming the MAJCOM supports the unit’s request, a
Prime BEEF team can be on-site within two days. While supervision is not needed, arrangements for
supplies, vehicle support, billeting, and messing will be required. If neces sary, a Prime BEEF team
can bring their own housekeeping or home station training sets so they have a place to sleep. This is
unusual, so make a special request for this action. Given a contingency that occurs with limited warn-
ing, Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard Prime BEEF teams may require a longer lead time than
acceptable for rapid on-scene support. However, if aware of such units in the local area that can and
are willing to help, include this information in the request to the MAJCOM. 
3.3.5.  RED HORSE. While RED HORSE support cannot be written into the plans, ask the MAJCOM
for their help. The big advantage with RED HORSE is that their squadron is essentially self-sufficient.
They have the talent, vehicles, and heavy equipment to do most major work (Figure 3.2.). While their
heavy equipment may take some time to get to the base, RED HORSE has proven they can move fast.
An advance team for the 823rd RED HORSE Squadron was in plac e at Keesler AFB less than 24
hours after Hurricane Katrina hit the base. The follow-on team arrived within the next two days.
Based on the track of the storm, they anticipated they might be needed and prepared to deploy even
before Katrina struck. 
64
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Figure 3.2.  RED HORSE Members Assist with Hurricane Recovery Efforts. 
3.3.6.  Army/Navy Engineers. Do not overlook the possibility of getting help from nearby Army and
Navy engineer units. Like RED HORSE, Army combat engineer units and Navy Seabees have the tal-
ent and heavy equipment for base recovery tasks. Contact these units to see if they are willing to help,
and then formally request their assistance through the MAJCOM. 
3.3.7.  Host Nation Engineers. A few overseas bases may be able to get support from host nation engi-
neer units. Find out what their capabilities are, who to contact, and what procedures are required to get
their support. If the crisis affects a large area, they may ask for support, since CE is likely to have more
capability than the host nation units. 
3.3.8.  Contractors. Local construction companies can provide excellent engineer support; however,
getting them on contract may be a challenge. Four conditions must exist to get timely contract support
for crisis response. First, contractors must be available; that will be  a problem if they ha ve suffered
substantially the same conditions that produced the problem on the installation. In addition, potential
contractors may already be committed to the local public or private sector. Therefore, unless the con-
tract is financially worth their effort, they will have no incentive to redirect their personnel and equip-
ment. Second, put in writing what the contractor is to accomplish; this does not always mean detailed
plans and specifications. Third, funds must be available. The contracting office must have money, or
a very good promise of it, to enter into a contract. Fourth, a good relationship and preplanning with the
contracting office to ensure they are ready to use the inherent flexibility within the procurement regu-
lations to provide crisis support is  crucial. Present the requirements to the contracting of fice and let
them decide how to meet the need. Identify pos sible sources, include names, addresses, and phone
numbers if known. When the crisis is over, be sure to acknowledge the good support received, if the
contracting office is used. 
3.3.8.1.  Use Requirements Contracts. Requirements contracts can sometimes be used to help with
emergencies. This type of contract is used in peacetime when the Air Force knows what goods and
services it desires, but does not know exactly how much it will need during a year. A unit price is
agreed upon for the contractor to perform a service or deliver goods. When there is a need for an
agreed service, the Air Force provides the mone y and informs the contractor how many units of
service is desired. These contracts are usually good for just one year and have a minimum number
of units the Air Force must ask for and a maximum number the contractor has to deliver. CE has
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
65
used requirements contracts to remove snow, clear debris, and paint buildings. Simplified Acqui-
sition Base Engineer Requirements (SABER) contracts are ideal for contingency support; almost
every kind of construction possible is within its scope. If such a contract exists, some basic provi-
sions may already include tasks needed to help with base recovery. There is no reason not to
include anticipated base recovery tasks. Ensure the contracting office, and the contractor, knows
the tasks are for emergencies. If possible, do not apply the minimums or maximums to those items,
but be fair. In an emergency affecting civilian areas as well AF property, the price of construction
materials tend to increase. Contractors may have to be allowed to recover material costs in such a
situation. The contractor cannot afford to subsidize the Air Force for factors beyond their control.
If the contractor is treated fair and a good relationship developed during normal times, there is a
reasonable chance the contractor will remain loyal to the AF dur ing a crisis. That relationship is
important, because there is practically nothing that can be done if the contractor was already obli-
gated and could not support the requirement. Be sure to include a list of these contracts in the CE
contingency response plan. 
3.3.8.2.  Develop Emergency Contracts. Attempt to secure an emergency contract to cover a situ-
ation when no other contract is available. These types of contracts will always occur faster and be
better when there is a strong relationship betw een the engineers and the contracting office. That
relationship is developed from consistent peacetime cooperation and earned trust; command
emphasis also helps. Do not overlook any avenue to satisfy mission requirements. Be aware of the
level of contract effort taking place on the ba se and understand what waivers are required to
accomplish diversion; it may invo lve adding a contingency clause. If unable to find a solution
working with the base-level contracting office, seek advice from the MAJCOM. 
3.3.9.  CONUS Sustaining Backfill Requirements. Wh en Prime BEEF mobility personnel deploy in
support of major contingency operations, the losing BCE must: 
3.3.9.1.  Quantify the expected voids in the work force and indicate which voids contract support
can fill and which will require active or reserve military backfill. 
3.3.9.2.  Identify and prioritize all mission-essential tasks that backfill forces must perform (e.g.,
sewage, water, power, and heat plant operations; emergency service call operations; readiness/
emergency management, EOD, FES, etc). 
3.3.9.3.  Identify all missio n-essential tasks that require special licenses and certifications (e.g.,
water plant operations, industrial waste plant operations, FES, etc.). 
3.3.9.4.  Address the use of the base’s non-deployed active duty personnel and critical essential
civilian members to support the installation’s mission. 
3.3.9.5.  List minimum training augmenting forces will require to become familiar with the base's
equipment and operations. 
3.4.  Supplies and Equipment. Traditionally, CE turns to base supply or the ba se contracting office—
before and after disasters—for supplies and equipment. This section presents ideas on how to obtain the
supplies and equipment needed. 
3.4.1.  Situation. The rules for getting supplies and equipment have become less rigid over the years.
The Air Force is moving away from mandatory worldwide procedures and giving commanders more
latitude and authority. Users, base supply, and the contracting office have far more flexibility to set up
local procedures to handle local needs. Many Air Force instructions and manuals still apply, but they
66
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
present guidelines for smart individuals rather than inflexible procedures. This does not mean that
roadblocks are nonexistent. Look for the experts in each organization that understand how the supply
system works. It also helps to become familiar with AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. 
3.4.2.  Funding. Increased flexibility and local control discussed in  the previous paragraph requires
additional local funding. Less centralized funding of supplies and equipment requires users to fund for
more of the materials needed. This puts an added challenge on installations when preparing for contin-
gencies. Engineers must divert funds from their budgets to build reasonable stockpiles of supplies and
equipment required to respond to disasters. Due to limited funds, it may take engineers a few years to
build the needed stockpiles. Ai r Force budgets do not reserve funds for peacetime emergencies or
disaster relief operations. Air Force commanders must use available funds as they see fit to protect life
and property. Recurring conditions present a different situation. Civil engineers can and should budget
each year for supplies and equipmen t for snow removal and other r ecurring events that can become
crises. 
3.4.3.  Determining Requirements. In addition to receiving assistance from the MAJCOM, the follow-
ing approach may help when developing requirements. 
3.4.3.1.  Timing. The best time to determine requirements is  while preparing or updating plans.
Identify materials and equipment to support the plans. Use a planning group to scrub the require-
ments and be careful not to overstate them; each recommendation should be justified. 
3.4.3.2.  Planning Factors. Determine equipment and material quantities by using planning factors.
Requirements vary by base, the severity of the di saster, the solution one chooses to solve a prob-
lem, and many other variables. Some  planning factors and requirements are relatively easy to
develop; the number of sandbags in a berm is a good example, wh ich follows. The standard bag
size of 4"x8"x16" yields a volu me of 0.3 cubic foot per bag. De termine the dimensions of the
sandbag structure, calculate the volume of soil needed (in cubic feet), and divide by 0.3 to deter-
mine the number of sandbags required. 
3.4.3.2.1.  Most material planning factors and requirements for base recovery are very difficult
to determine. In those cases, make an educated guess. If available, borrow planning factors
from other bases exposed to the same crises . Unit personnel are in the best position to make
the assumptions and to use g ood engineering judgment to develop the planning factors and
requirements. Document any planning factors used in the contingency response plan or in a
permanent, not-to-be-retired-or-destroyed file in the Readiness and Emer gency Management
Office. 
3.4.3.2.2.  The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight officer should review the plan-
ning factors at least once during their assignment to make sure they are still valid. This should
be a common-sense look versus a detailed technical review. 
3.4.3.3.  Reality Check. After dete rmining the necessary amount of  requirements, look at the
results to verify if the numbers look reasonable and if there is balance in the requirements; if not,
adjust the numbers. Unrealistic numbers are possible if the calculations are blindly relied upon.
There are no criteria to perform this assessment; the reality check is an intuitive, common sense
assessment. 
3.4.3.4.  Availability Check. Once requirements are known, determine the quantity already
on-hand or normally available. Also, ascertain what and how much is re adily available through
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
67
local sources. The difference between the sum of these numbers and the total requirements will be
the deficit and must be ordered for contingency stockpiles. 
3.4.3.5.  Common Items for Disaster Response. Table 3.1. lists supplies commonly needed in
emergencies; however, there may be many other needed items, but this list should stimulate think-
ing. Do not forget common shop equipment the unit uses every day, especially radios and batter-
ies, and specialized firefighting, readiness/emergency management, and explosive ordnance
disposal equipment. 
3.4.3.6.  Minimum Stocks Required. Contact the MAJCOM for required peacetime and wartime
stock levels. Some examples of items which may have minimum levels include: 
3.4.3.6.1.  Firefighting Agents. AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Preven-
tion Program, details the peacetim e minimum stock levels of firefighting agents equal to the
total capacity of assigned firefighting vehicles at the fire station. Check with the MAJCOM for
any guidance on required wartime stock levels for firefighting agents. 
3.4.3.6.2.  Demolition Explosives. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) flights are required to
maintain demolition explosives according to AFI 32-3001. The type and quantity of explo-
sives are listed in the EOD Equ ipment and Supplies Listing (ESL) for Prime BEEF mobility
teams and AFCAT 21-209, Munitions Allowances for Individual Training and Training Units
for training munitions. Check to see if there are MAJCOM directives pertaining to demolition
explosives. Demolition explosives listed in the ESL are configured and maintained in readily
deployable condition for either air or over the road movement. 
3.4.3.6.3.  Heating Fuels. While no longer dictated by Air Force publications, MAJCOMs may
specify minimum levels for solid, liquid, and gas heating fuels. 
3.4.4.  Classes of Supply. The supply system categorizes materiel in ten classes. Those classes are
listed in the USAF WMP, Volume 1 and are shown in Table 3.2.

etc.) are determined at each base.  Some items may appear in more than 1 column.  Either or both
areas can be used.  The first column is suitable for high value, critical items, and items with shelf-life
codes.  
2. Columns 2 and 3 may duplicate shop bench stock, but held in reserve for emergencies.  
3. The third column constitutes the only distinct effort to warehouse supplies and equipment for base
contingency response separate from day-to-day operations for the BCE.  To minimize cost and ware-
housing requirements, keep shelf-life items to a minimum.  A complete list of these items should be
included in the CE Contingency Response Plan.

3.4.5.5.  PWRMS outside the CONUS (requires transportation to move). 
3.4.5.6.  Stocks on prepositioned ships.

3.4.5.9.  CONUS stocks dedicated to a theater of operations. 
3.4.5.10.  Wholesale CONUS stocks. 
3.4.5.11.  Stock from CONUS commercial production. 
3.4.5.12.  Excess stock from another theater. 
3.4.6.  On-Base Stock and Stockpiles. This paragraph outlines the s ources most often used by base
engineers. The first place one turns to get supplies and equipment is obviously from the stock already
on-base. Experience has shown that the supplies and equipment available for day-to-day operations
are often adequate for many peacetime contingencies or disaster situations. 
3.4.6.1.  Base Supply Stock. Some of the items needed in an emergency may be available on the
shelves in base supply warehouses. To be responsive to customer needs, base supply attempts to
keep a backup stock of high use items. Supply uses its computer to track demands on each item
they handle and to develop a historic demand level. Base supply uses stock funds to buy high use
items that users have not yet called for. Base supply reorders items based on the demand level. In

other words, supply will often order high demand items in bulk. Items with a low consumption
rate are ordered infrequently, and it is possible none will be on  the shelves. High demand items
will be more readily available, because a pipeline for them has been established. The user pays for
these items when issued. 
3.4.6.2.  Bench Stock. The CE bench stock is set up to support the day-to-day facility operation
and maintenance activities of the CE organization. However, bench stock can be a ready source of
supplies for the CE DRF. Bench stock puts high us e, expendable items near the user rathe r than
keeping them in the base suppl y warehouses. This convenience makes bench stock the first stop
for supplies—after shop stock, of course. They are go od sources for materials in an emergency,
because they include the items most commonly used every day by CE. There are many items in
bench stock, but quantities of each item are limited and can only support small disasters. 
3.4.6.2.1.  A key feature with bench stock is that the user controls them. The using organiza-
tion decides what items are added and deleted and sets the authorized level for each item. This
is only fair since the user pays for the bench stock items at the time of issue from base supply
even though the items are not used until a later date. Bench stock is built around shop foremen
recommendations. 
3.4.6.2.2.  Pure contingency response items can also be added, but keep two points in mind: 1)
whatever is added must be paid for immediately; 2) low usage items have a way of being mis-
placed, usually out of neglect but sometimes from theft, and may not be available when
needed. 
3.4.6.2.3.  Setting up a bench stock requires continuous management. Base supply does not
automatically refill bench stock; to get replenishment, a refill demand has to be placed on base
supply. A bench stock item is no rmally reordered when the number of items in a bin is less
than 50 percent of the authorized level. The perc entage is arbitrary and set by the user. It can
be lower or higher and does not have to be the same for all items. This process allows the orga-
nization to control the amount of money it spends on bench stock. 
3.4.6.2.4.  When bench stock items have not been reordered for long periods, the base supply
computer will highlight the item as a candidate for deletion from bench stock. This is the ideal
time for the organization to reassess that contingency item to make sure it is still required. New
technologies make some items obsolete, but do not arbitrarily eliminate a serviceable item just
because there is a new technology. The shop foremen should be i nvolved in identifying
requirements for contingencies so they will understand why each item is included in the bench
stock during the periodic bench stock reviews. This logic applies to all contingency items and
sources. 
3.4.6.2.5.  A practical way to enha nce bench stock support for emergencies is to increase the
authorized levels for items the planning team anticipates the unit will need most during contin-
gencies. If an authorized level based on normal consumption is adequate to cover contingency
requirements, no adjustments are necessary. Increasing the stock levels over 2 to 3 years may
be necessary to control costs. Bench stock is not an efficient method for providing low
demand, high value, or bulk items. 
3.4.6.3.  Self-Help Store. This source is separate from base supply stocks and CE bench stock at
many bases but remains a generally healthy source of common facility maintenance parts. Be cau-

tious about accounting as some self help stores stock a mix of housing- purchased and Facility
Operations purchased items driving a potential need to account and reimburse. 
3.4.6.4.  Special Levels. Special levels may be established in base s upply to ensure critical items
are on hand in the required quanti ties to support base contingencies. The demand for such items
usually does not warrant addition to bench stock, but are mission essential and must be readily
available. The user identifies the minimum quantity to be kept on hand, but do not expect supply
to stock more than that number. Special levels are very important at overseas bases, especially in
countries where supplies and equipment are not readily available from local suppliers. Be sure to
list special level items that support continge ncies in the CEMP 10-2. Doing so provides the
authority and justification for base supply to maintain thos e special level items. Special level
requests are submitted on AF Form 1996. 
3.4.6.4.1.  Special levels are attractive, because the user does not pay for those items until they
are issued from base supply. This arrangement ties up base supply’s limited stock fund, so
focus on getting special levels for the most mission critical items and those with the longe st
lead times. Naturally, it is desirable to get the more expensive items covered as well. Attempt
to get all necessary items on special level, but be prepared to compromise, listen, and work
within the supply system. 
3.4.6.4.2.  Base supply usually stores and keeps track of special le vel item(s), but special
arrangements can be made to store selected items in the CE area. This gives CE physical con-
trol, but CE will also ha ve to find the room to store the items, and keep track of them. This
reduces the chance that base supply will misplace the item or classify it as excess. However,
CE runs this same risk if the items are not clearly marked and routinely inventoried. 
3.4.6.4.3.  The chief of s upply has the option to establish c ontracts for special level items,
either blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) or requirements contracts. As BPAs involve no
expenditure of funds until exercised, this type of contract is most often favored by base supply.
From the BCE perspective, this means that the item is not physically “on the shelf” in base
supply, but must be purchased when the demand is made; a lead time delay may be involved. 
3.4.6.5.  Seasonal Items. Some items have a higher  demand at different times of the year. Con-
sumption is so irregular on these items that the demand level does not provide satisfactory support.
Work with base supply to ensure  adequate stock of seasonal items  is on hand at the right times.
This approach can help units better prepare for cyclic conditions that can turn into an emergency,
such as an exceptionally heavy blizzard. Order these items early and keep track of their delivery
status. The unit may have to negotiate as to which items base supply will hold in their warehouses
and which CE must pay for up front. Some seasonal items are purchased by the user as bulk deliv-
ery items. 
3.4.6.6.  Bulk Delivery Items. Some items are logically ordered in bulk; sand, gravel, salt, rock,
urea, bark-mulch, crushed sea shells, water and sewage treatment plant chemic als (including
industrial water treatment) and oi l absorbent are a few examples ( Figure 3.3.). They often find
extra applications during emergency situations. Most bulk items are ordered by sending a pur-
chase request from the user to the contracting office. Base supply is not usually involved, because
bulk items are difficult to manage. For example, it is ha rd to count the cubi c yards in a pile of
gravel and know if two yards ar e missing. Operating level for ea ch item should be periodically
reviewed, and quantities should be adjusted when warranted. 
72

Figure 3.3.  Stockpile Storage Yard. 
3.4.6.7.  Residual Holding Area. This  BCE holding area contains resi due from work orders, and
may contain useful items in an emergency. Do not count on any specific item being there when a
disaster hits; inventories often change. Items ma y be identified and marked for disaster support.
The unit has already paid for these items and requires no additional funds. 
3.4.6.7.1.  Occasionally, walk through the holding area to make sure the contingency support
items are still there. The BCE must keep track of what supplies and equipment are in the hold-
ing area. In addition, k eep track of items by looking at the periodically updated inventory
sheet. The shop foremen should definitely know what is in the holding area inventory. 
3.4.6.7.2.  There is a good chance that mechanical and electrical equipment stored in the hold-
ing area and exposed to the elements will not work if stored for a long time. It is a good idea to
store these type items in an indoor holding area, and if important, have the shops periodically
inspect and service them. 
3.4.6.8.  CE Contingency Stock. CE can always buy critical supplies and equipment. These items
may be stored in the shops, in th e residual holding area, or at any location selected by the BCE.
The best way to justify buying and storing these items is to list them in the IGESP or the CE Con-
tingency Response Plan. Inventory these stocks periodically to ensure they are still available. Do
not count on backup stock in base supply unless the unit routinely orders these items. 
3.4.7.  Contractor Operated Civil Engineer Supply Store (COCESS). The supply system is often not
responsive to CE needs because of all the non-standard parts engineers deal with, unlike the aircraft
on base which the supply system can support well. Civil Engineers have tried many ways to improve
supply support and one of most successful is COCESS. For most CE units, COCESS is the key to get-
ting needed supplies and equipmen t quickly. This is true for both routine and disaster support. Of
course, CE still has access to base supply, but they generally try to follow one basic rule in this case:
only one source of supply for an item. Base suppl y does not want to handle items available through
COCESS. This keeps base supply from having to tie up their stock funds to put backup items on their
shelves which have low demand le vels. Conversely, COCESS should not stock items that are also
used by other organizations on base. Those items belong in base supply. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
73
3.4.7.1.  COCESS is essentially a requirements contract. The CE unit lists the types of supplies
and equipment and approximately how much of each item it will need in a year. CE also provides
a facility for the contractor. The COCESS contractor sets up a bench stock operation and gets
materials for work orders. The prices for most of the items are set by the contract. There are pro-
visions to get unanticipated materials as well. 
3.4.7.2.  Under COCESS, special levels can be set up. The BCE can either require the contractor
to stock selected items (usually done at a premium price) or ask the contractor to pre-identify
sources of supply that can satisfy emergency requirements within acceptable time limits. 
3.4.8.  Local Vendors. Each CE unit should be aware of the civilian suppliers in the area that possess
the types of inventories useful to the unit. Even with COCESS, this backup is needed should the
COCESS contractor fail to meet the unit’s needs. In fact, identify and list these vendors in the CE con-
tingency response plan as a source of materials following an emergency. Primary concerns when deal-
ing with off-base civilian suppliers are transportation and payment requirements. 
3.4.8.1.  For the supplies to be useful , they must be transported to  the work area. If CE does not
have vehicles available to pick-up the needed supplies, ask the vendor if they can deliver. This can
be a problem during emergencies. The vendor may not have enough trucks to transport the sup-
plies, or the roads leading to the base from the vendor location may be impassable. It is generally
not advisable to depend on the vendor to deliver supplies under emergency conditions. Base sup-
ply or transportation may be able to help. 
3.4.8.2.  Suppliers are normally paid by government chec k after receiving the bill and being
assured by the receiving unit that the goods have been delivered in serviceable condition. During
emergencies, a civilian supplier, especially in overseas areas, may be reluctant to accept the gov-
ernment’s promise or check in payment for goods received. In that case, provisions will have to be
made for a cash payment. 
3.4.8.3.  Other factors that might limit or eliminate the use of civilian suppliers are: 
3.4.8.3.1.  Civilian resources ma y be damaged or de stroyed from the same disaster which
impacted the base. 
3.4.8.3.2.  The civilian vendor may have previous commit ments to furnish supplies to the
civilian community. 
3.4.8.3.3.  The civilian ven dor may take an opportunistic ap proach at the time of the emer-
gency and sell goods only to the highest bidder. 
3.4.8.3.4.  If the emergency involves a hostile action, the civilian supplier in the overseas area
may change alliances at this critical time and refuse to sell goods to the US. 
3.4.8.3.5.  In some overseas theaters, civilian suppliers of the military may become targets of
terrorists and other covert action groups. 
3.4.8.3.6.  Overseas suppliers may also fall in the category where their inventories are essen-
tially nationalized by their national military forces. 
3.4.9.  GOCESS. In some insta nces, government operated civil engineer supply store (GOCESS) is
used in lieu of COCESS. While there are some procedural differences, the two operations look the
same to the user. 
74
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
3.4.10.  CE Mobility Equipment. If the unit is short of hand tools and equipment following a disaster,
do not forget about the Prime BEEF team kits. There is no better reason to use them than a crisis. Let
the MAJCOM know that the unit is no longer ready to deploy immediately if the Prime BEEF kits are
used. Details of Prime BEEF team kits are contained in the Prime BEEF Equipment and Supplies List-
ing. 
3.4.11.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM assets, managed according to the policies contained in
AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures, once were essentially
untouchable during peacetime; this has changed. MA JCOMs set the policy for the assets under their
control. With some restrictions, WRM may be used  in peacetime for disaster relief, mercy missions,
and humanitarian purposes (flood, earthquake, major accidents, etc.). Generally, the wing commander
of the storing base can author ize the peacetime use of WRM w ithout advance approval from HQ
USAF or other approval authorities when such eq uipment is required for an imminent emer gency of
political or humanitarian significance. When this authority is exercised, HQ USAF or other approval
authority must be notified promptly. If these assets are not on base, but needed, ask the MAJCOM to
provide them quickly. 
3.4.11.1.  Prepositioned Assets. Most WRM assets are prepositioned to place the asset as close as
practicable to its point of use. Prepositioning depends on such variables and constraints as warning
time, unit readiness, security of the area, terminal facilities, storage capacity, maintenance, distri-
bution capability, and survivability. Some WRM assets are dispersed to enhance their survivabil-
ity. In the event of total mobilization, airlift capability would be a limiting factor. Therefore,
certain prepositioning actions have already been accomplished that will help civil engineer forces
(and others) accomplish their wartime mission. For instance, both USAFE and PACAF have Base
Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) housekeeping packages in storage. RED HORSE and
ADR heavy equipment are also stored at several locations in Europe. In addition, USCENTAF has
great quantities of BEAR equipment and vehicle fleets stored in Southwest Asia in order to sup-
port rapid deployment forces to that part of the world. These housekeeping and heavy equipment
packages have their own UTCs and are pushed to their employment locations based on OPLANs.
Bases that are to receive these packages should write operating instructions for setting up the
assets and include them in the CE contingency response plan. 
3.4.11.2.  ADR Equipment Sets. Prepositioning ADR sets has increased the crater repair capability
at selected overseas main operating bases (MOB). These sets are generally located at bases vulner-
able to attack, and may be deploy ed to other sites if needed ( Figure 3.4.). Prepositioning crater
repair and spall repair materials and equipment has enhanced Air Force civil engineers’ ability to
support the wartime flying miss ion. The MAJCOM evaluates specific regional threats to deter-
mine ADR set requirements and appr opriate levels of WRM, such as crushed stone, fiberglass
mats, precast concrete slabs, and spall repair materials for each base. ADR vehicle sets are
described in UFC 3-270-07, Airfield Damage Repair. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
75
Figure 3.4.  Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) Equipment. 
3.4.11.2.1.  ADR war reserve materiel assets must be kept serviceable at all times as directed
by AFI 25-101. Several organizations (supply, civil engineer, and transportation) store and
maintain portions of the ADR set. Special stock levels should be es tablished as required by
each MAJCOM to keep the ADR equipment serviced and in-commission at the base. 
3.4.11.2.2.  The WRM mobility secti on of base supply and the us er must periodically inven-
tory and inspect WRM equipment and materials. While in stor age, inspections are made to
ensure the items are present and serviceable. After use and before being returned to stock,
tools and components should be inventoried and serviced. 
3.4.11.3.  Other WRM (O-WRM). Some bases are authorized to keep a special stock of supplies
and equipment called Other WRM. These items do not usually directly support aircraft operations
but are important to sustain wartime operations. In effect, these stocks are special levels, but paid
for by WRM funds supplied by the MAJCOM. 
3.4.12.  Home Station Training Sets. Items in the home station traini ng sets can be used to support
emergencies. The allowance for these sets is c ontained in AS 429. They are authorized at CONUS
units with a mobility tasking and are not WRM assets. 
3.4.13.  Military Supply Points. Military supply points are established to bring supply support closer
to the user. They may be used to support Air Force activities at any contingency location where there
is no base supply function. In effect, the supply point becomes a base supply to the users in those sit-
uations. Military supply points are also used overseas to support large or specialized supply items that
are normally available only from a depot located thousands of miles away and requiring weeks, or
even months, to reach the requesting unit. For example, the 38 CTS at Ramstein AB, Germany serves
as a military supply point for gener ators and aircraft arresting systems for USAFE units. The MAJ-
COM can inform the unit if such supply points exist for CE items. 
3.4.14.  Resupply. A few words are needed about resupply for overseas bases during wartime or major
contingencies. During major crises, military supply sources may be unable to support resupply
76
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
requests from all units. Main base supply or ganizations will rapidly exhaust their resources. Quick
resupply from depots or CONUS locations is doubtful due to limited airlift availability, especially in
the early stages of a conflict. During that period, aircraft will be fully involved in moving military
forces and their equipment into th e theater of operations. Resupply by air is even less likely for the
bulky construction materials needed by civil engineers. For these reasons, planning guidance empha-
sizes that overseas units should be capable of operating for 30-60 days without resupply during war-
time. This gives time for the military to establ ish the land and sea resupply pipeline. MAJCOMs set
the prepositioning objectives, but they do change, so follow MAJCOM guidance. 
3.4.14.1.  Traditionally, Class IV materials are “pushed” to a theater of operation during the early
stages of a conflict. The items are sent based on requirements outlined by the theater unified/joint
command in its CESP, which is part of the command’s OPLAN. MAJCOM requirements are con-
solidated with the other US milita ry services in theater. The requirements may not cover every
possible item needed. They provide for a variety of items within a supply class. The user then has
to make do with what arrives. Eventually, with the supply pipeline operating, the resupply opera-
tion begins to accommodate “pulle d” items. Those items are s hipped based on specific user
requests. Unless moved by air, the Air Force depends on other services to move goods from the
CONUS to the theater ports and then to airbases; by itself this is not a problem. However, the unit
may or may not get what is needed. Items have a way of being diverted or stolen at the ports and
at other intermediate destinations. Other units with the same re quirements also compete for sup-
plies. Whenever authorized, order materials against aircraft sup port priorities. Working with the
MAJCOM, understand what Class IV supplies are available through the joint command and what
must be done to get them. Also, find out if there are agreements for resupply from local sources.
Good HNS will reduce prepositioning requirements. 
3.4.14.2.  The need for supplies a nd equipment can vary greatly depending on mission, location,
extent of damage, etc. In future conflicts, expe ct more flexible resupply procedures to be used.
This was accomplished during Operations DESERT SHIELD/STORM. A military supply point
was set up at Langley AFB to handle Air Force requirements. The supply point had the capability
to order and track material just as a base supply operation could. This unit also coordinated airlift
requirements and set movement priorities. The use of computers and satellite communications
allowed for very rapid ordering of supplies and equipment. Requests were often processed from
the units in the AOR to vendors within a matter of hours. To speed delivery to the units, items were
often shipped from the supplier directly to the final destination (e.g. by Federal Express) rather
than by truck from the supplier to a CONUS aerial port to await transshipment by military or con-
tract aircraft. 
3.4.14.3.  Even with new t echnologies and procedures, engineers must still face the reality that
bulky construction materials will not get high priorities for movement from the CONUS. While
they may eventually be shipped by sea, civil engineers must develop local sources of resupply. 
3.4.15.  Informal Sources. There are some informal sources of supply when little else is working. The
supply sources that a civil engineer unit normally uses will be limited or nonexistent during times of
disaster. Since it is during these ti mes of limited resources that the services of the civil engineer unit
are most important, no source of  resupply should be overlooked. An  effective salvage operation can
complement the resupply network. Facilities damaged beyond repair  during the emergency should
always be considered sources of equipment and materials for base recovery. Another option is to can-
nibalize undamaged lower priority facilities to get materials to support hi gh priority facilities. As a
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
77
last resort, borrow, scrounge, or barter from nearby units of any service. Although many items will not
be available through these methods, the innovative use of the resources that can be recovered or
obtained will reduce the demands on the supply system at this critical time and will hasten the recov-
ery effort. 
3.4.16.  Protect Supplies and Equipment. Protect materials after receiving them. There are many ways
to lose supplies; here are a few to consider: 
3.4.16.1.  While not wanting to dwell on it, the greater the shortage, the more materials are at risk
from pilfering. 
3.4.16.2.  Materials can also be lost due to war damage or natural disaster. Consider protecting the
most critical materials by dispersing them or putting them in prot ected areas such as revetments.
Unfortunately, dispersing puts material at greater risk of pilferage. 
3.4.16.3.  The biggest challenge to ke ep materials intact is the routine use of contingency stock-
piles. There is a tendency to raid  those stockpiles when a unit runs short of an item in its regular
stock. There is nothing wrong with  either practice as long as su pplies are quickly replaced. Too
often that is not accomplished, us ually due to a shortage of funds . Even when no disaster threat-
ens, materials have a way of vanishing without any record. Periodic availability checks and inven-
tories help expose these problems. 
3.4.16.4.  Weather-sensitive products should be monitored closely (like urea). Open storage of salt
and urea should be avoided. The greatest chance for contamination of ground water is at the stor-
age site. The weather may degrade the product, re ndering it useless. Runoff from stockpiles may
clog storm drains, so monitor drainage systems carefully. 
3.4.16.5.  Rotate stock with a shelf life. The CE logistics section should have procedures to make
sure shelf-life materials do not go bad, but they need the cooperation of the shop foremen. 
3.4.17.  Cost Accounting. Certain expenditures during contingency operations are reimbursable. This
places great importance on accurate and timely recording of expenditures. However, the initial
response phase of a contingency operation is not the time to worry about reimbursements; take care of
the situation first. The CE cont ingency response plan should contain an operating instruction for
maintenance engineering to open a work order and to notify financial management to track costs. 
3.4.18.  Emergency Requisition. Rather than cite the public laws or Federal Acquisition Regulations
which change, it is sufficient for civil engineers to know that both base supply and the base contract-
ing office have provisions for getting supplies and equipment expeditiously under emergency condi-
tions. Check with them in advance to find out what must occur for them to use those provisions. 
3.5.  Vehicles. Obviously, vehicles are needed to move personnel, supplies, and equipment. Special equip-
ment is also needed to perform heavy construction and base recovery tasks. The CE fleet includes both
general and special purpose vehicles which are often adequate for most situations encountered during
contingencies. The best way to ensure vehicles ar e available for a contingenc y is to have an active
day-to-day vehicle management program and good maintenance support. That program is outlined in AFI
24-301, Vehicle Operations. State all vehicle requirements in the CE Contingency Response Plan or
IGESP whether the unit currently has them or not. Sometimes units only copy their vehicle authorization
list and fail to include special purpose vehicles they need for a recovery effort. 
78
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
3.5.1.  General Purpose (GP) Vehicles. GP vehicles form the backbone of the fleet. Allowance Stan-
dard 019 lists vehicles allowed for normal operations. The unit should review the Allowance Standard
to confirm its allowance and then submit a request  to the transportation squadron stating the unit’ s
requirement with justification. The base must assign priorities to all requests. When the wing Logis-
tics Group commander approves the request, it is then sent to MAJCOM where it competes for com-
mand priority with requirements from the other bases in the co mmand. The MAJCOM gets funding
targets from the Air Staff. The command will r ecommend buys from its prio rity list until reaching
each fiscal year funding target. MAJCOM requirements are sent to the Air Staff and consolidated for
fiscal year buy programs by Warner-Robbins Air Logistics Center. This process often requires annual
updates and revalidation, because there is very limited funding fo r replacing vehicles. Acquiring a
new vehicle can easily take three to four years—or longer. 
3.5.1.1.  Occasionally, the unit may get a temporary loan from the transportation squadron to
replace a vehicle that is deadlined for maintenance or parts. Usually, the unit must accommodate
the need within its fleet or temporarily rent a vehicle. 
3.5.1.2.  Civil engineers (and other support units) have one recurring problem with GP vehicles.
These vehicles are subject to recall and redistribution to other ba se units with a higher priority,
especially during contingencies when CE also needs them most. There has not been many ef fec-
tive ways to counter this problem. Let the commanders know the impact on the unit’s capabilities
when this happens. Work with the transportation squadron and the logistics group commander to
ensure unit vehicles are listed with appropriat e priorities for the vari ous contingencies. Know
which of the unit vehicles are subject to being pulled away to support others and do not count on
them being available. The commander’s weekly update briefing (if applicable) is a good forum to
highlight overall vehicle status and specific problems. 
3.5.2.  Special Purpose Vehicles. Experience shows that this category of vehicles is most often criti-
cally short during contingency operations (Figure 3.5.). Depending on the installation’s mission,
other base agencies may be authorized vehicles similar or identical to those in the CE fleet. If this is
the case, a listing of such specia lized equipment, by type or cap acity and by organization (including
Army Air Force Exchange Service,  non-appropriated funds, etc.) should be maintained in the CE
CRP. 
Figure 3.5.  Special Purpose Contingency Vehicles. 
3.5.2.1.  The unit receives special purpose vehicles in the same manner as that of general-purpose
vehicles. However, special purpose vehicles tend to be expensive and compete for the same pot of
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
79
money as general-purpose vehicles. The temptation is very strong for the command to recommend
buying ten pickups for daily use rather than one excavator. There are no good solutions except to
be thorough when preparing the request; make the justification strong, but realistic. Line up MAJ-
COM support in advance by le tting the MAJCOM CE staff know what the unit needs and why .
They can, and should, support those needs. Occasionally, the MAJCOM or Air Staff will provide
vehicles in a downward directed program. Many ADR and firefighting vehicles were purchased
that way. To obtain a vehicle not listed in an allowance standard requires a powerful justification
and usually needs to show cost savings. Based on experience, the special purpose vehicles listed in
Table 3.3. are critical assets during contingencies. 
Table 3.3.  Special Purpose Vehicles Important for Contingency Operations. 
3.5.3.  Firefighting Vehicles. Firefighting vehicles (Figure 3.6.) are authorized based on aircraft
assigned, or supported, and as specified in AS 019. MAJCOM Fire and Emergency Services identify
special requirements. The total number of personnel authorized in each fire department is based on the
number of firefighters required to manage various emergency events. When contingency circum-
stances dictate the use of alternate water sources or refueling points, include this data in the CE CRP
for quick reference.

3.5.4.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Vehicles. Both general and sp ecial purpose EOD vehicles are
authorized based upon the mission and MAJCOM unique requirements, and as allowed in AS(s) 012,
156, and 456. Special purpose vehicles include the armored vehicles listed in Table 3.3. The vehicles
listed in AS 156 are prepositioned at overseas locations, at CONUS bases supporting bombing and
gunnery ranges, and the Silver Flag Exercise site only. 
3.5.5.  Readiness and Emergency Management Vehicles. The mobile emergency operations center
(MEOC) is an alert vehicle assigned to the CE Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. It pro-
vides the incident commander w ith command, control, and commu nications support for disaster
response operations. It is typically equipped with communications e quipment (radios, cellular tele-
phone, fax machine, public address systems), sirens, maps/charts, and other disaster response equip-
ment. 
3.5.6.  Rental Vehicles. The unit may be able to satisfy shortfalls by renting vehicles and heavy equip-
ment. Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM revealed that this is true for bare  bases as well as for
main bases. However, this method of obtaining vehicles and equipment is highly dependent upon the
beddown locations. Less developed nations cannot supply many types of special purpose vehicles as
was experienced in Operations ENDURING and IRAQI FREEDOM. 
3.5.6.1.  Shortfalls may exist on a main base when vehicles are damaged, when out-of-commission
for parts or maintenance, or when there are simply not enough assets. A list of off-base sources for
general and special purpose vehicles should be compiled by the base and maintained in the CE
CRP. Where renting is contemplated, blanket purchase agreements (BPA) will prove sufficient at
most main bases. For predictable conditions, such as snow removal, requirements contracts can be
considered. In either case, actual or sample purchase requests (AF Form 9) can be prepared in
advance with as much data filled in as possible. File these forms in a convenient location and note
this information in the CE CRP. Sample forms can be included in the plan. 
3.5.6.2.  In the case of bare bases, WRM or other vehicles may not be there at all. This is especially
true for ADR and other heavy equipment. Arranging for these items in advance may not be possi-
ble, but it becomes a high priority after a CE team arrives. The team leader must locate available
civilian equipment and simultaneously make contact with the contracting officer. This information
should be covered in the joint support plan for the beddown location. 
3.5.7.  Borrowing Vehicles. Depending on the location, it may be possible to borrow vehicles from
neighboring bases or other governmental agencies. If so, be sure to include what type of vehicles and
points of contact in the CRP. 
3.5.8.  Spare Parts. Because vehicles are so vital to CE performance, keeping them operating should
have a high priority. Work with base transportation to ensure specialized vehicle repair parts and tires
are available. 
3.6.  Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP). AFCAP is a contingent tool to provide Civil
Engineer and Services personnel with  a force multiplier by leveraging use of the commercial sector in
meeting urgent mission requirements. AFCAP is a cost  reimbursement or firm-fixed price contract tool
providing cost effective, responsive solutions to meet urgent realities of today. The AFCAP tool is only
available for contingency situations and designed for rapid design/c onstruction, service contracts and
logistics/commodity solutions. Depending on urgency, degree of requirements definition or task stability,
contracts can be tailored into firm-fixed price, cost-plus fixed fee or cost-plus award fee task orders. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008

3.6.1.  AFCAP consists of five key players; 1) the customer, 2) MAJCOM Civil Engineer or Director
of Services, 3) AFCAP program managers located at HQ AFCESA/CEO, 4) AFCAP contracting
officers (AETC Contracting Detachment at AFCESA), and 5) the six AFCAP contractors (Becht el,
CH2M Hill, DynCorp, Readiness Management Support, URS and Washington Group). The customer
is responsible for providing on-site contract administration, quality assurance and task order surveil-
lance. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer/Director of Services (or delegated individual) provides resource
advocacy, appropriate programming and guidance on execution method to complete tasks. The AFC-
ESA AFCAP program managers work as an interface between customers and the AFCAP contracting
officers to solidify requirements available under this contract. 
3.6.2.  AFCAP can be the right choi ce to satisfy increased support requirements and sustain forward
locations facing extended operational life. The AFCAP contract has provided continuity—many
AFCAP contractor personnel have been deployed for one year, or in many cases, longer. Power pro-
duction and professional engineers are two examples across Southwest Asia. AFCAP can and has pro-
vided everything from air traffic controllers, WRM equipment augmentation, power plants, heavy
equipment leases, and even rock quarry operations and concrete batch plants. For civil engineers, the
products and services can include: planning and design; infrastructure and facility construction, oper-
ation, maintenance, sustainment, revitalization; reconstitution—tear-down, clean-up, repacking, site
restoration, environmental restoration; disaster recovery (terrorist or natural disaster), and the list goes
on. Basically, AFCAP can perform any task expected from a CE, Services, or RED HORSE squadron,
with only a few exceptions. 
3.6.3.  Air Force policy imposes a few constraints on AFCAP use. The initial response and force bed-
down for military operations or exercise scenarios cannot be contracted. Public Law limits contracted
support for CONUS fire crash rescue  to only circumstances where a shortfall is caused by military
deployments. Also, contracted EOD support can be  for range clearance operations only . Lastly,
AFCAP is not allowed to run a mortuary operation (inherently Governmental) and cannot operate
field exchanges (money generating activity). 
3.6.4.  In addition to AFCAP, other Air Force wide contracts may be in place to fill contingent needs. 
3.6.4.1.  Contact AFCESA/CEO, Operations and Programs Support Directorate, at DSN 523-2275
or commercial 1-850-283-2275 to discuss specifics and assist you in getting the process started. A
task can be underway in 4 to7 working days, although in emergencies, it may take less than 24
hours. 
3.6.4.2.  The Air Force Center for Engineering a nd the Environment (AFCEE) also offers ready
access contract support services. Contact their Environmental and Construction Contracting
Directorate at DSN 240-6306 or commercial 210-536-6306 for inquiries. 
3.7.  Summary. Let personnel, supply, contracting, and transportation work unit requirements, but keep
close track of what they are doing. If the unit cannot satisfy needs with  assets on base, attempt to find
sources in the local community, at other Air Force bases, at other DOD military installations, with other
governmental agencies, or with HN military and civilian agencies. Always find out who to contact (name,
phone number, address) and what procedures to follow to obtain the desired assets. 
3.7.1.  Document that information in the CE CRP. The MAJCOM can be a great source of help to get
support moving to the base in a hurry. Make requests through the installation commander, but provide
82
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
the MAJCOM civil engineer a heads up. By doing that, the MAJCOM CE staff can start working solu-
tions to the problem even before a formal request for help arrives. 
3.7.2.  This chapter opened with a universal truth and closes with a second. CE needs the help of other
organizations to acquire resources. Unfortunately, they will not always—and sometimes cannot—
deliver the goods. It is tempting to blame others when the unit cannot obtain needed material to sup-
port the mission; avoid the urge. Keep the commander informed and look hard for other ways to
accomplish the job done. Do not take no for an answer, but be prepared to pay for the needed support.

Chapter 4  
ORGANIZING TO RESPOND 
4.1.  Introduction. Organizing CE response teams before a disaster occurs reduces initial postdisaster con-
fusion and helps initiate recovery activities quickly. A unit may not have all the personnel or equipment
needed, but effective organization helps make the resources that are available more effectual. Anticipate
what tasks will be required before, during, and after a crisis—and then  ensure teams are organized and
trained to perform each task. 
4.2.  Overview. This chapter highlights how a typical Air Force base organizes to respond to disasters and
how civil engineers fit into that organization. It provides an example of how CE squadrons can organize
for peacetime postdisaster response and wartime postattack response to  recover the base. The chapter
details the role and composition of  special response teams that civil engineers may need, and offers tips
for organizing those teams. It closes by discussing the organizational relationship the host CE squadron
should maintain with augmentees during contingency operations. 
4.3.  Base Organization for Disaster Response. The Ai r Force relies on the Inst allation Control Center
(ICC) and Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for both peacetime and wartime airbase command and
control organization. Additional information on the organization and manning of the ICC and EOC can be
found in AFMAN 10-2501. The base level organization for disaster response and base recovery can vary
between bases, but the differences are not usually significant, often only in name. Regardless of how the
base is organized, similar functions and tasks must be performed pe rmitting some relatively universal
observations about organizing for disaster and wartime responses. 
4.3.1.  Peacetime Emergencies. The base level disast er response structure is flexible, allowing it to
adapt to the situation. Normal base emergency response forces (i.e., FES, security forces, or base med-
ical services) handle minor incidents. As resp onse requirements become more complex, the emer-
gency response organizational structure expands both horizontally and vertically. The peacetime
organization focuses on saving lives and protecting property. In 2004, the Air Force formally adopted
the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS) to com-
ply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5 to have a single integrated disaster man-
agement system. The NIMS concept, and organizational and command structure, is used to respond to
major accidents, natural disasters, and other peacetime contingencies beyond the full-time emergency
response agencies. This concept is implemented as the Air Force Incident Management System
(AFIMS) as defined in AFI 10-2501. 
4.3.2.  Base Attack Re covery Operations. In high threat areas, enemy combatants, terrorism, and
insurgency actions can be expected. Bases should prepare for damage , intense recovery actions, and
possible hazards, such as UXO and chemical warfare agents, following an attack. 
4.3.2.1.  The ICC, led by the wing commander, is responsible for controlling all wing activities to
support higher headquarters’ taskings. The activities include such things as sortie generation, air-
craft maintenance, base defense, base recovery, etc. Since the ICC may be saturated with opera-
tional tasks and requirements, the EOC is established as a command and control element to direct
and monitor preattack survival ac tions and postattack recovery. The EOC, normally directed by
the mission support group comma nder, receives mission requirements from the ICC. The EOC
then provides recovery guidance to lower level organizations, usually through their control c en-
84
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
ters. Just as with peacetime responses, civil engineers play a major role in base recovery opera-
tions. 
4.3.2.2.  This is not a wholesale organizational change from the peacetime disaster response struc-
ture. In fact, the two organizational structures are more alike than different. One difference in the
wartime EOC is focus. The wartime EOC organization, like its predecessor the Survival Recovery
Center (SRC), is created to restore mission capability first and then to save lives and protect prop-
erty. In many locations the wartime EOC may closely resemble the SRC in manning and activities
as the entities' requirements have  not significantly changed and th e EOC construct is flexible to
allow for the similarities while the AF adopts a common set of terminology in line with NIMS and
AFIMS. 
4.4.  Civil Engineer Squadron. Now to the real thrust of this chapter—organizing the CE unit for disaster
response and base recovery. Figure 4.1. outlines the peacetime organization for a typical CE squadron,
and Figure 4.2. shows a further breakout of the operations flight. Alth ough the actual organization can
vary between units, this basic structure is sound fo r responding to most crises. Some or ganizational
adjustments must be made for a crisis, especially during war. 
4.4.1.  The base civil engineer gene rally controls CE responses from either the CE UCC or from the
EOC, depending upon the situation. As a rule of thum b, the BCE will be in the EOC to provide sup-
port to the mission support group commander. When in the EOC, the BCE has a small staff from var-
ious flights within the CE community to run the CE operations with in the EOC facility. This small
staff is filling Emergency Support Functions (ESF) along with the Readiness and Emergency Manage-
ment Flight (the installation’s emergency managers and OPR for ESF 5). In  a contingency environ-
ment, additional personnel are added to perform emergency management cell activities and to receive
and plot facility damage and UX Os. The BCE provides direction to  the CE DCC and to the few CE
teams that are directly controlled from the EOC (normally FES, Readiness/Emergency Management
and EOD teams through their senior staff representatives accomplishing ESFs 4 and 5 roles). 
4.4.2.  In any disaster, the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight Chief and flight personnel
perform many key functions. Th ey advise the mission support group commander and the BCE on
response options. They act as fac ilitators and coordinators for the DRF. They activate the EOC and
respond on-scene with the MEOC, depending on the situation. In each case, they are the custodians of
the command and control fa cilities and are responsible for doing the little and big things needed to
keep the EOC or the MEOC operating. The base readiness support team augments the primary Readi-
ness and Emergency Management Flight personnel as required. 
4.4.3.  Other than the FACC, engineers must activate a control center to direct the efforts of CE forces.
The control center keeps the CE fo rces focused on what is most im portant and arranges support for
them. Normally, the Operations Flight Commander leads the cont rol center and is supported by
selected flight chiefs, element leaders, damage plotters, and radio operators. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
85
Figure 4.1.  Standard CE Squadron Organization and Manning. 
Figure 4.2.  CE Operations Flight Organization Chart. 
4.4.4.  There are some conditions when the CE disaster control center supports, but does not direct, the
actions of selected CE teams. At major accidents and for “normal” emergencies, firefighters are con-
trolled on-scene by an incident commander (IC) that is the senior fire officer (SFO), and supported by
the FACC and the CE control center. During recovery operations, the IC will direct operations at the
incident site. In addition, during recovery operations, the damage assessment teams (DAT) and EOD
teams are normally controlled directly from the EOC due to time sensitive response requirements. 
4.4.5.  Another organizational adjustment is to form teams capable of responding to anticipated emer-
gencies and performing recovery tasks in respons e to the emergency. When possible, organizing
response teams should be nothing mo re than assigning anticipated tasks to existing BCE shops or
flights. Ideally, every response team would consist of individuals from only one shop. Doing so eases
command and control and logistics problems, esp ecially if the same crews and leaders are kept
together for all tasks. But indi vidual shops are not always or ganized with the personnel, skills, or
equipment to handle large scale or major multi-skill tasks. Consequently, BCEs must often combine
the capabilities from two or more shops, or flights, to respond adequately. Form a multi-shop team by
selecting a lead shop to perform a task and augment that team from other shops when additional capa-
bilities are needed. 
86
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
4.4.6.  Each crisis drives dif ferent requirements. However, the response and recovery tasks required
during many crises are similar. Therefore, civil engineers can form relatively few teams to do common
tasks. The process of building teams requires a unit to decide what situations to plan for, what tasks to
perform for each situation, and what shops or multi-shop teams to assign to the tasks. 
4.5.  Civil Engineer Response Teams. Many peacetime emergencies can be handled without forming
multi-shop teams, but a major natural disaster, a major accident, or a base attack definitely requires spe-
cial teams in addition to standard shop support. The following paragraphs outline three scenarios and sug-
gest the types of teams to form in response to each crisis. They are just exam ples and not meant to be
all-inclusive. They are offered to help prepare for other crises that may be faced as well. The structure and
personnel of the objective squadron are used for these examples. No distinction was made between mili-
tary or civilian positions. In any shop, everyone must be able to do the assigned tasks. When appropriate,
augmentees from the base augmentation duty program are us ed, especially the readiness support team.
These scenarios do not apply to every base, so use what information applies and set aside the rest. Adjust
the proposed teams to fit local base requirements and resources, and include the details in the contingency
response plan (see Attachment 3). 
4.6.  Bomb Threat. Any installation can be the target of a bomb threat. The EOC usually directs the base
response to bomb threats. Security forces and civil engineers play major roles. CE EOD forces render safe
explosive devices while other CE forces take actions to limit damage should a device explode. This threat
can involve a number of CE shops, but probably not the entire unit. This is a scenario that CE peacetime
organization supports well. While the control center may be activated, no special multi-shop teams need
to be formed. The CE response is outlined in Table 4.1. Additional details on other teams follow in Table
4.2. Other CE shops may also be pl ayers in a bomb threat. For exampl e, the heavy repair element can
build soil blast berms or place heavy equipment to form blast barriers or traffic barricades. When other
shops are called on, they can expect to perform tasks they commonly do or require no extra training. Such
tasks are identified on-scene and cannot be anticipated. Upon notification of a crisis, sharp shop leaders
decide which work crews or individuals they would dispatch if called upon and give those individuals a
heads-up. This last bit of common sense applies to every crisis. 
4.7.  Major Natural Disaster. No matter its location, ever y base is vulnerable to some form of natural
disaster. In this scenario, reestablishing the flying mission may not be the most immediate priority, the
ICC will provide guidance as to its relative priority. Support from off base or from other military units is
available, but not necessarily in the local area. CE can assume facilities and utility systems are damaged
across the entire base. Such a disaster requires a base wide response, and that response is controlled from
the EOC through unit contro l centers. This example is included to show how an entire CE unit might
respond to a situation that  can be supported from the existing shops. A few multi-shop teams may be
required. A logical assignment of functions to shops or teams is outlined in Table 4.1. Of course, an actual
situation can easily dictate adjustments to this list.

Comments 
The MEOC is driven to the disaster site to 
provide communications capabilities for the 
incident commander.  Readiness flight 
personnel advise and assist the incident 
commander on emergency response procedures.  
Team also maintains on-scene incident events 
log and an emergency communications 
capability through the MEOC.  One person 
should staff the MEOC while the other stays 
close by the incident commander to advise him 
or her.  Readiness personnel are not in command.  
During initial response, the senior Fire Officer, 
EOD or Security Forces representative will generally 
be the incident commander. 
Advises the EOC director of CE related issues 
and coordinates CE recovery teams once senior 
FES, EOD or SF personnel turn over command 
after initial response phase is complete. 
  Members record and plot damage and hazards; 
keep track of recovery status; answer phones and 
operate CE radios and keep counterparts in the DCC 
informed. CBRN Defense Cell directs the CBRN 
surveillance teams and provides technical guidance 
to unit shelter management teams. 
Depending upon perceived threat and 
availability of forces, this team may only 
consist of 2-3 personnel to maintain continuity 
if the primary center is destroyed.  Some bases 
may choose not to staff an alternate EOC until 
Table 4.1 continued on next page.

environment.  That number includes the EOD 
representatives in the EOC.  Four to 
five 2-person teams per shift are 
Technical jobs need to be performed by trained

4.8.  Base Recovery Operations—Initial Response. This scenario applies to overseas bases that are subject
to a major enemy air attack. In this example, assume airfield pavements, facilities, and utility systems are
extensively damaged. The damage prevents the aircraft from flying and hinders aircraft generation activ-
ities. In the first few hours after the attack, the overriding base priority is to get the aircraft flying again.
The base-wide response is controlled from the EOC through unit control centers. Support from off-base or
from other military units is not available. This requires the use of ADR equipment. Special teams must be
formed within the CE organization to give priority to recovery actions that quickly restore the flying mis-
sion. A listing of needed teams is outlined in Table 4.1. Because this effort is equipment intensive and
there are not enough heavy equipment operators to cover all pieces of equipment, many specialties must
learn to operate equipment they do not normally use. Except for firefighting, this organizational arrange-
ment covers a 12-hour shift. 
4.9.  Thoughts on Organizing Teams. A few thoughts may help put the pr ocess of organizing response
teams into perspective. 
4.9.1.  A unit can or ganize too much. It is so easy and tempting to organize every response, but the
results become complicated and confusing; fight the urge and keep things simple. If it does not make
sense to someone, it probably is not the best approach. 
4.9.2.  Team members must be told what team they are on, where to report when called, what tools and
equipment they are to bring, and who is in charge. 
4.9.3.  Give a little extra attention to tasks that need quick team response, those that are not normally
performed in the peacetime base O&M environment (things personnel have little experience with),
and those that need extra training as a team to be effective. 
4.9.4.  Be aware of dual tasking shops; it is only a problem if two jobs require accomplishment simul-
taneously. 
4.9.5.  If someone can perform a task, it does not matter if that person has the right AFSC or is in the
right shop. 
4.9.6.  A changing organizational structure is not a problem. Over the years, the CE organization has
changed a number of times in response to functional transformations and technology integration.
Engineers still have the same missions to accomplish and the same skills available. It remains a matter
of assigning the right tasks to the right shop, and augmenting as needed. 
4.9.7.  There are no hard rules on organizing teams. Therefore, there is no right or wrong solutions; if
it works—use it. 
4.10.  Augmenting Forces. Operations plans call for CONUS Prime BEEF  forces to deploy overseas in
support of deployed flying squadrons (Figure 4.3.). Upon arrival, a deployed Prime BEEF unit will aug-
ment the in-place CE organization, if applicable. If the team is a follow Prime BEEF team, it will augment
the lead team. Ideally, preparations for this augmentation begin well before the team arrives, in the case of
an in-place force. Vehicles and equipment need to be provided. Command and control relationships need
to be worked out. To minimize the problems of integration, the augmenting Prime BEEF force is placed
under the operational control of the host BCE or lead team commander. 
96
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Figure 4.3.  CE Organization with Augmenting Prime BEEF Units. 
4.10.1.  This pamphlet and other documents consistently stress the value of team integrity and having
personnel work for the same leaders, even in changing situations. If that concept is good for the unit,
it also applies to a Prime BEEF augmentation team. When possible, they should maintain their unit
integrity. Task them through their representatives in the control center in much the same way CE
assigns tasks to their own forces. The augmenting unit commander then ensures those tasks are com-
pleted. This approach, rather than total integration, is taken since the Prime BEEF team and host unit
are organized and trained separately. As a result, individuals know th eir leaders, have learned their
coworker’s strengths and weaknesses, and have learned to work as a team . This cohesion results in
more efficient and better-controlled repair efforts. 
4.10.2.  There should be sufficient commonality of training so that both units can work side-by-side to
recover the base. On some tasks, the combined skills of both units will be required. In those circum-
stances, a work crew/team from one unit should be detailed (loaned) to the other unit for a specific
task. When that task is complete, the loaned crew should return to the control of its parent unit, unless
the crew is immediately reassigned to another joint task. 
4.10.3.  Some recovery tasks require detailed knowledge of the host base, such as those involving the
utility systems. When assigning those tasks to the augmenting unit, the host BCE should detail at least
one host unit expert to help each augmenting work crew. 
4.10.4.  There are logical exceptions to this “rule.” Forces deploying as part of small UTCs will inte-
grate with the lead Prime BEEF team or the host USAF  civil engineer organization. Personnel from
the same UTC can still be assigned to the same work crew to maintain some form of integrity. All fire-
fighters will integrate with the USAF host or lead unit firefighters. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
97
4.10.5.  Not every Prime BEEF tea m deploys to a MOB. COBs of fer even greater possibilities for
variation since USAF units must integrate their efforts with host nation forces. As a deploying unit,
determine how things are organized and adjust to the differences. Be sure to inform unit personnel
what the adjustments are. 
4.11.  Summary. Civil Engineers are major players in most crisis responses. Consequently, the unit must
anticipate what crises may be faced and what tasks to complete in order to provide adequate support to the
base and its mission. Then, assign those tasks to existing shops or special teams with the required skill to
accomplish the task at hand.

Chapter 5  
TRAINING 
5.1.  Introduction. Plans can be perfect; equipment and supplies on-hand; the unit and response teams well
organized, and yet not ready for war, military operations, or peacetime disasters. The unit must train for
those contingencies—mentally, physically, individually, and as a team. Unlike many units, such as aircraft
maintenance, civil engineers’ contingency tasks are not the same as t hose accomplished in the course of
everyday work. Just as football teams have preseason practice to hone skills lost during the off-season and
to incorporate new players, civil engineers must ha ve periodic practice to develop and maintain skills
needed to respond effectively to disasters, military operations, and war. Such training is inherently a unit
responsibility. Ideally, that training would be conducted entirely at home station, but the reality of limited
resources makes that impossible. Consequently, civil engineers must rely on home station training to pre-
pare disaster responses and to develop basic skills for other contingencies. Both military and civilian per-
sonnel must be involved. For trai ning on equipment not available at  home station, and for training in
situations that cannot be recreated there, civil engineers mainly rely on training provided at one of the Air
Force's Silver Flag sites and its associated exercise, which prepares key members of Prime BEEF teams to
perform both force beddown and wartime base recovery tasks and assesses the success of training. There
are other training opportunities for engineers, but these two pr ograms—Home Station Training and the
Silver Flag—are the foundation for Air Force Civil Engineer contingency and disaster response training.
While Air Force instructions prescribe contingency training requirements, the unit’s success in dealing
with a contingency or a disaster depends largely on how well it defines training needs, how often it trains,
and how well it plans and executes. 
5.2.  Overview. This chapter highlights CE contingency training requirements and demonstrates how indi-
vidual training and the two foundation programs satisfy many of those requirements. Discussions include
the classroom topics of category I home station traini ng and the “hands-on” lessons of category II. The
reader is introduced to other unit training for disaster response and a “leadership training work center” to
improve leadership skills. Some special contingency courses are also mentioned. The target audience for
this chapter is the Readiness and Emer gency Management Flight staff, the unit officers, and anyone
tasked to conduct unit level training. While tar geted to Prime BEEF units, the in formation is useful for
RED HORSE squadrons as well. 
5.3.  CE Training Requirements. “What training is mandated? What skills does the unit need? Where can
the unit find out what it should do?” These are the universal and logical questions everyone asks who has
ever been assigned to train others. This section should help identify individual and team training require-
ments for contingency and disaster responses. CE requirements are found in a number of Air Force publi-
cations, where they are adequately described. Rather than repeat the details, they are highlighted here and
their source documents identified. Some requirements, however, will result from planning rather than
from a publication. Most requirements can be grouped in one of the foll owing seven categories: 1) indi-
vidual specialty skills, 2) ancillary training, 3) wartime and other contingency tasks, 4) disaster response
tasks, 5) base orientation, 6) leadership, and 7) command and control. Unit orientation requirements could
be incorporated into other sections in this paragraph, but are treated separately to give them visibility. The
actual training should be combined with in-processi ng activities and other training whenever possible.
Deployed CE forces augmenting the unit also need this training and information. Make checklists to iden-
tify points to cover with augmenting forces. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
99
5.3.1.  Individual Specialty Skills. Individual specialty skills are the basis for everything done by civil
engineers. When individuals are well qualified, not only can they pe rform the routine tasks, but also
more importantly, they can figure out work-around methods when standard procedures do not work.
This ability to adapt is critical  for contingency and disaster res ponses, and it comes with improved
skills and experience. 
5.3.1.1.  The skill requirements are found in th e Career Field Education and T raining Plan
(CFETP) for each Air Force enlisted specialty. Part 2 of the CFETP contains the Specialty Train-
ing Standard (STS) that outlines specific core tasks that all pers onnel in that Air Force specialty
are required to perform, along with other common skills routinely performed in the specialty. It
highlights the required training that each individual attending appr entice technical training must
receive and indicates the minimum tasks that must be mastered to upgrade their skill level. Ideally,
when individuals meet these standa rds, they will be able to per form when called on in a crisis.
Experts in each specialty update the required tasks in the CFETPs periodically, about every 3
years. In addition to being familiar with the 32EX CFETP, each officer should quickly review all
CE enlisted STSs at least once and preferably after each update. Mobility team leaders should
know what skills their personnel possess. If necessary, a craftsman in each specialty can explain
unfamiliar skills to team leaders and provide an evaluation of the overall state of proficiency of the
team. 
5.3.1.2.  For US civilian employees, the performance requirements for CE trades can be found in
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Qu alification Standards. OPM standards do not
apply to local-hire civilian employees at overseas bases, but similar performance requirements can
be found at the local Civilian Personnel Office. Individual job descriptions contain the most useful
information. 
5.3.2.  Ancillary Training. The Air Force mandates a few training programs to ensure Air Force per-
sonnel have certain knowledge and skills that are not part of thei r specialty training. Civil engineers
must complete these ancillary courses: Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) Course; Law of
Armed Conflict; Protection from Terrorism; and Self Aid and Buddy Care. There are other courses,
but these deal with emergencies and contingencies. 
5.3.3.  CE Wartime and Other Contingency Tasks. Skilled individuals are critical, but skilled teams
enable civil engineers to meet their war fighting and contingency responsibilities. Team requirements
are outlined in AFI 10-210. This instruction specifies tasks, team composition, and performance stan-
dards. It covers basic wartime knowledge plus mobilization, expedient repair and destruction, expedi-
ent field construction, expedient beddown, passive defense, base recovery, survivability support, fire
and emergency services, readiness, and explosive ordnance disposal tasks. The instruction tar gets
Prime BEEF teams both stationed overseas and in CONUS. 
5.3.4.  Disaster Response Tasks. AFI 10-2501 specifies mandatory training requirements to help pre-
pare individuals and the base for peacetime disaster responses, wartime CBRNE defensive operations,
and unit Readiness operations. Courses are presented to dif ferent groups on base to satisfy these
requirements. All military personnel and emer gency-essential civilians assigned to base level Civil
Engineer units will receive Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation, Air Force Emergency Man-
agement Program Planning and Operations, and quarterly informational updates to support the Emer-
gency Management Installation Information Program. The quarterly informational updates keep the
base populace informed of seasonal hazards and protective actions; security and awareness measures
specific to the installation; and types of attacks, major accidents, hazardous material incidents, and
100
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
natural disasters most likely to occur at the installation. They also provide commanders an opportunity
to update personnel on CBRNE related tasks and other procedures identified as needing improvement
during exercises and inspections. 
5.3.5.  Emergency Response Training. Civil engineers must ensure that immediate response teams are
well trained. Areas include: fire and emergency services, readiness support for command and control,
and hazardous material (HAZMAT) spills. HAZMAT response training requirements are extensive
and often require formal certification. See AFI 10-2501 for additional information on this subject. 
5.3.6.  Base Orientation. Unlike most CE training requirements that  are relatively universal, a few
apply only to the base CE unit. There is no comprehensive list, but the following provide some exam-
ples. 
5.3.6.1.  Job assignments and responsibilities. 
5.3.6.2.  Location of equipment. 
5.3.6.3.  Location of supplies. 
5.3.6.4.  Utility system isolation procedures. 
5.3.6.5.  Priority units and facilities. 
5.3.7.  Leadership. Effective leadership is the one universal and essential requirement a team, flight, or
squadron requires in order to meet its mission taskings. The more critical and time sensitive the tasks,
the more important good leadership becomes. Developing leadership skills can begin at school, but
those skills can only mature in the field. Junior officers are often in charge of Prime BEEF and RED
HORSE teams and sent on deployments to “help” develop their skills. Some do well in such “tests by
fire” and some do not. But in any situation, it is not fair to the team or the leader when he or she is not
adequately prepared and trained. The structure of  the civil engineer squadron provides good leader-
ship opportunities for a few officers, but not for all. Create opportunities at home station to help offic-
ers and NCOs develop and practice their leadership skills, especially those who are not currently in
leadership positions. 
5.3.7.1.  The focus should be on junior officers and NCOs to create a pool of experienced leaders.
Begin by giving them challenging jobs in local exercises. Have them set up and conduct unit-train-
ing programs or lead a squadron/unit bivouac. Form this group into teams and assign them a con-
struction project to research, de sign, plan, order material, and buil d. Junior leaders need to learn
how to balance taking care of their troops and completing the mission on time. This can be accom-
plished through ad hoc construction teams, or a more permanent “leadership training work cen-
ter.” The training opportunities are limited only by the unit’s imagination and the willingness to try
new things. 
5.3.7.2.  Whatever challenge the junior leaders are given, they need to be told what their task or
job is to be and understand from their supervisor  or commander what is expected of them. They
need to be trained and then turned loose. Us e unit training and local ex ercises or construction
projects to test them. Junior leaders need oversight and constructive feedback, more so at the
beginning and less as they gain experience. This is not solely the job of the commander. A unit’s
senior officers and NCOs have an obligation to guide their juniors. There is nothing wrong with a
senior NCO giving private counsel to a junior officer. Hopefully, junior officers will recognize the
value and ask for such feedback. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
101
5.3.7.3.  The commander must create the environment and set the tone for the senior leaders’ par-
ticipation. It takes an ongoing commitment to train junior leadership, because new ones continu-
ously join the unit. In the short term, it seems like a sacrifice to take the lieutenants away from the
drawing board and the junior NCOs out of the shops where they can be “productive.” But training
the next generation of leaders is a fundamental responsibility of all CE senior leaders. 
5.3.8.  Command and Control. This is another requirement that could be incorporated into other cate-
gories. Like leadership training, it is critical to the success of the CE mission and requires emphasis.
This section highlights just two training topics that  officers, senior NCOs, and key civilians need to
prepare them to direct unit respon se effectively to crises, disasters, contingencies, war, or any other
military operation. 
5.3.8.1.  OPLAN Familiarization. Unit leaders must become fa miliar with operations plans
requirements (that affect the base), the In-Gar rison Expeditionary support plan, the CEMP 10-2,
the CE Contingency Response Plan, hazardous material spill plans, and checklists that support the
plans. Each leader should depart from familiarization sessions knowing what their section must do
to support each plan. Review the list of plans in Chapter 2. Before conducting those sessions,
decide which plans are most important, not all need to be covered in one sitting. Prepare well for
these sessions, short handouts and enthusiastic pres entations will speed the learning process and
help everyone focus. 
5.3.8.2.  Control Center Familiarization. Personnel working in the CE Control Centers (damage
control center, FACC, etc.) or the EOC must be come familiar with the la yout and resources in
their control center. They should know what sources of information are available and how to use
the communications equipment. 
5.3.8.3.  Common Sense Requirements. Remember , the common sense ap proach to training
requirements always applies. If the unit has to plan for something, then train for it. If not mandated
in writing, but the task is a known requirement, train for it anyway. 
5.4.  Individual Training. Home station and Silver Flag training may be  the foundation for CE contin-
gency responses, but individual specialty skills remain the bedrock. Air Education and T raining Com-
mand (AETC) teaches basic skills to enlisted military personnel before they report to their first duty
station, but these airmen do not arrive fully qualified in all tasks. Using the football team analogy again,
airmen come to the team with basic skills, but they need to improve on those skills to be ef fective team
players. Each Airman will improve their skills through on-the-job (OJT) training, career development
courses (CDC), and contingency training. Qualification Training Packages (QTP) and other multi-media
products are used for upgrade and refresher training. Civilian employees also come to the job with man-
datory minimum skills and can improve their skills on the job. Just as with the military, they may attend
AETC courses to acquire additional skills. 
5.4.1.  Demand Quality On-the-Job Training. Most supervisors do a good job with OJT. However, if
individuals from a shop consistently cannot perform a required task, the OJT program in that shop is
probably weak. Use senior NCOs to find and fix these type problems. Occasionally, some supervisors
are willing to pencil whip requirements to “help” a friend or make their records look good. That prac-
tice is illegal and it is unfair to Airmen who study and train hard to earn their upgrade. It also misleads
the commander and the unit about its capabilities. If someone arrives in the unit who is unqualified to
perform a needed task, return them to training stat us, even if the Airman was previously qualified.
Otherwise, under-qualified Airmen may be put unknowingly in charge of a task. 
102
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
5.4.2.  Set Up a Study Center. Many units have already done this in the fire department and some in a
separate training section. Make it comfortable an d attractive. Fill it with current study materials
including CDCs, videos, computer programs, etc. Provide more than one videocassette recorder
(VCR) or digital videodisk (DVD) player to support multiple training activities simultaneously. Inter-
net connectivity is a must now that many training programs are now web-based. Keep the study center
quiet by utilizing headphones when possible to keep the noise leve ls down. Since multi-media com-
puter based training is a valuable training tool, add fast computers (with a lot of memory) to the study
center and begin with at least tw o. Attempt to keep the study cent er open during other than normal
duty hours. This will require e xperimentation with the hours to determine when Airmen are best
served. Since all shops benefit, share the manpower burden to k eep the study center open among
shops. Rather than operating the study center via a duty roster, designate Airmen for a 3- to 6-month
“tour” to keep it open during the non-duty hours. Train the designated attendants so they can teach
others how to use the equipment, know where to look for requested study materials, and know the pro-
cedures to loan materials. Rotate the attendants so the same ones do not always get stuck with the least
desirable hours. The usefulness of the study center will increase as the category I home station train-
ing program evolves and other mult i-media training is added, such as Qualification Training Pack-
ages. 
5.4.3.  Encourage Officer and Enlisted Professional Reading. There is no career development course
for CE officers, but that does not diminish their obligation to develop their contingency skills. Each
officer should make a personal commitment to thoroughly read each of the volumes in this pamphlet
series before he or she completes two years of service. This obligation also extends to reviewing the
referenced documents and learning what information they contain. Likewise, they should make it a
habit to read books on le adership and wartime conduct. Although, the focus above is on the of ficer
professional reading, the professional NCO should also be encouraged to read similar books that will
help them expand their skills and ability to provide solid NCO leadership. 
5.5.  Home Station Training. Home station is the primary place to develop basic skills the unit requires for
military operations and disaster responses in war and peace. Some home station training is mandated,
other elements are not, but all are intended to build capable teams. Home station training is extremely
important. For 70 percent of the Pr ime BEEF team, this may be the only contingency training they will
receive. This section explores six HST programs: Category I “c lassroom” training, Category II
“hands-on” training, ancillary training, installation emergency management training, other unit training
and exercises, and base exercises. AFI 10-210 is the source document for CE contingency training. 
5.5.1.  Category I Training. “CAT I” knowledge-level training provides the baseline information engi-
neers need to perform contingency tasks as a team. The gained knowledge prepares Airmen for Cate-
gory II hands-on training and is an important prerequisite for Silver Flag Exercise activities. Category
I training takes on added importance when it is the only method to expose engineers to a task when the
unit does not have the needed equipment or res ources for hands-on training. Personnel assigned to
base level Civil Engineer units will receive initial and refresher training in all CAT I topics as shown
in AFI 10-210, Attachment 2. Initial or recurring CAT I training can be satisfied by completing either
unit classroom training, the General Continge ncy Responsibilities CD-ROM (GCRCD), or
Web-based courses available on the CE Virtual Learning Center (VLC) website. See AFI 10-210 for
more details on CAT I training options. 
5.5.2.  A synopsis of the CAT I training program follows. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
103
5.5.2.1.  Prime BEEF Orientation/General Contingency. Upon assignment to the unit, train all mil-
itary and emergency-essential civilian employees on the unit’s Prime BEEF and Emergency Man-
agement missions. Emphasize the individual’s role and how it contributes to the program. Include
an overview of Civil Engineer Doctrine and explain the organization, training, equipment, operat-
ing concepts, and contingency missions pertaining to the unit.  The Prime BEEF manager will
update unit personnel on sign ificant changes to the programs as  they occur. This sub-category
training also includes general contingency skills such as Enemy Prisoner of War Handling, AOR
Specific General Orders, Operations Security, and CBRNE Defense Awareness Training. 
5.5.2.2.  Combat Skills. Provide CE leadership and their personnel combat skills training, such as
Troop Leading Procedures, Convoy Ops, Land Navigation and Ma p Reading, Air Base Defense,
Work Party Security, Team Movement Techniques, Operating in a Joint Environment, and Use of
Night Vision Goggles. 
5.5.2.3.  Field Sanitation and Heal th Training. This training includes Problems of Extreme Cli-
mates and Field Sanitation and Personal Hygiene. 
5.5.2.4.  Expedient Methods. Expedient methods trai ning will address three areas: Force Bed-
down, Field Construction, and Repair Methods. 
5.5.2.4.1.  Force Beddown. Force beddown subjects will include information on BEAR assets
as well as package configurations and pla ybook options. Lessons should cover items such as
environmental protection; bare base layout; BEAR water, mechanical, and electrical utility
systems; wartime construction management; and resource dispersal. 
5.5.2.4.2.  Field Construction. Fi eld construction includes information on facility hardening
and construction of field latrines, berms, and dikes. 
5.5.2.4.3.  Repair Methods. Repair methods will include te chniques for DCC command and
control, minimum essential restoration of damaged facilities or utility systems including elec-
trical, plumbing, road, and building repairs; shoring and scabbing; and war damage repair to
the airfield, facilities, and utilities). 
5.5.2.5.  Emergency Management and CBRN Response. This training is tar geted towards Emer-
gency Management personnel and covers CBRN Cell Operations and HAZMAT Awareness Level
1 and 2 Certification. 
5.5.2.6.  Force Protection. Force protection w ill introduce military Prime BEEF members to the
concepts of military vehicle operator training, personal and work party security, revetments, and
obstacles. 
5.5.3.  Category II Training. The ideal training method is for the trainee to physically perform a task
and repeat it until becoming proficient—“hands-on” is the thrust of category II training. Make every
effort to incorporate realism into CAT II training programs. Use field gear (to include primary weap-
ons) as the “norm” rather than the exception whenever training on topics such as personal/work party
security, convoy operations, defensive fighting posi tions, etc. Category II topics are highlighted in
AFI 10-210, Attachment 3. To help guide CAT II training efforts, lesson plans for each task have been
developed and posted on the AFCESA website at https://wwwmil.afcesa.af.mil/Directorate/CEX/
CEXX/ContingencyTrng/HST_LessonPlans.asp. Use of these lesson plans is mandatory and wil l
help assure continuity of trai ning throughout the entire CE comm unity. If a new topic is added,
develop an in-house plan until the standard plan becomes available on the website. Often, the unit can
104
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
combine the training of many tasks into a single training period. On the other hand, complex tasks, or
those that require a lot of person nel, can be broken down into sub-tasks. Frequently, it is helpful to
train smaller size crews in the sub-tasks before attempting to train an entire crew or team in the full
task. With few exceptions, results will be better when training personnel in small groups of 10 to 15.
Category II training is mandatory for CE personnel, but it can still be fun. It takes more effort to set up
such a training program, but it is worth it. Train Airmen well the first time, they will require less fre-
quent refresher training and those refresher sessions will be faster. Some observations concerning the
general category II topics follow. 
5.5.3.1.  Government Vehicle and Equipment Operations Training. Airfield damage repair in a
high threat environment requires many vehicles moving at the same time to make the needed
repairs. In that situation, a t ypical CE unit has too few heavy eq uipment operators. To solve this
shortfall, civil engineers must train other individuals in the unit to operate selected vehicles. AFI
10-210, Table 4.4, outlines the requirements. Overs eas bases should have little trouble meeting
these requirements if they have the equipm ent on-hand. CONUS Prime BEEF units have a huge
challenge without the equipment. Consequently, train with what is available to the unit and borrow
items from other bases if possibl e. Units may also send person nel to the Regional Equipment
Operator Training Sites. 
5.5.3.2.  Unit CBRNE Defense Training. Basic CBRNE training is provided through the Installa-
tion EM Training Program as outlined in table 6.3 and para graphs 6.6.1.2 and 6.6.1.3 of AFI
10-2501. However, additional unit training is required to gain proficiency. This includes task qual-
ification training, equipment and large area decontamination training, shelter management train-
ing for selected individuals, and training to process in and ou t of a toxic free area. Each unit is
required to ensure its personnel can perform their wartime roles in a chemical or biological war-
fare environment. For civil engineers, this means base recovery activities. Overseas bases have the
advantage again because they have the equipment available. The biggest need is for personnel to
experience the physical limitations they face when performing base recovery activities in chemi-
cal warfare defense ensembles. During task qualification training, practice equipment decontami-
nation and shelter in- and out-processing; a shelter is not required to practice these steps. Open air
contamination control area processing can be pe rformed. Spray personnel and equipment with a
telltale chemical before they decontaminate equipment or themselves. Under an ultraviolet light,
the absence of the telltale chemical reveals whether or not if the decontamination efforts were suc-
cessful. 
5.5.3.3.  Field Health. All Prime BEEF personnel will complete hands-on training in Self-Aid and
Buddy Care training and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) certification. 
5.5.3.4.  Expedient Methods (Be ddown). To maximize training opportunities, include some of
these tasks in base exercises as well as durin g regular unit training. Tasks in this area include
TEMPER tent and small shelter system erection, preway heater set up, and generator set opera-
tions. Unfortunately many of the assets are not available at home station. To compensate for this
shortfall, emphasize the information learned in category I training and make  sure the personnel
who attend the Silver Flag Exercise become “experts.” 
5.5.3.5.  Weapon Skills. All military Prime BEEF personnel assigned to a UTC will qualify with
their primary duty weapon. Ensure individuals performing courier, guard, in-flight security, fire
chief, or similar duties are trai ned to fire the pistol. Individuals assigned to Prime BEEF deploy-
able and associated UTCs are included in arming Group B and will train to that frequency. Excep-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
105
tion: Personnel in DXX coded s tandard deployable UTCs and in AXX coded associated UTCs
will receive “just-in-time” training. Getting quotas can be a problem, especially for units that do
not have a small arms range on base. Freque nt communications and good working relationship
with the Security Forces Squadron combat arms training (CATM) flight will eliminate most prob-
lems. 
5.5.3.6.  Combat Skills. In addition to weapons handling proficiency, Combat Skills training
emphasizes command, control, and communications procedures; land navigation and map read-
ing; individual/team movement techniques and combat organization; troop leading procedures;
and construction of defensive positions. T rain military Prime BEEF members on personal and
work party security; night operations; convoy operations, and air base defense operations. Include
defensive combat skills that could be required while performing contingency tasks. 
5.5.3.6.1.  Defensive combat skills and work party security training should concentrate on the
basics: detection methods, sign/countersign measures, rules of engagement, and reporting pro-
cedures. Training in command, control, communications, and signals is especially important. 
5.5.3.6.1.1.  Find out if, how, and when Security Forces will pl an to use CE in airbase
defense operations and train for those roles. Security for convoy operations is also impor-
tant. Lessons learned indicate that civil engineers often find  themselves providing their
own convoy security. 
5.5.3.6.1.2.  Civil engineers are weapons-limited, with RED HORSE being the exception.
CE has no crew served weapons (like M-60 mach ine guns), mortars, grenades, etc. With-
out those items, personnel are limited to hunke ring down, calling for help, and returning
fire as best they can when attacked. Make sure personnel know how to do those three
things effectively. Trainees should be able to answer the following seven questions when
trained: 1) What do I do first? 2) How do  I quickly determine th e source of attack? 3)
Where am I supposed to shoot? 4) What signals do I use? 5) How do I keep from shooting
friendly units coming to help us? 6) Who do I call for help and by what means? 7) What do
I do if receiving indirect fire? 
5.5.3.6.1.3.  Passive defense measures should include topics such as camouflage, resource
dispersal, expedient hardening, blackout procedures, etc. 
5.5.3.6.1.4.  It takes considerable training to perform security roles well, but there is only
limited category II training time available. Obviously, the time spent on security comes at
the expense of other training, so the better-trained personnel are the first time will decrease
the time required for refresher training. 
5.5.3.7.  Field Training Exercise (FTX). The annual field training is  an opportunity to devote all
time to contingency training. Rather than training on individual topics, it is a time to tie many of
them together. Each Airman assigned to the UTCs listed in AFI 10-210, Attachment 3, must par-
ticipate in a continuous 4 day FTX/bivouac once every 20 months (40 months for AFRC and ANG
units). Exceptions: (1) A MAJCOM Civil Engineer may reduce/waive this field training require-
ment for those UTC-tasked units not having 4 FPE* and 4F9E* UTCs assigned. (2) T o satisfy
unique ANG/AFRC requirements, the applicable  ANG/AFRC Civil Engineer may allow unit
commanders to divide the 4 day requirement into two sessions. If divided, only one session must
include a bivouac. However, units can elect to set up an encampment each session as needed. AFI
10-210 identifies the mandatory and optional items to include in the FTX. 
106
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
5.5.3.7.1.  The FTX mus t include command, control, and communications; CBRNE defense
actions; unit beddown; self aid/buddy care; and field sanitation. Unique combat skills training
such as individual and team movement techniques, troop leading procedures, land navigation
and map reading, weapons handling and qualification, convoy operations, work party security,
first aid firefighting and fire prevention, airb ase defense, and night operations must also be
incorporated into the FTX. 
5.5.3.7.2.  Additional training may include vehicle operations; personnel alert and recall pro-
cedures; deployment processing; equipment marshaling; pallet buildup procedures; hazardous
materials preparation training; camp layout; erection of available bare base assets; EOR; expe-
dient methods; appropriate multiskill training; plus any topic a unit wants to inject to make the
training more effective. When applicable, Mission Essential Equipment Training should also
be completed during the FTX. 
5.5.3.7.3.  Split the unit  up for field training if possible. Training will be better; less time
wasted, and more individuals will receive leadership experience. Place a different officer and
NCO in charge of each group and provide them the training objective. Make them responsible
for planning/conducting the training and arranging for support. 
5.5.3.7.4.  Allowance Standard 429 provides the Home Station Training Set used to conduct
the FTX. Consider joint training with services, security police, and other support forces. Their
participation adds realism and builds good working relationships. 
5.5.4.  Ancillary Training. All ancillary training can be taught separate ly, but some topics are easily
incorporated into category I and II training. E xplosive ordnance reconnaissance and self-aid and
buddy care are examples. This trai ning can easily be included in field training as well. Operations
Security (OPSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC) are classroom activities, but have a
“hands-on” application. 
5.5.5.  Installation Emergency Management Training. This important training currently covers the fol-
lowing courses: CBRNE Defense (Orientation, Awareness, Survival Skills, Functional Area Task
Qualification Training, and Key Leaders) Courses; Contamination Control Area Management and
Operations Course, Post-Attack Reconnaissance Course, Unit Control Center Operations Course,
Emergency Response Operations Course, Readin ess Support Team Course, Shelter Management
Team Course, Contamination Control Team Course, Exercise Evaluation Team Course, Unit EM Rep-
resentative Course, Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation, and Air Force Incident Management
Course. Civil engineers provide this training for the entire base. These courses are presented using
standardized lessons that are adjusted to meet local conditions and threats. See AFI 10-2501 for addi-
tional guidance. 
5.5.6.  Other Unit Training. There are other training requirements civil engineers should perform.
These tend to be base unique requirements that do not fit well into other categories. 
5.5.6.1.  Physical Fitness. Engin eers must be in good physical condition to handle the strenuous
tasks inherent in contingency operations. Good physical conditioning is important to CE readi-
ness. FES and EOD technicians have had a physical  conditioning program for years. In fact, the
FES program was the model for the Air Force. Physical conditioning is a personal responsibility,
but CE units can help by emphasizing the value of physical conditioning. One way is to conduct
weekly physical training sessions, as many units currently do. Consider asking the Services unit to
help develop a unit or individua l fitness program. Physical fitness is im portant in contingencies
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
107
and battle. A person can endure the stresses of battle better and long er—physically and men-
tally—when the body is fit. 
5.5.6.2.  Unit Orientation. Individuals should be oriented to the base during in-processing and the
first few weeks on the job; a number of topics should be covered. 
5.5.6.2.1.  Job Assignments and Responsibilities. Each individual needs and deserves to know
what tasks they could be asked to perform in a contingency or disaster. If an Airman has a spe-
cific job during a contingency, he or she needs to know what it is, what the responsibilities are,
and where to report. Everyone needs to practice or walk through his or her tasks at least once.
Do not forget the jobs that backup someone else. 
5.5.6.2.2.  Location of E quipment. Engineers need to know what equipment is available,
where it is located, and how to operate each item. They need to know how to get the equipment
and where to find the keys. 
5.5.6.2.3.  Location of Supplies. Show new personne l what supplies are available and where
they are located. Explain the procedures to get the materials. 
5.5.6.2.4.  Utility System Isolation Procedures. Utilities personnel need to know how to isolate
water and electrical systems. They need to know where main water shut off valves are located,
where circuits can be k illed, etc. They need to know any special safety considerations. This
information should be included in the CE Cont ingency Response Plan, but it must be passed
along and practiced. This information is often needed for day-to-day activities, but occasion-
ally one sees the knowledge residing with only one or two individuals. It will stay that way if
the knowledge is viewed as job security . Superintendents and element leaders must be
involved to overcome such a situation. 
5.5.6.2.5.  Priority Units. Some units on base, by the nature of their mission, enjoy a high pri-
ority and deserve more urgent attention when they call for CE  help. This knowledge is not
self-evident. Be sure all CE personnel understand which facilities get priority attention. 
5.5.6.2.6.  Recall Procedures. Brief individuals on recall procedures and explain their respon-
sibilities to contact others. 
5.5.6.2.7.  Alarm Signals. Individuals need to know what the local alarm signals mean and
what they should do when they hear a signal. This is especially true at overseas locations
where alarm signals and meanings can vary because of agreements with host nations. 
5.5.6.2.8.  The natural inclination is to assume base-unique training “automatically” takes
place. The shop foremen or NCOICs usually do it well. Make sure good base-unique training
occurs by encouraging each shop chief to incorporate contingency related requirements into
his or her newcomer’s orientation checklist. Checklists can be useful for orienting the more
senior individuals when they a rrive as well. Some orientation activities such as learning the
location of valves should be hands-on. This re duces problems such as finding a valve for the
first time at night with only a base utility map to help locate the valve. 
5.5.6.3.  OPLAN Reviews and Exerci se Preparation. Do not wait fo r base-wide exercises to see
how well the unit can respond to disas ters and contingencies. CE units should periodically run
their own OPLAN reviews and pre-exercise drills. These reviews and drills can be accomplished
to get the unit ready for a specif ic base-wide exercise or to make sure the unit is prepared for
108
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
actual contingencies. The emphasis should be on command, control, and communications—that is
where units tend to have the most problems. 
5.5.6.3.1.  Everyone who leads a res ponse team should be involved. This is their best chance
to learn what their teams may be called upon to perform. They can then decide what they must
do to get their teams ready . The number two person on each te am should also be involved.
Some might argue the experienced unit leaders who have been around for some time are wast-
ing their time—not true. Since they have “heard and seen it all before,” their insights can help
educate new personnel. 
5.5.6.3.2.  OPLAN reviews and ex ercise preparations can be conducted as briefings,
talk-through sessions, walk-through drills, command post exer cises (CPX), and full up unit
exercises. All have their advantages and all have essentially the same purpose: get Airmen
informed so they know how and when to res pond. Briefing the entire unit consumes a lot of
man-hours, but everyone hears the same message and it can minimize rumors. It can also be a
morale booster if done well, but the unit may want to reserve this for major inspections. These
sessions are good opportunities for the participan ts to “talk through” an OPLAN or exercise
and resolve support problems. Use the checklists for the plan being reviewed and find out if
they are adequate. When the session ends, the pa rticipants should understand what is to be
done, by whom, and in what sequence. Work out task timing and highlight critical support
requirements. Ask each leader to list what his or her team or shop must do to get ready, to set
the dates he or she plans to have all preparations complete, and to identify all limiting factors
and capability shortfalls. As individuals become more experienced, these sessions can be com-
pleted faster. 
5.5.6.3.3.  Sometimes, more than talk is needed. A walk-through, talk-through drill in the field
helps individuals see what they must do and what resources they have. With these drills, indi-
viduals actually step through the tasks in order. Speed is secondary to learning the what, who,
when, where, how, why, and in what sequence. A walk-through is helpful to train new person-
nel; to teach complex ta sks; to de-conflict activities that involve a lot of personnel whose
efforts could easily interfere with each other; to resolve timing problems; and to help person-
nel sitting in control center jobs to understa nd what happens in the field. A walk-through can
involve a few, or all leaders, or target specific crews or teams that may be having problems. 
5.5.6.3.4.  A unit CPX in the CE control center (or Damage Control Center) can help fix com-
mand and control problems without impacting the workforce. These sessions are beneficial to
get new personnel and augmentees familiar with facilities and their job in the control center. A
CPX allows participants to develop communi cation and COMSEC procedures, work out the
flow of information, and gain experience in  making base recovery and resource allocation
decisions in a hectic environm ent. Any other CE control locat ions can be added into these
exercises, such as the FES alarm room. 
5.5.6.3.5.  Conduct unit exercises when unit personnel know what to do but need practice to do
it well. Frequently, complex tasks must be repeated to get the timing right. A unit can waste a
lot of valuable time on exercises if personnel and leaders are not prepared. Use a combination
of these pre-exercise activities. For example, start with a talk through with the leaders. Have
walkthroughs with a selected team or teams. Then conduct a limited unit exercise. Very rarely
does every section and shop need to get involved. The exception might be for an ADR or base
recovery after attack practice at an overseas base. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
109
5.5.6.3.6.  Adequate exercise preparations will enable CE  leaders to answer the following
questions at a minimum: 
5.5.6.3.6.1.  What is supposed to happen? 
5.5.6.3.6.2.  What am I expected to do? 
5.5.6.3.6.3.  What resources—personnel and equipment—do I have to work with? 
5.5.6.3.6.4.  What do my teams and I have to do to get ready? 
5.5.6.3.6.5.  Who supports me? 
5.5.6.3.6.6.  Who is my boss? 
5.5.6.3.6.7.  How am I to communicate? By messenger, phone, radios? And with who? Are
there any codes? 
5.5.6.3.6.8.  Are there any special rules to follow? 
5.5.6.4.  Certification Training. Be aware that some CE specialties must be specially trained and
certified to perform certain tasks. This is especially true in FES, EOD, barr ier maintenance, and
utilities shops. Learn what tasks require certifi cation. For example, the unit does not want to
deploy to a bare base, install a mobile aircraft arresting system (MAAS), and find out that there is
no one qualified to certify that th e MAAS is ready to catch planes. Firefighters and others in the
unit must be certified on some  HAZMAT tasks. The best way to find out about certification
requirements is to ask each shop foreman. Share that information with all CE officers. 
5.5.6.5.  War Stories. Invite individuals that have b een on real-world deployments to relate their
experiences, share their lessons learned, identify the problems they encountered, and the solutions
they developed. “War stories” are an invaluable and interesting way to expose junior troops to the
potential problems they may encounter. Find the individuals in th e unit with interesting deploy-
ment experiences. Invite individuals from other base units that can offer different perspectives.
Experiences can be shared with the entire unit or targeted to the personnel in a shop or on a team. 
5.5.6.6.  CE Officer’s Call. A periodic gathering of the unit’s officers can be used to help prepare
them for their leadership responsibilities. Topics can come from daily e xperiences, home station
field training, or Prime BEEF deployments—alm ost any topic is valid. Successes and failures
should be highlighted. Getting individuals to talk about their fa ilures can be tough, but those are
often the most useful stories. Officer development should be the focus, but attendance does not
have to be limited to officers. Civilians, and especially senior NCOs, can contribute to and learn
from the discussions. Shop visits can be a good Officer’s Call activity. Periodically, have the offic-
ers visit a different shop. Each flight chief or shop foreman should give a tour and highlight shop
capabilities, limitations, and the biggest challenge he or she faces. Be sure to look at all utility sys-
tems. Also, visit the EOD, FES, and readiness fl ights. These visits help officers know who is in
charge of each flight or shop and help them to  understand the unique f eatures of their unit and
base. 
5.5.6.7.  Augmentee/Unit Integration Training. Augmentees, whether individuals or members of
Prime BEEF teams, require training to effectively support the unit. Readiness Support Team aug-
mentees are trained through the formal cours e presented in the installation EM training. Ideally ,
EOD augmentees get recurring training one to two days per month, but they can also get a cra sh
course when hostilities threaten. Prime BEEF, or other teams, that deploy to the base must get area
110
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
and base familiarization training. They may also require base-unique task training. Identify these
training needs in advance and acquire or develop lesson plans for them. Include training require-
ments and list responsibility for conducting that training in the contingency response plan. The
unit must determine the timing, content, and frequency of augmentee training. 
5.5.7.  Base Exercises. Civil engineers do not respond to disasters and contingencies alone, but as part
of a base team. To be effective, that team must periodically practice integrated responses to peacetime
disasters and wartime attacks through base wide exercises. Such exercises help engineers get familiar
with support they must provide to others, and highlight the support civil engineers need from others.
Engineers must be willing and cooperative players.  More information on base exercises and evalua-
tions will be covered in the next chapter. 
5.5.8.  Annual Training Schedule. To provide visibility and control to home station training, each unit
should prepare an annual expeditionary training schedule. It does not have to be complicated. The key
is to pick tasks that the unit most needs and has the resources to perform. Next, determine how much
time is needed to train each task and which ones can be grouped together. Identify prerequisite train-
ing for each task, because those must be scheduled first—then create the schedule. Some may argue
that with all the external demands on CE, a schedule cannot be kept. The counter argument is with all
the external demands; a schedule is needed to help meet all commitments. The schedule certainly can
be changed, but follow it as closel y as possible. This prevents having to go through all the work of
canceling and rescheduling support from others. 
5.6.  Silver Flag. The Silver Flag prog ram is essential to civil engine er readiness training. Many contin-
gency tasks simply cannot be trained at home station. For example, few bases have sufficient real estate,
mission flexibility, or equipment to explode holes repeatedly in the runway to allow the Prime BEEF team
to practice airfield damage repair. Neither do civil engineer units have mobile facilities and utility systems
to practice setting up a bare base. Silver Flag Exercise sites are free of many or all of those home station
constraints and resource limitations. 
5.6.1.  The program provides intensive, hands-on team training and certification for Prime BEEF
teams in traditional engineer skills, as well as in FES, EM and EOD skills. A number of core person-
nel on each Prime BEEF team train in special ta sks required to support air operations anytime, any-
where. These core personnel then lead and train their teammates during those contingency operations.
The team task certification is an important tool to demonstrate the training readiness of the mobile CE
force. 
5.6.2.  The curriculum focuses on preparing crews (versus individuals) to perform both beddown and
base recovery tasks. Trainees are grouped by functional area (technical specialty) into crews for spe-
cialized training, task evaluation, and certification. Most traine es participate in a multi-skill base
recovery or beddown exercise at the end of the trai ning period to allow students to see the “big pic-
ture” when beddown and base recovery activities require participation from many specialties. 
5.6.3.  During task evaluations, trainees must successfully perform the major tasks listed for their spe-
cialty. Because Silver Flag is important to Air Force Civil Engineer readiness, each Prime BEEF unit
records successful completion of Silver Flag training in its SORTS report. AFI 10-210 provides crite-
ria for MAJCOM Civil Engineers to grant CAT III training to units under specific circumstances. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
111
5.6.4.  Silver Flag activities depe nd on adequate home station prep aration. Those requirements are
detailed in a predeployment information package the training cadre sends to each unit weeks before
the unit deploys. 
5.6.5.  Silver Flag training is not intended to be a one-time effort. The inability to practice many con-
tingency tasks at home station dr ives the need for the core members of each Prime BEEF team to
return to the Silver Flag site at least once every AEF cycle. 
5.7.  Special Training Programs. There are other training opportunities to consider. 
5.7.1.  Regional Equipment Operator Training Site (REOTS). REOTS is operated by the Air National
Guard’s 201st RED HORSE Flight at Ft. Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, and provides an intensive
weeklong course of initial and re fresher training to CE heavy equi pment operators. Its purpose is to
elevate equipment operator proficiency on wartime tasks. The students train on four key airfield dam-
age repair vehicles: excavator, 4CY front-end loader, grader, and dozer. Active force 3E2X1 personnel
should attend the REOTS course shortly after attaining the 5-skill level. Reserve component personnel
must attend the REOTS course every 3 years. The course is available to active duty personnel as well
as Guard and Reserve engineers. Each unit must pay trainee travel and per diem. See the course details
in the AF Education and T raining Course Announcement located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil in
the HQ AFCESA section. Units request course quotas through respective MAJCOMs. 
5.7.2.  Expeditionary Combat Support-Training and Certification Center (ECS-TCC). The ECS-TCC
at Dobbins ARB GA has a certified cadre that administers contingency training to strengthen CE core
competencies. Task certification/re-certification, refresher, upgrade and just in time (in support of
contingency requirements) training is this site’s primary focus. Students receive individual hands-on
war and contingency skills training. The cadre in structs core and diamond task items from the
CFETPs on equipment and procedures not available at home station for 3-, 5-, and 7-level personnel,
and provides CAT III preparation for UTCs and individuals. The site has mission essential equipment
to include Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS), Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS),
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), and mission support equipment to include the
Contingency Airfield Marking System (paint striper), and Field Deployable Environmental Control
Units (FDECUs). Beddown and sustainment equipment training includes bare base facilities setup and
reconstitution, data collection and surveying using equipment and components from the Engineering
GIS package, and mobile hydraulic crane certification and training  up to a 50-ton capacity . The
ECS-TCC also partners with local fire departments and offers proficiency training in live fire applica-
tions, drivers training, and MAAS rewind operations. Note: EOD and REOTS training is not adminis-
tered at this site. 
5.7.3.  AETC Specialized Courses. AETC occasionally offers specialized courses that are tied to con-
tingency training. Quotas can be di fficult to get for these courses,  because CE competes for limited
funding with other Air Fo rce functional areas. Let the unit’s voice be heard when requesting quotas
from the MAJCOM. Just as with REOTS, course details are located in the ETCA. Examples are the
courses that cover bare base systems such as Bare Base Power Generation (Diesel), Bare Base Electri-
cal Systems, Bare Base Water Purification and Distribution System, and Bare Base Structures Erec-
tion course (this course can be delivered to the un it for just two course quot as making it a very cost
effective means to practically train the entire unit). 
5.7.4.  USAFE and PACAF Courses. HQ USAFE and HQ  PACAF offer theater specific versions of
the Silver Flag curriculum for theater CE units. This training is presented by the 38 Construction and
112
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Training Squadron at Ramstein AB, Germany, and by Det 1, 554 RED HORSE Silver Flag Exercise
Site at Kadena AB, Japan. The P ACAF site sends a mobile tr aining team to some of its bases to
present selected contingency lessons. Each MAJCOM schedules its units. 
5.8.  Ideas about CE Contingency Training. Some random but use ful ideas to help develop the training
program follow: 
5.8.1.  Pick training emphasis each year by deciding what capabilities are most important for the unit.
Make sure the unit can do  those things well and then work on eliminating weak points. If there are
many, decide which is most important and work it first. 
5.8.2.  Set training objectives for each lesson to in clude what must be done, what skills are needed,
and who should be trained. 
5.8.3.  There are not enough pe rsonnel in the Readiness and Emer gency Management Flight to plan
and conduct all required category II training. Use other individuals in the unit and select them early so
they have time to study their lessons. Consider dividing a Prime B EEF team into four to six groups.
Put an officer and senior NCO in charge of each group for contingency training. At the beginning of
the year, tell them what topics they need to cove r and give them an annual schedule. They are to be
totally responsible for planning and conducting th e training for their group and should arrange their
own logistical support. They can use experts to help present some of the lessons. They should use the
standardized Prime BEEF lesson plans provided by HQ AFCESA/CEXX. 
5.8.4.  Good instructor preparation is essential. The best instructors are the ones who are excited about
training. Occasionally ask the commander to visit a class for a short while—this gives a big boost to
the instructor and demonstrates to the class that the commander is serious about contingency training. 
5.8.5.  Train on the difficult things also, not just the easy stuff. 
5.8.6.  Training should build on previous lessons. 
5.8.7.  Timing tasks and complex tasks need more training, more frequently. 
5.8.8.  Train by shop when possible; it makes sense to  do so. This is more likely when tasks are
assigned to specific shops as discussed in Chapter 6. 
5.8.9.  Performance, not talk, is the measure of capability. Have personnel demonstrate how well they
can perform the job. Periodically and randomly ask individuals in the unit to explain their duties and
their shop’s mission in a particul ar contingency. If the individual cannot sufficiently convey the
responsibilities, advise their supervisor that the individual requires training. If this is common in one
shop, the supervisor is either not doing his or her job or needs training themselves. 
5.8.10.  Ensure that at least one expert is on the team for each contingency task. 
5.8.11.  Trainers should train their replacements. 
5.8.12.  To get the most out of Silver Flag training, ensure individuals complete prerequisite training
before deploying. 
5.9.  Summary. Training occurs on three levels: individual, unit, and integrated with other base units.
Training should be realistic and conducted as inte nded to fight. Having enough time and resources for
contingency training is a historical problem. When a threat is not imminent, training is less emphasized.
Yet, with a worldwide mobility commitment a nd peacetime disasters always possible, civil engineer s
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
113
must always be ready to respond. Often, the biggest obstacle comes from within the unit. How do individ-
uals in the unit view contingency training, as a chore or a challenge? If seen as distracting from the
day-to-day peacetime duties, training is probably considered a chore. If individuals focus on how to over-
come the shortages of equipment, time, and money, training is hopefully a challenge. Good training is an
attitude: it takes work to overcome the obstacles. Help the commander by outlining a good training pro-
gram, getting everyone involved, setting training objectives, and developing an annual training schedule.

Chapter 6  
EXERCISES, EVALUATIONS, AND INSPECTIONS 
6.1.  Introduction. Exercise, evaluations and inspections—though not popular —are an important part of
readiness and contingency response preparations. Exercises provide civil engineers with valuable oppor-
tunities to practice base-wide contingency responses and to train our personnel. Exercises enhance readi-
ness, improve crisis response, boost combat capability, streamline procedures, and help units master
OPLAN taskings. Evaluations and inspections provide  important feedback to units and commanders on
the adequacy of contingency planning, preparations, and training. The challenge is to intelligently use
exercises, evaluations and inspections to enhance CE capabilities. 
6.2.  Overview. This chapter outlines civil engineer involvement in exercises. It highlights the local exer-
cises engineers participate in and offers suggestions on planning unit activities. This chapter briefly dis-
cusses the joint service and MAJCOM exercises that CE teams may support. The chapter closes with a
discussion on local exercise evalua tions and offers tips for inspection preparation. While this chapter
focuses on base CE organizations and Prime BEEF units, RED HORSE units are major exercise players. 
6.3.  Civil Engineer Involvement. Civil engineers are routinely involved in exercises. Usually, local exer-
cises, but some engineers also have opportunities to participate in MAJCOM and joint service exercises.
The degree of involvement depends upon exercise objecti ves and scenarios. In local exercises, units can
usually dictate its level of ef fort by choosing to be a major player in  exercise planning. The more CE is
involved, the better the unit will be prepared to respond to crises. Unit attitude is important. A CE unit
gains the greatest benefit when its personnel enthusiastically participate in all aspects of an exercise, from
planning to final critique. It is no coincidence that in the best units the CE commander is actively involved
in the exercises, evaluations, and inspections. Where engineers look upon these activities as hindrances to
their “real job,” there is usually a problem. These activities also are not taken seriously when personnel
are under-involved and have a lot of “sit-around” time—they get bored. The unit can improve attitudes by
helping create realistic local exercises that involve all members. Since only limited number of civil engi-
neers have the opportunity to partic ipate in joint service or MAJCOM exercises, unit leaders must push
for engaged local exercises with maximum civil engineer involvement. 
6.4.  Local Exercises. Local exercises provide opportunities for trai ning and evaluation. They are con-
ducted more frequently than majo r off-base exercises, and the unit has more control over them. A FI
10-2501 directs the type, category, and frequency of exercises to be conducted. Functional publications
provide additional exercise requirements. Some exercise requirements that involve civil engineers are: 
6.4.1.  Major Accident Response  Exercise (MARE). Each of follo wing MARE scenarios are to be
conducted annually: a conventional munitions accident, a nuclear weapon accident if applicable to the
base, off-base response, mass casualty accident, HAZMAT response, radioactive material, and air
show response before an air show at the base. AFI 10-2501 and MAJCOM Supplements outline other
requirements. If the base has a HAZMAT team, it should be exercised at le ast annually IAW with
guidelines in AFMAN 32-4013. 
6.4.2.  Natural Disaster Response Exercise (or review). If the MAJCOM has identified the installation
as being subject to catastrophic natural disasters, conduct annual exercises of the type specified. Other
installations may conduct reviews. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008

6.4.3.  Terrorist Use of CBRNE. Conduct two CBRNE exercises annua lly, one must be a biological
incident. 
6.4.4.  Operational Readiness Exerci se (ORE). If in a low threat  area, conduct an annual CBRNE
exercise that reflects the most stringent CBRNE threats in place, or that ex peditionary forces could
face. In medium threat areas, conduct semi-annual CBRNE exercises, one of which may be a table top
exercise. In high threat areas, conduct CBRNE exercises quarterly, one during the year may be a table
top exercise. 
6.5.  Planning the Exercise (CE portion). The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight and CE exer-
cise evaluation team (EET) members work with th e local EET chief to plan civil engineer exercise
involvement. Push for realistic sc enarios with minimum simulation. Th e more realistic an exercise, the
greater its value as an evaluation and training tool. Be sure to receive the commander’s input as to what he
or she wants tested. Be ready to offer suggestions on what capabilities most need improvement and what
areas could benefit most from being exercised. 
6.5.1.  Set Objectives. When planning CE inputs, first determine or set objectives for the exercise. The
particular crisis or threat will dictate the basic thrust of the exercise. Also consider MAJCOM special
interest items, Inspector General (IG) findings from other units, and deficiencies noted from previous
exercises when setting exercise objectives. Do not overlook the common-core criteria detailed in AFI
90-201, Inspector General Activities. General information is also contained in AFI 10-204, Readiness
Exercises and After-Action Reporting Program. Obviously, the scenarios should test response capa-
bilities and evaluate response planning. Scenarios should also identify limiting factors (LIMFAC) and
evaluation of the following: 
6.5.1.1.  Recall procedures. 
6.5.1.2.  Command and control. 
6.5.1.3.  Crisis management; the ability to respond to the situation (recovery actions). 
6.5.1.4.  Predisaster actions. 
6.5.1.5.  Security (OPSEC and COMSEC). 
6.5.1.6.  Deployment processing. 
6.5.1.7.  Postdisaster recovery. 
6.5.2.  Requirements Vary. Exercise requirements vary with unit location and mission. 
6.5.2.1.  CONUS Bases. CONUS forces must be capable of responding to peacetime disasters and
emergencies. During wartime, they must also be capable of maintaining essential base functions.
For wartime simulations, exercise planners should assume that Prime BEEF teams are deployed
and that remaining forces and resources must sustain essential base functions. CONUS units
should exercise the civil engineer contingency response capability at least once each year using
only the non-mobile force. One possibility is to  conduct a recovery exer cise while the Prime
BEEF mobile teams receive their annual bivouac training. The need to pay civilian overtime and
to consider work conditions negotiated with a civil service union may limit options to have civil-
ian employees participate in these exercises. 
6.5.2.2.  Overseas Bases. In-place forces should also exercise and receive evaluation in peacetime
disaster responses as well as the traditional wartime tasks: EM operations; ADR; EOD; utility and
116
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
facility operations and maintenance; emergency repair of utilities and facilities; FES; debris
removal; base denial; and other personnel support. Some exercises should be held without the ben-
efit of locally hired civilian employees. Become familiar with Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)
and other rules governing local civilian labor participation in exercises. 
6.5.2.3.  Prime BEEF Teams. During wartime, civil engineers must be able to provide base and
facility support to satisfy mission requirements worldwide. These operations may be conducted in
a wide range of locations incl uding main, collocated, limited, standby, and bare bases. Prime
BEEF personnel will normally form a base civil engineer unit or augment an existing civil engi-
neer unit. Civil engineer support requirements for specific theater bases are normally documented
in In-Garrison Expeditionary Support or Joint Support Plans. When available, use such informa-
tion to enhance the exercises and evaluate the readiness capability of Prime BEEF mobility forces.
Evaluate Prime BEEF forces on mobility and deployment pla nning and execution, employment,
and redeployment. 
6.5.3.  Some Hints. Consider the following thoughts wh en planning civil engineer exercise involve-
ment: 
6.5.3.1.  Avoid the stereotyped or “canned” exercise—no two exercises should be the same and
vary the location. When exercising recovery res ponse, incorporate different problems and differ-
ent types of buildings and utility systems. 
6.5.3.2.  Be thorough when planning and designing s cenarios. Include as many shops as reason-
able in the exercise. 
6.5.3.3.  Build exercises as close to real-world scen arios as possible. Add details that help create
the stress and pressure experienced in actual situations. For example, provide a plethora of dam-
age input to the EOC and CE control center from many sources over a short period of time. Han-
dling a lot of both useful and extraneous information stresses control center personnel, but it also
gives them needed practice in sorting out what situations deserve priority attention. 
6.5.3.4.  Exercise when it is not convenient and under unique conditions. It may be a routine task
to conduct a recovery exercise under norma l circumstances; try it during non-duty hours with
phones out of commission or under radio-silence. 
6.5.3.5.  If civilian employees are to participate in exercises during non-duty hours, prepare to pay
overtime. 
6.5.3.6.  Be creative—setting up quality exercises can be exciting and create interest for unit per-
sonnel. 
6.5.4.  Implementing Realism. An example of one base implementing realism in an exercise went like
this—they operated for five days without commercial power, using only back up or standby genera-
tors. To add even more realism, the exercise was conducted while Prime BEEF teams were deployed.
Such an exercise has tremendous impact on the entire base. This is not an easy concept to sell to an
installation commander. Such an exercise does not have to last mu ch more than a day to gain major
benefits, but it is best done as part of a larger base exercise with all units participating. All personnel
learn their true dependence on CE-provided power. They get a realistic opport unity to identify their
wartime limitations and develop work -arounds—the same applies to ci vil engineers. This type of
exercise conveys realism and encourages enthusiastic participation by all civil engineers. The CE unit
risks an immediate demand for emer gency generators from every unit on base—that cannot reason-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
117
ably be satisfied. Due to  potential impact of such an exercise, the installation commander should
inform the MAJCOM in advance. 
6.6.  Higher Headquarters Exercises. Civil engineers o ccasionally have the opportunity to participate in
larger scale MAJCOM and joint serv ice exercises. These exercises offer a great chance to hone contin-
gency skills, both during the exercise and on exercise related construction. For these exercises, Prime
BEEF and RED HORSE teams will not likely be involved in the exercise planning. That planning will be
accomplished by the joint or MAJCOM engineers. CE teams often arrive first to beddown the exercise
participants and leave last after camp teardown. Exercises offer an opportunity to test mobile forces’ abil-
ity to meet time sensitive requirements. While these exercises usually last a week or more, they expose
civil engineers to tasks and equipment not used very often. BEAR equipment is frequently used and expe-
dient methods often required. This  provides the important benefit of offering Prime BEEF and RED
HORSE personnel the unique opportun ity for additional “hands-on” tr aining with this equipment under
simulated wartime conditions. The following paragraphs provide examples of major exercises civil engi-
neers support. 
6.6.1.  Exercise FOAL EAGLE, and Reception, S taging, Onward Movement & Integration Exercise
(RSO&I). These exercises test the ability of the US military to reinforce its forces in the Republic of
Korea in combined operations wi th South Korean forces. Prim e BEEF and RED HORSE personnel
are deployed to augment in-place civil engineer units to provide force beddown, operations and main-
tenance support, and base recovery capabilities. 
6.6.2.  Exercise BRIGHT STAR. This joint service exercise is conducted in Southwest Asia to evalu-
ate USCENTCOM capabilities. Some CE personnel are deployed to provide force beddown and base
operations and maintenance. 
6.6.3.  Exercise BRIM FROST. This joint service exercise is conducted in Alaska. The vast majority
of Air Force civil engineer support comes from personnel assigned to units in Alaska. However, sup-
port from CE units in the “lower 48” is encouraged. This exercise presents an excellent opportunity to
practice contingency skills in an extreme cold weather environment. 
6.6.4.  Exercise FUERTE CAMINOS (STRONG ROAD). This exercise has a humanitarian and civic
action focus versus the operational employment focus of the other exercises. It occurs in Central
America several times during the year, and provides engineers with an excellent opportunity to use
and learn expedient construction methods. 
6.6.5.  MAJCOM Exercises. Many exercises are planned and conducted each year by individual MAJ-
COMs such as ACC, PACAF, USAFE, and AMC. Seldom are units from ot her than the sponsoring
MAJCOM involved. 
6.7.  Benefits of Hosting Major Exercises. Hosting a major exercise can be taxing, but can be beneficial.
For example, exercise funds may be used to construct exercise facilities that the unit can use later for local
exercises. The construction provides valuable prac tice for CE teams. The MA JCOM or the joint com-
mand provides the exercise construction requirements, but the unit can certain ly identify needs and
attempt to develop mutually satisfying solutions. 
6.8.  Evaluations. An earlier paragraph mentioned the n eed to set exercise objectives. Each base has  an
exercise evaluation team to determine if exercise objectives are met. The installation commander appoints
the EET chief. Each unit commander designates individuals to serve on the team to evaluate its own func-
118
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
tional area. The evaluators need to  be experts in their field and we ll-trained. Exercises should not be an
“us against them” event for the EET members and they must avoid the temptation to nit-pick. The evalu-
ator’s role is to help the unit expose big problems and identify the reason for the problem. EET members
should also be alert to give credit where credit is due. 
6.8.1.  In conjunction wi th the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight, the CE evaluators
should develop checklists to aid in their evalua tions; a good place to start is AFI 90-201. It provides
common-core evaluation criteria for Prime BEEF, mobility, environmental, OPSEC, SORTS, and
self-defense of deployed units (self-defense applies to RED HORSE). The common-core criteria out-
line baseline tasks to be measured, desired combat readiness status, and rating criteria to use by Oper-
ational Readiness Inspection (ORI) teams. The common-core criteria emphasize performance versus
compliance. They are valuable tools when evalua ting civil engineer planning and execution during
contingency and disaster response exercises. Do not forget the guidance contained in MAJCOM sup-
plements to AFI 90-201. As with exercises , checklists should not be static —the first checklists will
not be perfect. As EET members learn, encourage them to update checklists. 
6.8.2.  Evaluations are worthless if identified problem s are not corrected. In after -exercise critiques,
designate who is to fix what problems. Establish a target date they can live with, and ensure everyone
understands they are to fix the problems. Then follow up personally or appoint a trusted individual to
make sure corrections are completed. Eliminate recurring deficiencies—the unit does not want
repeats, especially during inspections and assessments. 
6.9.  Inspections and Assessments. While official MAJCOM inspections and assessments cause great anx-
iety and are not enjoyable, use them to improve readiness and contingency response programs. Anticipate
what the inspectors will look for by looking at previous unit inspection reports and recent reports from
other units. Ensure the unit can perform the common-core tasks. Call counterparts at units just inspected
and get their personal perspective. During inspection preparation, the unit improves unit response capabil-
ities. 
6.10.  Summary. Training and exercising as a unit produces unit cohesion and combat capability. Training
alongside other functional and operational specialties develops integrated combat support. Exercises are
important tools to measure the effectiveness of civil engineer contingency planning and preparations.
Joint service exercises expose Prime BEEF teams to  major contingency tasks under actual deployed
(field) conditions. Unfortunately, few teams have the opportunity to participate. A MAJCOM operational
readiness inspection measures a unit’s capability to accomplish its wartime tasks, but these inspections are
not frequent enough to give commanders a steady flow of readiness information. Local exercises remain
the best way to give commanders adequate force readiness information and provide personnel with realis-
tic training. Use creativity, imagination, and realism when planning and conducting any exercise. Fol-
low-up to fix problems and deficiencies identified during exercises, evaluations, and inspections.

friendly forces or for his benefit. 
Base Recovery After Attack (BRAAT)—A theater concept of recovering a base after conventional
attack where resumption of flying operations is the first priority. Other recovery activities may be
conducted concurrently; however, these activities must not impede the resumption of flying operations. 
Biological Warfare—Often included in the general description of chemical warfare, biological warfare
involves the use of biological materials to incapacitate or k ill enemy forces. While banned by

material. They are primarily used to  protect parked aircraft; however, they can also be used for facility
hardening. 
Cannibalize—To remove serviceable parts from one item of equipment in order to install them on
another item of equipment. 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-yield Explosive (CBRNE)—An inclusive term
typically used to describe the threats and hazards associated with terrorist use of these type substances as
a weapon. 
Chemical Warfare—All aspects of military ope rations involving the employment of lethal and
incapacitating munitions/agents and the warning and protective measures associated with such offensive
operations. Since riot control agents and herbicides are not considered to be chemical war fare agents,
those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term “chemical,” which will be used to
include all types of chemical munitions and or agents collectively.

48 drills a year. (JP 1-02) 
Installation Operations Center—The top echelon of airbase defense operations and is led by the senior
Air Force commander. The primary focus of the installation operations center is flight operations, airbase
security and support to other forces on the airbase. The center’s battle staff includes senior officers from
the operations, maintenance, mission support, and medical groups. Members of the wing special staff or
senior officers representing major tenant units or host-nation forces may also be present. 
Host Nation Support—Civil and/or military assistance rendered by a nation to foreign forces within its
territory during peacetime, crisis or emergencies, or war based on agreements mutually concluded

installations, and maintenance stations. 
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System—A system that provides the foundation for
conventional command and control by national- and combatant command-level commanders and their
staffs. It is designed to satisfy their information needs in the conduc t of joint planning and operations.
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) includes joint operation planning policies,
procedures, and reporting structures supported by communications and automated data processing
systems. JOPES is used to mo nitor, plan, and execute mobiliz ation, deployment, employment,
sustainment, and redeployment activities associated with joint operations. (JP-1-02). 
Joint Support Plan—A plan for the reception and beddown of forces that is  collectively developed by
the host nation, the theater in-place sponsor, and the affected augmentation unit. The plan outlines all
facets of operations at a collocated operating base to include personnel, facilities, and equipment.

Operation—A military action or the carrying out of a strategic, operational, tactical, service, training or
administrative military mission. 
Operation plan—Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operation Plan, for the conduct of military
operations. Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response to requirements established by the
Chairman of the Joint Ch iefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to
requirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans either are prepared in a
complete format (OPLAN) or as a concept plan (CONPLAN). The CONPLAN can be published with or
without a time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) file. 
a.
OPLAN - An operation plan for th e conduct of joint operations that  can be used as a basis for
development of an operation order (OPORD). An
 OPLAN identifies the forces and supp
lies
required to execute the combatant co mmander’s strategic concept and a movement schedule of
these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD files.
OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the appropriate
annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as descri bed in the Joint Operation Planning and Execu-
tion System manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and formats. 
b. CONPLAN - An operational plan in an abbrev
iated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the com-
batant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary by the
combatant commander to complete planning. Ge nerally, detailed support requirements are not
calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. 
c.
CONPLAN with TPFDD - A CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except that it
requires more detailed planning for phased deployment of forces. 
Passive Defense—As used in this volume, me asures taken on or around an  installation to reduce the
probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action. 
Planning Factor—A multiplier used in  planning to estimate the amount a nd type of effort involved in a
contemplated operation. Planning factors are often expressed as rates, ratios, or lengths of time. From an
engineering perspective, planning factors are often expressed as lump sums or on a per-aircraft or per-per-
son basis. 
Potable Water—Water that is safe for consumption. 
Prime BEEF (Base Engineer Emergency Force)—A Headquarters US Air Force, major command and
base-level program that organizes civil engineer forces for worldwide direct and indirect combat support
132
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
or emergency recovery from natural disasters. It assigns civilian employees and military personnel to both
peacetime real property maintenance and wartime engineering functions. 
Readiness—The ability of US military forces to fight and meet the demands of the national military
strategy. Readiness is the synthesis of two distinct but interrelated levels: 
a.
Unit readiness – the ability to provide capabilities required by the combatant commanders to exe-
cute their assigned missions. This is derived from the ability of each unit to deliver the outputs for
which it was designed. 
b. Joint readiness – the combatant commander’s ability to integrate and synchronize ready combat
and support forces to execute his or her assigned missions. (JP 1-02). 
Readiness and Emergency Management Flight—The office of primary responsibility for all activities
and measures the installation designs or takes to prot ect Air Force resources from the effects of attacks,
natural disasters, and major accidents; to restore primary mission assets after disasters; and to fulfill the
humanitarian disaster relief responsibilities of commanders. 
RED HORSE—Squadrons established to provide the Air Fo rce with a highly mobile, self-suf ficient,
rapidly deployable civil engineering capability required in a potential theater of operations. 
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit—A water purification device that uses a series of
membranes to eliminate impurities. The ROWPU is capable of removing dissolved minerals. 
Sortie Generation—This term refers to all activities needed to get an aircraft ready to fly. It is used most
often in conjunction with fighter an d attack aircraft during periods of intense flying activity, when good
coordination of efforts is needed to prepare the maximum number of aircraft for flight in a short period of
time over a period of days. 
Subject to Deploy—Individuals whose Air Force specialty exists in any UTC or those assigned to a
federal civilian position designated as Emergency Essential. Subject-to-deploy personnel must be fully
trained and equipped on a time-available basis and as resources permit. 
Survivability—Concept which includes all aspects of protecting personnel, weapons, and supplies while
simultaneously deceiving the enemy. Survivability tactics include building a good defense; employing
frequent movement; using concealment, deception, and camouflage; and c onstructing fighting and
protective positions for both individuals and equipment. 
Tactical Deception—Activities designed to deceive, misinform and confuse an enemy concerning the
intent, disposition, or employment of friendly forces. Such actions may be accomplished by electronic,
visual, communication, and other methods. 
Terrorism—The calculated use of unlawful vi olence or threat of unlawfu l violence to inculcate fear;
intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or so cieties in the pursuit of goals that are generally
political, religious, or ideological. 
Time-Phased Force and Deployment List—Appendix 1 to Annex A of the operation plan. It identifies
types and/or actual units required to support the operational plan and indicates origin and ports of
debarkation or ocean area. It may also be generated as a computer listing from the time-phased force and
deployment data. 
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A Joint Chiefs of S taff developed and assigned code, consisting of five
characters that uniquely identify a “type unit.” 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
133
Wartime Construction Standards—Guidelines which determine the types of materials and construction
techniques to be used at various stages of a contingency or wartime situation. 
War and Mobilization Plan—The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. The
six volumes of the WMP extend through the Future Years Defense Program to provide continuity in short-
and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides current planni ng cycle policies and planning
factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations. It establishes requirements for development of
mobilization and production planning programs to s upport sustained contingency operations of the
programmed forces. The WMP encompasses all functi ons necessary to match facilities, manpower, and
materiel with planned wartime activity. 
War Reserve Materiel (WRM)—Materiel required in addition to primary operating stocks and mobility
equipment to attain the operational objectives in the scenarios authorized for sustainability planning in the
Defense Planning Guidance. Broad categori es are: consumables associated with sortie generation (to
include munitions, aircraft external fuel tanks, racks, adapters, and pylons); vehicles; 463L systems;
materiel handling equipment; aircraft engines; BE AR assets; individual clothing and equipment;
munitions and subsistence.

Attachment 2  
PREPARING CIVIL ENGINEER CONTINGENCY 
RESPONSE PLANS 
A2.1.  General Guidance. The basic sources of information for OPLAN preparation are AFI 10-401,
AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, and Headquarters Air Force Functional Area Managers. These sources per-
mit considerable latitude in format for plans other than MAJCOM OPLANs and concept plans (CON-
PLAN), which are written in support of joint serv ice plans. The CE Contingency Response Plan (CRP)
follows the basic format but varies to satisfy specific CE needs and to better support the CEMP 10-2. The
format also makes it easy to add annexes or appendi xes to support other plan taskings. The contingency
response plan does not replace CE input to other plans. Rather, it provides a convenient place to expand
upon those inputs and provide detailed CE-specific response instructions. Table 2.5. lists plans CE often
supports. Figure 2.1. shows where details to support those plans can be incorporated into the contingency
response plan. Some of those details are included in the examples in this attachment. 
A2.1.1.  The CRP contains a great deal of information in one convenient place to help civil engineers
make quick and sound decisions in contingency situations. The large volume of information dictates
that it be well organized to find needed information quickly. The ideal arrangement puts the most
important information at the fingertips. The suggested format in this attachment will organize the plan
in modules and then placed in binders, so all le vels of the organization can easily grab the book
required for each particular situation. The book designed for each shop, team, or control center posi-
tion need not have a complete CRP, but it should contain execution checklists (derived from the plan’s
operating instructions); a copy of the applicable operating instructions; required maps and schematics;
communication procedures, etc. 
A2.1.2.  Except for the annex letters and titles that  are specified in AFI 10- 211, the formats in this
attachment are guides only. If a more useful format for the base exists, use it and share it with others.
Send ideas to HQ AFCESA and indicate that they are for consideration in the next update to this pam-
phlet. 
A2.1.3.  The contingency re sponse plan should help the CE unit re spond to crises. Consequently, it
must contain response procedures and useful supporting information. It is very easy to include so
much information that the plan becomes arduous. Avoid this by starting with a clear idea of what to
include and what level of detail. Always review the plan in progress to ensure it stays within the game
plan. A plan does not need to cover every conceivable situation. It is a good plan if it clearly outlines
the following for major situations. 
A2.1.3.1.  Who is to respond? 
A2.1.3.2.  What resources they are to take. 
A2.1.3.3.  Where to obtain resources, including any special access requirements. 
A2.1.3.4.  Where they are to go first. 
A2.1.3.5.  What initial tasks they are to do 
A2.1.3.6.  Who is in charge? 
A2.1.3.7.  How they are to communicate with their boss. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
135
A2.1.3.8.  And how they will resupply. 
A2.1.4.  When a contin gency response plan is we ll researched and prepared, it will require few
changes over the years, only tweak s to change names and equipmen t status. If the plan has many
weaknesses, not all have to be co rrected at one time. Pick one anne x or appendix at a time and do a
thorough job with it. Once completed with one of the first three annexes (A, B, or C), the remaining
will be significantly easier. 
A2.1.5.  There are many ways to format a plan. Be consistent as possible, practical, and logical.
Attempt to place the same type information in the same relative place and use similar titles throughout
the different appendixes or tabs. For example, choos e to place communication procedures last in all
appendixes or tabs. Such consistency makes the plan user friendly. 
A2.2.  Plan Components. The components to an OPLAN submitted by a MAJCOM or NAF are normally
consists of a cover; a letter of transmittal; security instructions and record of changes; plan and planning
information releasability; a plan s ummary; a table of contents; the basic plan ; attachments; execution
checklists; and a distribution list. Include these components in the contingency response plan, but only
three are necessary: the table of contents, the basic plan, and the attachments (with their annexes, appen-
dixes, and tabs). These components are discussed in the following paragraphs. If the plan contains classi-
fied information, mark the plan according to the AFI 10-401, Volume 2, and add the security instructions
component. Refer to AFI 10-401, Volume 2, for guidance on the other co mponents. A cover is optional
for the CRP, but adds a finishing touch to a plan (Figure A2.1.). 
A2.3.  Table of Contents. Figure A2.2. presents a sample format for a table of contents. Suggest the devel-
opment of a draft or working table of contents early in  the plan preparation process. It serves as a useful
plan preparation guide and makes it easier for others to assist in plan development. 
A2.4.  Basic Plan. Format and guidance for the basic plan is included in Figure A2.3. This sample is writ-
ten as an unclassified plan. It is  recommended that the pl an be written as an unclassified document. If
classified material is required, incorporate that material into a classified annex that is printed and bound
separately from the basic document. 
A2.5.  Attachments (e.g., Annexes, Appendixes, and Tabs). There is no required format or content for
annexes, appendixes, or tabs. The following paragraphs offer some format and content suggestions. Fig-
ure A2.2. also highlights one way to organize the appendixes and tabs. The list of appendixes and tabs in
the figure is not intended to be comprehensive, tail or it as needed. Add, drop, or consolidate appendixes
to cover the situations at the base. Create tabs (operating instructions) to guide the response of each team
organized for each situation. Table 2.1. through Table 2.4. in Chapter 2 may trigger ideas for other
appendixes and tabs; use as few or as many appendixes and tabs as required. If an annex is not needed,
still list it in the table of contents with its corresponding letter, but mark it “Not Used.” Use locally defined
annexes U, V, and W if needed to include information that does not fit well into the other annexes. The
letters “I” and “O” are generally not used as labels for annexes or tabs to avoid confusion with the num-
bers one and zero. 
A2.6.  Annex A—Major Peacetime Accident. The recommended format for this annex is the same as the
basic plan, but this annex sh ould provide more detail on  major accident responses (Figure A2.4.). The
emphasis in the basic annex should be on the conditions which trigger a response, the major CE taskings,
136
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
and the command relationships. The appendixes and ta bs provide the specific details for CE response
teams. Likely accidents are covered in separate appendixes. The tabs to each appendix contain operating
instructions for control centers and for each flight, shop, or team that must respond, either initially or in a
support role. General information for the basic annex can be extracted from annex A of the CEMP 10-2,
especially from the CE appendixes. Rather than duplicate that information in two plans, write it in one and
cross-reference it in the other. If information is extracted from the CEMP 10-2 (or any other plan) and it
is rewritten often, the contingency response plan may have to be updated just as often. 
A2.6.1.  Appendixes to Annex A. Prepare an appendix for each majo r accident likely to occur on or
near the installation. Accidents that ca ll for the same initial response across the or ganization can be
consolidated into one appendix. While accident situat ions vary, the initial response will generally be
similar. At least three appendixe s will be needed: one for on-ba se accidents, one for of f-base
responses, and one for hazardous material (HAZMAT) spills. Accidents involving nuclear materials
may trigger the need for another appendix; follow the CEMP 10-2 direction. See Figure A2.5. for the
suggested format. 
A2.6.2.  Tabs to Appendixes in Annex A. Create tabs to provide specific instructions for the response
of each flight, shop, team, and control center. Recommend that tabs be formatted as operating instruc-
tions as in Figure A2.6. CE control centers, flights, shops, and teams should develop execution check-
lists from their operating instructions (tabs). Checklists are not part of the plan. 
A2.6.3.  Common Appendixes and Tabs. When guidance applies to all teams, a common appendix or
tab can be written. A common tab is useful when there is a large amount of identical information and
when not wanting to duplicate it in all tabs. Unit recall and assembly procedures and communication
procedures are two examples. Special notifica tion and communication requirements should still be
included in individual appendixes and tabs. If common appendixes and tabs are chosen, recommend
using that format throughout the plan. 
A2.7.  Annex B—Natural Disaster. Tailor the basic formats to present the information required in this
annex and its appendixes and tabs. Write an appendix for each “likely” natural disaster such as hurricane,
tornado, wild fire, flood, etc. Where responses differ from those of an accident, write different operating
instructions for each appendix. When responses are essentially the same, refer to a previous tab. Be sure
to cover CE predisaster, dispersal, and evacuation actions. Also, address CE actions to provide temporary
shelter for disaster victims. See Figure A2.2. for ideas about appendixes in this annex. 
A2.8.  Annex C—Enemy Attack. The instructions for annex B also apply to this annex, except the appen-
dixes will reflect wartime activities. Figure A2.2. offers ideas on other appendixes and tabs for this annex.
Content suggestions for some of the appendixes follow. 
A2.8.1.  Appendix 1—Notification, Recall, and Assembly. Outline procedures used to notify the unit
of its need to resp ond. Describe instructions and assign responsibility to initiate unit recall. Cover
individual responsibilities when notified to return to duty: recall responsibilities, what personal gear to
bring, when and where to report, etc. Include notif ication, recall, and assembly instructions for each
type of response. When the instructions apply to more than one situation, cross-reference rather than
repeat the same instructions. 
A2.8.2.  Appendix 2—Base Reception Plan Support. Present the CE tasks and detailed instructions to
beddown forces that augment the base, or temporarily accommodate forces flowing through during
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
137
war. Also, cover all CE support to temporarily shelter non-combatant evacuees. Outline tasks by pri-
ority order and indicate who will do each. Include a schedule showing when tasks must be completed. 
A2.8.3.  Appendix 3—Expedient Hardening. Provide instructions for the expedient hardening tasks
that CE must perform and for required support to other units engaged in hardening their own facilities
and equipment. List the facilities involved, indicate what is to be done, by whom, and when. 
A2.8.4.  Appendix 4—Resource Dispersal. Identify resources to be disp ersed, how they will be
moved, who will do it, where they will go, and when. Also, identify any site preparation required for
the locations where teams disperse as well as equipment and materi als they should take to prepare
those sites. Include classified information in annex X. 
A2.8.5.  Appendix 5—Non-Combatant Evacuation. If not included in the Base Reception Plan Sup-
port appendix, be sure to include CE support in some appendix. Since this is a base wide effort, show
CE interface and timing. 
A2.8.6.  Appendix 6—Casualty Care. Following base procedures, explain what the unit and individual
members are to do with casualties—both the wounded and the dead. Some details may not be able to
be included, such as locations of casualty collection points, because that information may not be avail-
able until just before hostilities be gin or after an attack. The fact that casualties should be taken to
those locations can be noted in this appendix as well as requirements to notify team chiefs or supervi-
sors. 
A2.8.7.  Appendix 7—Base Recovery After Attack Ac tions. While the type, intensity, extent, and
duration of an attack cannot be known, this appendix and its tabs can provide the details for the initial
CE response to a base attack. Th e details between an overseas and a CONUS base will naturally be
considerably different. The example in Figure A2.2. outlines the situation at an overseas base. 
A2.8.8.  Appendix 8—Vehicle and Limited Area Contamination Control. Show how vehicles and lim-
ited areas (mission essential equipment, and command post entry points) can be decontaminated dur-
ing peacetime chemical accidents or wartime CBRNE operations. Include a list of vehicles,
equipment, and personnel used in decontamination operations. 
A2.8.9.  Appendix 9—Survival, Reconstitution, and Recovery. If the base has a SRR tasking, include
CE support actions in an appendix. As with all responses, identify what is to be done, by whom, with
what resources, by when, and where. 
A2.8.10.  Appendix 10—Security and Bas e Defense. Show how CE personn el designated to bear
arms are to be used during contingencies and wartime operations. This requires direction from secu-
rity forces. If they do not plan to use CE personnel, state that. Plans must contain provisions for com-
mand and control with emphasis on fire control. Include an indication of when CE personnel might be
called on to help, such as a specific DEFCON or FPCON or a specific situation. Usually this will be
included only at overseas bases. 
A2.8.11.  Appendix 11—Weapons and Ammunition Management. Civil engineer forces assigned or
subject to performing recovery operations in a hostile environment should be armed, weapons-trained,
and qualified to bear arms. In ge neral, the management of weapon s assigned to any civil engineer
organization is a shared responsibility between the commander, the readiness flight chief, a deploying
Prime BEEF team chief, and the individuals receiving the weapons. This appendix must address the
management of the weapons authorized for use by Air Force engineers. Rather than a separate appen-
138
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
dix, this information can be included as a tab (opera ting instruction) in the security and base defense
appendix. Instructions relating to deployment preparations can be included in Annex F. 
A2.8.11.1.  Address the accountability and mainte nance of all weapons assigned to the or ganiza-
tion. The intent is to ensure that weapons and ammunition are controlled and that security proce-
dures are followed when weapons are in storage or when they are issued to individuals. Stipulate
the security procedures to follow when weap ons are issued to ensure positive control is main-
tained at all times. 
A2.8.11.2.  Address storage of weapons and ammunition in garrisons and under field conditions.
The instructions should spell out procedures used to protect the firearms as well as the method of
sounding an alarm if a forceful theft is attempted. An armed re sponse force must be reas onably
available to protect the weapons. 
A2.8.11.3.  Also, address the movement of weapons. This includes the preparation, storage, mar-
shalling, issue, courier, and safeguarding of small arms and a mmunition deployed in support of
contingency operations. 
A2.8.12.  Appendix 12—Base Denial. CONUS bases do not requi re this annex. Engineers are well
qualified to execute denial operations with hea vy equipment and demolitions, but other units must
also be involved in denying their facilities and equipment. This annex must provide detailed instruc-
tions for carrying out CE denial tasks. When selecting facilities and equipment for denial, planners
must consider national policy restrictions, if any, of the US or hos t nation. Coordinate, as required,
with other functional areas, US elements, joint commands, and allied forces. Generally, these consid-
erations should be covered in the installation deni al plan. Theater commanders establish the policies
governing denial operations in the theater, and delegate base-specific denial planning and execution to
the lower level command. As a minimum: 
A2.8.12.1.  State conditions for base denial when possible. 
A2.8.12.2.  List the commanders having local denial authority. 
A2.8.12.3.  List specific facilities, utilities, equipment, and supplies to deny. Indicate the method
and degree of denial. Assign those “targets” to specific denial crews for execution. Identify discre-
tionary targets and the conditions in which they would be denied. Also, identify any prohibited tar-
gets, such as facilities which must  not be damaged, because they  have historical or cultural
significance. Evacuation of equipment and materials is as much a part of denial operations as
destruction and should always be considered first. 
A2.8.12.4.  List the priority for destruction or evacuation. Delineate the time phasing of denial.
The amount of time available can affect the order in which items are denied. With little time, the
higher priority facilities will likely be denied first. With additional time and an uncertain situation,
the higher priority facilities may be saved until the last. 
A2.8.12.5.  For evacuation, specify what items will be moved, on what vehicles, and by whom. 
A2.8.12.6.  Describe availability of special civil engineer denial teams (such as RED HORSE
demolition teams). 
A2.8.12.7.  Outline limitations on destructive denial. 
A2.8.12.8.  Describe safety and security measures to be followed. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
139
A2.8.12.9.  Describe how denial resources, from bot h on-base and off-base sources, will be allo-
cated. 
A2.8.12.10.  Include instructions for removal or destruction of classified materials and documents. 
A2.8.13.  Appendix 13—Minimum Alert Preparations. There will al ways be a need to outline the
most important actions to get ready for war with minimum notice. Consider including minimum alert
preparations in each individual annex, appendix, and tab. Consolidate them in one appendix or include
them in annex X, if classified. Because of the time sensitivity, be sure to list the tasks in priority order;
identify who will do them; state what resources will be available, priorities for use of equipment; and
specify when they should be completed. 
A2.8.14.  Appendix 14—Facility Operations and Maintenance with Limited Manpower. Identify what
facility operations and maintenance tasks will be performed when not all members of the CE unit are
available. This includes operation of utility and HVAC systems. Two scenarios come to mind: Prime
BEEF teams have deployed or the civilian workforce is unavailable for any reason at bases in foreign
countries. Cover each scenario as appropriate for the base. 
A2.8.15.  Appendix 15—Operations Security (OPSEC). Civil engineers must always be sensitive to
operations security. Describe procedures to minimize transmission by non-secure radios, phones,
computers, messages, etc., of information about base status and uni t capabilities. The status of most
tasks covered in this annex is OPSEC sensitive. 
A2.8.16.  Appendix 16—Communication Procedures. If not covered elsewhere, include a communi-
cations appendix. Be sure to cover the allocation of equipment, communication procedures and prior-
ities, call signs, authentication codes, etc. Classified information should be included in annex X. 
A2.9.  Annex D—Terrorist Attack. Response to terrorist use of CBRNE requires many of the same
response actions as other types of incidents; however, responders must also establish and maintain a chain
of custody for evidence preservation as directed by the IC. Responders must be alert for physical indica-
tors and other outward warning signs of additional CBRNE events, including armed assault. Also, they
must consider the potential for secondary attack, such as chemical dispersal devices, secondary explosive
devices or booby traps.. 
A2.10.  CE Support for Miscellaneous Plans/Situations. This annex permits the plan to include CE sup-
port for situations that are peculiar to a base or do not logically fit into annexes A, B, or C. It is suggested
to prepare an appendix with tabs for each of thos e plans or situations. G ood examples include a bomb
threat, the Stop Alert Plan, mortuary support, and the Installation Secu rity Plan (or Resource Protection
Plan). Joint Support Plans require certain actions to be taken by ove rseas USAF support bases when the
plans are implemented. If the unit has such taskings, include them in this annex. Provisions to protect real
property records and engineering record drawings from damage can be included here or in annexes B and
C to tie them to a specific crisis. 
A2.11.  Annex E—Fire Emergency Services Operations. Describe ARFF structural firefighting, contain-
ment, other emergency services, and response actions to be taken during attack , natural disaster, major
accidents, major fire incidents (as prescribed by AFIs 32-2001, 10-2501 and 10-210), and local operations
plans. Emphasis should be on the to tal unit response and support for firefighting operations. “Normal”
emergency responses and firefighting operations need not be included if they are covered by pre-fire
plans. Include the following elements: 
140
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
A2.11.1.  FES vehicles and quantities of fire suppression agents available on base. 
A2.11.2.  Emergency off-base responses, including predesignated firefighting vehicles with their
un-refueled on-road travel distances. Include logistics support requirements. 
A2.11.3.  Procedures to provide fire emergency services for nearby federal facilities if municipal
employee strikes or slowdowns inhibit normal municipal fire suppression services. 
A2.11.4.  Conflagration hazards and natural cover fires. 
A2.11.5.  Alternate water sources. 
A2.11.6.  Vehicle resupply procedures (agent, water, and fuel), procurement of additional firefighting
agent supplies, and the availability of personnel from other than the FES organization. 
A2.11.7.  Specific responsibilities of other organizations to support FES operations, types of equip-
ment available by support agencies, and response procedures. This includes auxiliary firefighting. 
A2.11.8.  Reciprocal/mutual aid agreements for fire protection en tered into by Air Force installation
FES with other fire organizations. These agreements ensure adequate manpower and equipment are
available to cope with major fire incidents and disaster situations that exceed the capability of the Air
Force installation FES. The agreements should be  summarized or the actual agreements included in
annex M. 
A2.11.9.  Confined space rescue. Include procedures and support requirements for confined space res-
cue. Cover situations where the FES flight traditionally acts independently (such as rescues from  a
POL tank, an on-aircraft fuel cell, or a burning building) and situations that require an integrated effort
by the disaster response force (such as a collapsed building rescue). 
A2.12.  Annex F—Deployment Preparations. As needed, include appendixes and tabs to define all actions
required to prepare the Prime BEEF  teams for deployment once they ar e alerted. Provide details for CE
tasks outlined in the base deployment plan. Assign responsibi lities to specific crews and identify when
each task must be completed. Suggest the preparation of operating instructions for mobilizing the teams;
preparing, marshalling, and transporting equipment and weapons; and if required, convoying the team to
its port of embarkation. This annex should not duplicate information in the base deployment plan. 
A2.13.  Annex G—Contingency Environmental Considerations. Include instructions for environmental
protection that are unique to contingencies or are so important that they need to be emphasized. By way
of example, contractors dispose of toxic wastes for most bases. In war, contract disposal may not be pos-
sible. Identify procedures to temp orarily store or permanently dispos e of toxic materials when the unit
cannot get access to an approved disposal location. If materials are to be buried, identify those sites in
advance and determine what methods and materials that will be used to control runoff and leaching into
the ground. Non-standard pollution prevention and clean-up procedures should be addressed. Address
procedures to protect on-base water supplies from HAZMAT spills and indirect runoff. 
A2.14.  Annex H—Facility Priority Listing. List the priority of installation facilities in their importance to
the installation mission. The list indicates which facilities get priority attention for actions such as expedi-
ent hardening, firefighting, damage recovery, or utilities isolation (in reverse order). The list should be
used as a guide, not  a hard, fast plan, since unfore seen circumstances can easily dictate deviations. In
those situations, common sense and good judgment must prevail. Figure A2.9. illustrates a sample for-
mat. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
141
A2.15.  Annex J—CE Personnel Shelters. Provide instructions for sheltering civil engineers before, dur-
ing, and after disasters and war. List the personnel shelters that civil engineers will occupy or manage.
Extract that information from the base  shelter listing or incorporate that list in its entirety. For each CE
shelter, include capacity; the kind of shelter (CBRNE, tornado, flood, etc.); who owns and operates it and
who else uses it; how long it should be prepared for occupancy; what utilities it has (heat, power, backup
power, communications, etc.); protection factor and date of last survey if a nuclear shelter. Identify which
part of the facility is to be used for shelter space if not the entire building. Include shelter preparation and
operating instructions for CE shelter management teams. Provide shelter assignment instructions for CE
shops/teams. Follow MAJCOM guidance if more specific. 
A2.16.  Annex K—Personnel Augmentation. This annex covers where additional personnel—both skilled
and unskilled—are to be obtained. This includes Prime BEEF team s, contractors, reserve backfills, base
augmentees, etc. 
A2.16.1.  Appendix 1—Base Augmentees. List augmentee requirements from the base Augmentation
Duty program and highlight their duties and responsibilities and who in CE is responsible for each
group. 
A2.16.2.  Appendix 2—Integration of Deployed Teams. Provide instructions for integrating Prime
BEEF and other teams that are deployed to assist the unit. Identify facilities, space, vehicles, equip-
ment, and communications equipment that will be provided to those teams. Outline the command and
control arrangements and likely tasks the teams will complete. Suggest the inclusion of an outline for
the in-brief or written information the unit shoul d present to the arriving team and its commander/
chief. Provide a situation brief, the information contained in th is appendix, administrative and logis-
tics support procedures, natural hazards in the area, and special safety concerns. 
A2.16.3.  Appendix 3—Civilian Contractor Capability and Unskilled Labor in the Area. Include the
following information in this appendix: 
A2.16.3.1.  Available contractors by name, address, phone number, point of contact, and special-
ties. 
A2.16.3.2.  Contact points for obtaining unskilled laborers. 
A2.16.3.3.  Any restraints that would preclude using local civilians. 
A2.16.4.  Appendix 4—CONUS Sustainment Backfill Requirements. At some CONUS bases, reserve
personnel backfill deployed Prime BEEF positions and provide essential facility operation and main-
tenance during war. List those requirements and plan to efficiently receive and employ backfill per-
sonnel. 
A2.16.5.  Appendix 5—Availability of Other Military Forces. List US military engineer forces (espe-
cially reserve and guard un its) on or near the base that could rapidly backfill essential positions.
Include the name, phone number, and address of the point of contact. These units have their own war-
time taskings, so they may only be available in peacetime. 
A2.17.  Annex L—Equipment and Supplies. This annex provides a su mmary of required and on-hand
civil engineer equipment, vehicles, and supplies. It outlin es possible sources for those items if not
on-hand. 
A2.17.1.  Appendix 1—Equipment under Direct Air Force Control. Include this information: 
142
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
A2.17.1.1.  General purpose, construction, and debris cleanup vehicles and support equipment
required for contingency operations; list by type and quantity available. If the equipment is not
under CE control, note its location along with the contact point for authorizing CE use. 
A2.17.1.2.  Equipment and vehicle disp ersal procedures if not already included in Annex C. For
peacetime dispersal at all bases and wartime disp ersal at CONUS bases, include site location,
vehicle restrictions, dispersal notification, support available at the site, etc. Kits enabling contin-
gency response crews to survive and operate at each dispersed site should be identified in this
appendix. Give copies of the OIs to each team leader involved, and place one copy in Annex L. 
A2.17.1.3.  Handwritten changes can be  made to the copies of the plans in the EOC, CE control
center/DCC, and the master plan in lieu of retyping and reprinting and distributing a new appen-
dix. 
A2.17.1.4.  The suggested headings for this appendix is illustrated below: 
A2.17.2.  Appendix 2—Equipment to be Acquired from Nearby Civilian or Military Sources, or Other
State and Federal Agencies. Sources, types of agreement, types of vehicles/equipment available, and
points of contact (including name, address, and phone number) should be listed. If mutual aid agree-
ments have been made, include a copy of the document in annex M.  Use the format in paragraph
A3.16.1. To speed the paper work, include completed sample AF Form 9s except for the quantity of an
item needed. Identify the fund citation to be used on the Form 9. 
A2.17.3.  Appendix 3—Construction Material Stockpiles. List construction materials stockpiled by
type and quantity. Contact points to release materials should be noted if materials are not under direct
BCE control. Use or modify the sample format in Appendix 1, but  also include the NSN in the
requirement line for each item. 
A2.17.4.  Appendix 4—Off-Base Sources of Basic Materials for Cont ingency Response Operations.
Sources, contact points, and types of materials available should be listed. If reciprocal aid support
agreements have been made, include a summary or a copy in Annex M. The recommended headings
is illustrated below. 
A2.17.5.  Appendix 5—Prepositioned WRM. List prepositioned WRM that can be used in a contin-
gency. Specify the location of the items—items may be stored at another base. Describe procedures
for getting authorization to use the items and access to them. 
A2.18.  Annex M—Support Agreements and Contracts. Include a summary or copy of all support agree-
ments that apply to contingency response activities. This includes formal mutual aid agreements, host ten-
ant support agreements, interdepartmental support agreements, inter-service support agreements, host
nation support, and informal agreements. The summaries should include the organizations involved in the
agreement; a brief description of th e specific support to be  provided; the conditions and procedures for

requesting support; and the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the points of contact. The most com-
mon for civil engineers are agreements for EOD and FES support. 
A2.19.  Annex N—Base Utility Systems and Waste Disposal. This annex should outline the layout and
operation of the base utility systems, show how the systems can be isolated and protected, and explain
backup measures. It should also describe unusual operating procedures required for special situations. It
also covers procedures for disposal of garbage, solid wastes, and toxic wastes (if not covered in Annex G). 
A2.19.1.  Appendix 1—Electrical Power Supply/Distribution System. Describe the power supply and
distribution system. Include primary and secondary voltages, circ uit and substation locations, and
source of power. Include record drawings and single-line diagrams of prime and emergency electrical
systems; also include switch and circuit breaker positions. Identify areas that can be isolated from the
main system. Note the number and location of other record drawings. Identify the point of contact for
the local power company. Identify circuit or system components subject to frequent problems, as these
tend to be the first to fail. 
A2.19.2.  Appendix 2—Alternate/Emergency Power Sources. Describe alternate primary power
sources including connection locations, voltages, kilo-volt-amps, kilowatts (kW), and other details.
List emergency generators, and floodlight sets by location and de scription. Show priority and

cedures and schedule for refueling generators. Identify which emergency generators can assume the
load directly and which units can be operated in parallel with the normal source. Describe the proce-
dures for the base to handle an extended 30-day electrical power outage. Note mission critical facili-
ties that require stable (conditioned) three-phase power. The suggested headings for listing equipment
follows: 
A2.19.3.  Appendix 3—Electrical Demand Reduction Plan/Utility Isolation. Include a demand reduc-
tion plan, in increments of appr oximately 10 percent of the normal maximum demand, to the mini-
mum necessary to operate without degrading the essential base miss ions. Describe specific steps
required to achieve each level of reduction. Outline procedures to isolate sections of the base and, if
required, provide power to critical facilities in that area.

A2.19.5.  Appendix 5—Alternate/Emergency Water Supply. Describe alternate or emergency potable
and non-potable water sources on or near the base; include quantities available and describe the means
for obtaining the water. Find a non potable water source that can be used exclusively for firefighting.
Identify emergency water distribution points that can be used when water is hauled to the base. If con-
sidered necessary, include procedures for controlling access to the water under such conditions to
avoid chaos. This may require security police assistance to control crowds. A steady supply of water
will eliminate panic. 
A2.19.6.  Appendix 6—Water Demand Reduction Plan/Utility Isolation. As with the electrical sys-
tem, include a demand reduction plan, in increments of approximately 10 percent of the normal max-
imum demand, to the minimum necessa ry to operate without degrading the essential base missions.
Describe specific steps required to achieve each level of reduction. Outline procedures to isolate sec-
tions of the base and, if required, provide water to critical facilities in that area. 
A2.19.7.  Appendix 7—POL Supply, Storage, Distribution, and Emergency Backup. Describe the var-
ious POL systems, including storage capacity, location of tanks and distribution system, and source of
emergency stocks; list record drawings by number and location. Include a complete gas distribution
system map and a list identifying each building and its gas loads in the order in which gas service
should be shut off. USAFE bases should include the point of contact and describe the repair capabili-
ties of NATO pipeline crews. Describe the locations of primary and backup gasoline and diesel fuel
(JP8) sources required for operating BCE emergency vehicles and backup generators. 
A2.19.8.  Appendix 8—Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVACR) Systems.
Describe the heating plant system(s) and the heating distributio n system(s) in general terms; fuel
types, storage capacities, and consumption rates must be included. Identify subsystems that can be
segregated from the main system. Include refueling responsibilities and procedures; list record draw-
ings by number and location. Identify HVACR systems that provide essential support to critical mis-
sion facilities. Describe each system, location of spare parts, and backup options. 
A2.19.9.  Appendix 9—Gas System. Describe the base gas distribution system. Identify the supply
points and location, type and size of gas lines; list record drawings. 
A2.19.10.  Appendix 10—Airfield Lighting. Show layout of the airfield lighting system and describe
its operation. Provide details on components, control system, and backup power. List the quantity and
location of repair materials and backup capability. Cover procedures for laying out alternate systems. 
A2.19.11.  Appendix 11—Sewage Collection/Disposal System. Describe the sewage collection and
disposal system. Also describe a lternate or emergency waste disposal methods; list record drawings
by number and location. 
A2.19.12.  Appendix 12—Solid Waste Disposal. Explain current procedures and identify disposal
contractor’s point of contact. Detail emergency procedures and assign responsibility for disposing of
solid waste and garbage. This may require users to participate by taking their waste to a central loca-
tion. There is no one good solution for all bases. 
A2.19.13.  Appendix 13—Toxic Waste Disposal. Describe current method of toxic waste disposal and
identify the point of contact for current disposal contractors. Explain emergency disposal procedures
and assign responsibility for accomplishment. 
A2.20.  Annex P—Airfield Pavements. Describe all airfield pavements by location and type; attach a
drawing of airfield pavements. Id entify all pavements that may be used as emergency runways or are
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008

capable of use by assigned or deployed aircraft. Identify pavement that can be used as alternate taxiways.
Show locations of ADR patch components, FOD covers, and associated crater and spall repair materials
and equipment. List other methods of repairs, such as local brands of cold or hot mix; list materials that
are available on base to affect repairs. For materials that are not available on base, list sources of off-base
supply. 
A2.21.  Annex Q—Climatic and Geologic Factors. Describe in general terms the climatic factors such as
rainfall, snowfall, temperature ranges, potential wind storms, and other factors that can affect contingency
operations. Also, include geographic factors, such as tides and elevations that can affect contingency
operations. 
A2.22.  Annex R—Damage and Reimbursable Cost Docume ntation. This annex should outline proce-
dures for documenting damage to base facilities, utilities, and pavements. Photographic documentation is
often the most useful immediately following the cris is. Outline the local procedures for getting photo-
graphic support. The annex should cover CE support to the base legal office to document damage to civil-
ian property as a result of an Air Force incident and to estimate the costs of repair or replacement. The
annex should also outline provisions for capturing labor, equipment, and material costs in support of reim-
bursable activities. Approved Air Force support to civil authorities following a disaster is one example
when this might be done. Open a collection work order for each incident. 
A2.23.  Annex S—Maps and Charts. List the base requirements for maps and charts to support contin-
gency operations. Include instructions and an example showing how to read the base grid map. 
A2.24.  Annex T—EOD Operations. Describe the procedures the EOD flight will use to assess, clear, and
dispose of unexploded ordnances. 
A2.25.  Annexes U, V, and W. These are optional annexes that can be locally defined to incorporate infor-
mation or instructions which do not logically fit into other annexes. 
A2.26.  Annex X—Classified Annex. Since the vast majority of the information in this plan is unclassi-
fied, use a separately published cl assified annex to provide classifi ed guidance and information without
having to classify the entire plan. This annex can also  incorporate CE-specific actions in support of the
wing Emergency Action Procedures. 
A2.27.  Annex Z—Distribution. List the organization and number of copies each will receive. Include
base agencies, the MAJCOM and all flights, sections, and shops within CE as needed.

A3.1.  Introduction. A contingency plan is a set of procedures prepared in advance to respond to specific
or various contingencies a base and unit may face. A good plan is tailored to the base’s and unit’s specific
situation (e.g., Ellsworth AFB, Sout h Dakota, does not need to plan for hurricanes or tidal waves). By
anticipating problems and planning for them, the base and unit can rapidly mobilize the technical, finan-
cial, administrative and engineering resources needed to minimize detrimental impact to the base.
Remember, to respond effectively to emergencies, contingencies and disasters, procedures and plans must
be in place when the threat occu rs. Developing plans can be accomp lished in a wide variety of methods
and various levels of participation. This attachment outlines one proven method. Development is broken
down into five steps: research, preparation, coordination, publication, and review. This approach is appli-
cable to either military or civilian planning and ca n be utilized to develop everything ranging from sup-
port annexes to entire base support plans. 
A3.2.  STEP 1—Research. Plans are useful only if they are backed by good research. Determine what the
unit (or base) may be required to do and the place, conditions, and circ umstances that the unit (or base)
may have to operate if the plan is  executed. Research involves at least five sub-steps: understanding the
planning task; learning the base mission; reviewing existing plans and guidance documents; analyzing the
hazards and threats; and assessing unit (or base) response capability. 
A3.2.1.  Understand the Planning Task. This is the first step in any planning process. The expected
task and outcome must be established up front. Understand what the plan’s OPR wants from the unit.
Be flexible, as more is learned during research, the task may need modifying. 
A3.2.2.  Understand the Base’s Mission. The basis for any planning is to know the mission of the base.
Know the types of aircraft, their likely munitions and fuel loads, and priorities of aircraft to fulfill the
wing's priority mission(s) (e.g., fighters, loading bombs, loading missiles, tankers, ISR assets, etc.). 
A3.2.3.  Review Existing Plans an d Directives. The unit will seldom  need to create a plan from
scratch. First, review the plan to modify. Then read the documents the plan references and the docu-
ments of the supporting intelligence. Many Intel shops have the Worldwide Threat to Air Bases and
studies of the various weapon systems the enemy could bring against the base. Security Forces, FES,
and supporting medical facility will have copies of their s upport agreements. The logistics plans
office, contracting, and several other agencies may also have copies of support agreements with tenant
units and local authorities. This step is necessary to avoid “recreating the wheel.” 
A3.2.3.1.  Check the Supported Plans. Many base-level plans are written to support someone
else’s plans. Higher headquarters, another military service or agency, a local civilian agency, or the
military and civil forces of another nation may have written the plan the unit is supporting. If pos-
sible, always obtain and review a copy of the plan the unit is supporting. It will identify, with a fair
degree of clarity, what the authors expect the unit to do for them, who will control the implemen-
tation of the plan, where the unit wi ll be expected to go, what the unit should bring, and so on.
Plans written above the MAJCOM-level are normally too general to help write a base-level plan. 
A3.2.3.2.  Check Governing Directives. The AFIs , as supplemented by the MAJCOM, will usu-
ally contain good information about what the plan is supposed to address and how it is to be writ-
ten. Specific support tasks or responsibilities may also be covered in the AFI, especially if the task
160
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
is required by law. Support Agreements or contracts can provide another source of information
about the extent of operations the unit may be required to perform, when, and under what condi-
tions. A few examples of governing directives include AFI 10-211, AFI 10-403, AFI 10-2501,
AFI 10-401 and AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2. 
A3.2.3.3.  Check for Rela ted Publications. Check the Air Force electr onic publishing site for
related publications. If writing a h azardous material accident response plan, check the index for
publications that refer to environmental, hazardous material and accident response subjects. A
specific example would be AFI 10-2501. 
A3.2.3.4.  Verify Currency of Information. Nothing can destroy the value of the plan and its cred-
ibility as quickly as change. 
A3.2.3.4.1.  Check directives. Find out if the directives used to justify the requirements and to
task other agencies have been superseded. 
A3.2.3.4.2.  Check the supported plans. As the down sizing of military forces continues, check
the plans the unit is supporting. The unit may need to revise plans because units, or bases,
being supported, or from whom th e unit expected support, may have departed. Also, as the
threat or wing’s missions change, the unit may not be required to perform the same functions
at the same intensity as before. 
A3.2.3.4.3.  Ensure all referenced materials are valid. These could be checklists, other annexes
of the plan, other plans, regulations, forms, operating instructions and a variety of other items.
The specific reference may have changed location, been deleted, or no longer applies to the sit-
uation described. 
A3.2.3.4.4.  Check background files for pending information. AFI(s) are subject to modifica-
tion. Look for messages or memo randa that establish new pro cedures, policies, or require-
ments. For example, USAFE may decide to revise its policy on the operation and maintenance
of the collective protection systems. The unit needs to know that before it starts writing the
OPLAN Annex that deals with shelters. Similarly, if the MAJCOM or wing has just worked
out a new support agreement with the local nuclear power station, the unit should incorporate
the changes into the plan. 
A3.2.3.4.5.  Make certain the addresses, or ganizational symbols, abbreviations, etc., are cor-
rect. 
A3.2.4.  Hazard/Threat Analysis. A systematic hazard/threat analysis is an essential step in develop-
ing emergency, disaster, contingency, or operations plans. The analys is identifies all possible threats
and vulnerabilities, presents historical information about past disasters, assesses future probability and
frequency of emergencies, and validates gathered information. Considerations include predictability,
frequency, controllability, duration, scope, and intensity of hazards or threat s. There are three basic
steps in conducting a threat and hazards analysis, and they are: 
A3.2.4.1.  Hazard/Threat Identification. Gather information on the specific major accidents, natu-
ral disasters, hazardous material spills, and enemy attacks the base could face. Know the kind and
levels of damage to expect from foes. For exam ple, how the attack will be conducted, what kind
and size of weapons they will bring to bear against the base, what are their probable targets, how
often will they attack, etc? Learn the location of the hazards. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
161
A3.2.4.2.  Vulnerability Analysis. Identify the parts of the base or off-base community that may be
affected by each hazard or threat; the population within each zone that is subject to harm; critical
facilities or functions at risk (for example, hospital and command post); and property and environ-
mental systems that may be damaged. 
A3.2.4.3.  Risk Analysis. A risk analysis provides  a means to judge the relative likelihood of a
hazard/threat occurring and the magnitude of harm to personnel and mission should that hazard/
threat occur. In other words, attempt to determine the most probable incidents and their worst pos-
sible impact. The analysis includes judgments of the probability of occurrence and severity of con-
sequences. Consider natural disasters and major ac cidents as part of the planning for both peace
and wartime. Nature is not patriotic and does not take vacations. During combat operations the
chances of someone creating an accident go up because individuals are tired, equipment wears out,
and individuals may not be paying as much attention to safety as they should. Know what kinds of
incidents are most likely to occur and how they might affect the wing’s mission in the worst man-
ner. For example, ask if the base is subject to typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, heavy snow
storms, lightning storms, sand storms , earthquakes, forest fires, etc. Is the base likely to suffer
from sabotage or terrorist attacks? How will these incidents affect central power stations, POL
dumps or supply lines, natural ga s or fuel lines, water lines or towers, pumping stations, access
roads, etc.? Are there any points that multiple utility lines converge that could increase the danger
or damage if affected by the incident? What key command and control functions could be
adversely affected and how could they be protected? 
A3.2.5.  Capability Assessment. Next, develop a realistic evaluation of the base’s ability to prevent or
respond to accidents, natural disasters, hazardous material spills, and enemy attack. Understand what
resources the wing can bring to bear on various peace and wartime contingencies, how well the wing
is trained and prepared to respond, and where the wing is weak. For example, how many fire trucks,
and what kind, are available during peacetime? What are their capabilities? Is this quantity and capa-
bility sufficient? Where are they lo cated? Is this location close enou gh to allow them to fulfill their
duties? Does this location provide adequate protection from accidents, disasters, or attacks? Will more
trucks be available in wartime? If yes, where would the unit get them? Can wartime fire trucks be used
to help respond to a peacetime incident if they were needed? Where are the additional trucks located?
Are these vehicles protected? Ho w quickly can they be reached, equipped, manned, and made fully
operational? These same kinds of questions may be applied to nearly any wing organization. 
A3.2.5.1.  Be sure th e capability assessment includes other military services, host nation, allied
military forces, civil authorities, and government organizations that agree to help the base respond
to and recover from a disaster, accident, or attack. Be familiar with the kind and levels of support
that can be expected. For example, what kinds of facilities are available for use, what kinds of
communications capabilities will they provide, how many vehicles, and what types, can they pro-
vide for support, etc.? 
A3.2.5.2.  Know who controls which resources, where they plan to locate the resources, and how
well those resources are protected from the affects of weapons, disasters, or accidents. Since these
resources will be used to respond to various co ntingencies outlined in the plans, know whom to
contact in order to coordinate or implement the plan. Know wh ere the resources are going to be
and how well they will be protec ted so the unit can judge whether they will be readily available
and undamaged when the need for them arises. 
162
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
A3.2.5.3.  Know the wing’s priorities for protecting its resour ces. These priorities may change
depending on the situation. For example, in a peacetime CONUS environment the wing may want
to prioritize support for the local authorities during a natural disa ster. During combat overseas,
however, the wing will probably not be willing to expend many of its assets to respond in support
of the civil authorities. Know what the wing wants to protect when, and how well it must be pro-
tected. 
A3.2.6.  Other Sources of Information. Two other sources of information should be considered when
researching a plan. 
A3.2.6.1.  On-Base Agencies. The wing plans office should be able to tell the unit all about the
wing’s mission. Group and unit planning offices will usually know their ca pabilities and weak-
nesses and they will be able to tell the unit who owns what, where it is, and if it is protected. With
them, CE may need to determine if the current level of protection is adequate. The wing’s support-
ing intelligence shop and the Office of Special Investigation should be able to identify whom the
enemies are. Security Forces, safety office, and FES should be able to help with records on major
accidents or mishaps. The bioenvironmental engi neers, FES, and the logistics group’ s mainte-
nance, supply and transportation units should be able to provide the location, quantities, common
uses, and transportation details of most hazardous materials on base. The supporting weather shop
should be able to provide information on the local natural disaster hazards. 
A3.2.6.2.  Off-Base Agencies. Consult with local Civil Defense, Red Cross (or Red Crescent),
host nation civil and military auth orities, and other emergency response agencies and officials.
This can help form a clear pict ure of the kinds of haz ardous materials transported near the base
and how often they pass. They may be able to provide a local history of the area’s natural disasters,
major accidents, and intentional acts that caused significant damage (set forest fires, vandalism on
facilities, etc.). This consultation can also help  clarify what they think CE can do for them and
what they can do for CE. The US Army Corps of Engineers can help determine the probability of
the base suffering floods or other kinds of related disasters. USAF units with similar missions, or
in similar areas, and the MAJCOM can provide guidance on the historical trends of incidents that
happen to bases in similar circ umstances or with similar mission s. If overseas, contact the units
that provide short range and point air defenses and perimeter security (if other than USAF security
police). 
A3.3.  STEP 2—Preparation. Plans are easier to use when the information and guidance is pertinent, con-
cise, clearly written and intuitively laid out. The best plans can be ruin ed by small things, like incorrect
spelling, poor grammar, and misused punctuation. Poorly written plans lack validity to users, because
they may feel that if it was not important enough to author correctly, it must not be important information. 
A3.3.1.  Content. Prepare a first draft. Keep it realistic, legal, and consistent with wing or higher head-
quarter guidance. The plan must answer the classic five Ws: who, what, when, where, and why; some-
times the plan may also need to address how. Discuss who will do what, when and where they will do
it, why they will do it, how they will do it, and what they will use. The answers to these questions will
change at different stages of preparation, response, or execution. Provide answers to at least the fol-
lowing questions. 
A3.3.1.1.  Who: 
A3.3.1.1.1.  Supports us? 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
163
A3.3.1.1.2.  Do we support? 
A3.3.1.1.3.  Directs implementation or termination of which parts of the plan? 
A3.3.1.1.4.  Funds which parts of the plan? 
A3.3.1.1.5.  Commands or controls the resources (personnel, vehicles, supplies, materials, and
equipment) that will be used to execute various parts of the plan? 
A3.3.1.1.6.  Will operate the equipment necessary to execute the plan? 
A3.3.1.1.7.  Will write what parts of the plan  and the supporting documents (checklists, ros-
ters, equipment lists, diagrams, etc.)? 
A3.3.1.2.  What: 
A3.3.1.2.1.  Situation, or set of circumstances, is each part of the plan designed to handle? 
A3.3.1.2.2.  Are the basic assumptions? 
A3.3.1.2.3.  Specific duties, or functions, are various agencies meant to perform in order to
execute the different parts of the plan? 
A3.3.1.2.4.  Resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles, supplies, or material) are the various
agencies meant to provide or employ to execute the different parts of the plan? 
A3.3.1.2.5.  Criteria will be used to judge progress of plan execution? 
A3.3.1.3.  When: 
A3.3.1.3.1.  Do different parts of the plan take effect? 
A3.3.1.3.2.  Will funds become available for each part of the plan? 
A3.3.1.3.3.  Must resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles, supplies, or material) be made
available, prepared, positioned, or employed in order to execute each part of the plan? 
A3.3.1.3.4.  Does the plan terminate? 
A3.3.1.3.5.  Does CE file which reports? 
A3.3.1.4.  Where: 
A3.3.1.4.1.  Do personnel perform their duties or functions to execute each part of the plan? 
A3.3.1.4.2.  Must resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles, supplies, or material) be assem-
bled, stored, sent or employed to execute or terminate the plan? 
A3.3.1.4.3.  The unit sends what reports? 
A3.3.1.5.  Why: 
A3.3.1.5.1.  Does CE write and execute this plan (purpose of the plan)? 
A3.3.1.5.2.  Does CE perform certain aspects of this plan in a certain order? 
A3.3.1.6.  How: 
A3.3.1.6.1.  Will CE communicate or pass notification? 
A3.3.1.6.2.  Will CE evaluate the effectiveness of operations or the quality of work? 
164
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
A3.3.1.6.3.  Should CE disperse resources? 
A3.3.1.6.4.  Does CE account for resources? 
A3.3.1.6.5.  Will CE protect resources? 
A3.3.1.6.6.  Does CE report operations, attack results, the wing’s status, etc.? 
A3.3.2.  Format. The format is specified in th e governing directives. For example, AFMAN 10-401,
Volume 2, dictates the outline of an operation plan, and AFI 10-2501 provides the format for a disaster
or accident plan. The format for each is similar. 
A3.3.3.  Style. Write the draft plan in a style easy to read. Common writing principles apply. Obtain a
copy of AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill and use it. 
A3.4.  STEP 3—Coordination. Failure to properly coordinate a plan can cause confusion, consternation,
and conflict. Plans should not come as a surprise to anyone except the enemy. 
A3.4.1.  Every agency that is tasked to participate in the plan should review and comment on it. 
A3.4.2.  Steps in Coordination. Revise the plan as necessary after eac h step in the coordination pro-
cess. Some comments and recommendations for change are inappropriate or based on incorrect or out-
dated information. If a suggested change is not made, contact the individual that requested the revision
and explain reasons for disapproving the modification. 
A3.4.2.1.  Have experts within the unit review a nd comment on the draft first. These individuals
may have an insight, experience, or knowledge th e author lacks. Their advice could improve the
plan and save unit credibility. 
A3.4.2.2.  Obtain comments from functional experts.  These are the working level experts dealt
with regularly. They should be the most familiar  with their units’ abilities, responsibilities, and
shortages. They help improve the plan and clear up the details before it goes to commanders for
review. 
A3.4.2.3.  Obtain unit commanders’ comments or approval. This is the opportunity for squadron
commanders to provide their thoughts and beliefs. They will usually be particularly interested in
funding, manpower, and equipment issues. They may need briefi ng a couple times before they
approve the plan. Always brief the CE commander first. 
A3.4.2.4.  Receive coordination from local civil authorities, other services, and host nation equiv-
alents when they are players. 
A3.4.2.5.  Obtain group commanders’ comments or approval. As with the squadron commanders,
group commanders will want to interject their thoughts. They  may know less about the specific
rules than the unit may, but they have a better view of the “big picture.” Their comments may
reflect larger issues. 
A3.4.2.6.  Obtain wing commander’s comments or approval; this is the ultimate test. In general, if
the plan gets this far there should be very little need for changes. Be ready to brief the wing com-
mander if required, but only cove r the highlights. Go into details when asked, so be prepared to
cover them. The wing commander will probably have little knowledge of the mundane details, but
will be extremely familiar with MAJCOM requirements, overall policy, and direction. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
165
A3.4.2.7.  Receive higher headquarters approval if necessary. Some of the plans may require coor-
dination with higher headquarters, especially if in support of a particular contingency or crisis. 
A3.4.3.  Paperwork. Create a good paper trail during the coordination process. The unit may need to
reengage individuals and get additional clarification or request more changes. Most commanders want
proof that their experts reviewed and agreed with the plan bef ore they review and approve it. The
cover memorandum should inform individuals why they are reviewing the plan, the purpose of the
plan, what parts of the plan they are to review, what they should do  if they have questions or com-
ments (do they contact CE, the OPR, write on the plan itself, or what?). In addition, it should let them
know when they should return the plan and to whom, and any other info rmation they should know
(background, pending changes to policy or procedures, etc.). 
A3.5.  STEP 4—Publication. Find out who locally is responsible for publishing the plan. If not CE, it may
be the responsibility of the wing plans office. They will usually require documentation of the plan review
and make any required changes. They may also ask the author to prepare DD Form 844, Requisition for
Local Duplicating Service. 
A3.6.  STEP 5—Review. Plans are never permanent. Plans require change for any number of reasons and
scheduled reviews help keep plans up to date. In general, conduct reviews annually, when the threat
changes, when the mission changes, and when unit capabilities change.

OUR FOUNDATIONS: A HISTORY OF AIR FORCE CIVIL ENGINEERS 
A4.1.  A Proud Heritage. Air Force Civil Engineers have a proud heritage tracing back to before World
War I. Originally, the engineering function was a small unit of the Army Signal Corps and construction
was handled through the Office of the Chief Signal Officer. When the Air Se rvice was established in
1918, the Building and Grounds Bran ch of the Division of  Military Aeronautics inherited maintenance
and construction responsibilities (in conjunction with the Construction Division of the War Department)
for ten flying schools, one repair depot, and five  balloon schools. In 1921, cons truction of Air Service
projects was turned over to the Construction Service, Quartermaster Corps, working closely with the Air
Service (later Air Corps) Building and Grounds office. Throughout the 1930s, the Air Corps continued to
slowly expand. The availability of Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds facilitated construction
that otherwise would not have be en undertaken by the Air Corps. In 1940, construction of Army Air
Corps facilities in the Zone of In terior (the continental United States) was transferred to the Corps of
Engineers. For overseas construction, a new type of engineering organization was established. 
Figure A4.1.  Constructing Expedient Airfields During WWII. 
A4.2.  World War II. Long before Pearl Harbor, the growing Army Air Forces indicated the vital need for
engineers specialized in the building of airfields overseas in support of tactical  and strategic air opera-
tions. The Air Forces needed their own engineers; troops who trained with it, spoke its language and
understood its needs. These men were to be trained and equipped to rapidly construct advanced airfields
close to or even behind en emy lines. They were also to be trained to improve  and maintain the existing
facilities. They were to be skilled in the camouflage of airfields and the construction of defensive works.
They were to be organized and prepared to repair airfields dama ged by enemy bombing. Fina lly, with
their trained riflemen and machine gunners, they were to be prepared to take an active part in the defense
of their airdromes. Such was the concept of the Aviation Engineers—troops who were trained to con-
struct, conceal, maintain and defend airfields. 
A4.2.1.  In June 1940, a handful of officers and 80 enlisted men assembled at Fort Benning, Georgia,
to form the 21st Engineer (Aviation) Regiment, the first of its kind and the parent unit of the more than
100,000 Aviation Engineers who served in WWII. Originally established with 27 engineer officers
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
167
and 761 enlisted men, each aviation engineer battalion was programmed for a lavish amount of equip-
ment, including 220 items for construction and 146 vehicles—diesel tractors with bulldozers, carryall
scrapers, graders, gasoline shovels, rollers, mixers, air compressors, drills, trucks, trailers, asphalting
and concreting equipment, rock crushers, draglines, and pumps—for its mission. To protect them-
selves from air and ground attack, the Aviation Engineers were trained and equipped for combat as
well as construction. They were armed with a v ariety of weapons including bazookas, antitank and
antiaircraft guns, grenade launchers, armed half-tracks, antitank mines and a full complement of small
arms. 
A4.2.2.  In addition to the regular aviation engineer battalions, airborne battalions were conceived in
early 1942 for mobile use in an invasion. Sixteen airborne aviation engineer battalions were organized
in 1943, each with a complement of 28 officers and 500 men and light  equipment such as miniature
tractors, scrapers, rollers, a supply of weapons, and radio equipment. These specialized units were
designed to parachute into enemy territory, to establish an emergency strip, and, with light equipment
landed by gliders, to improve the runway until it could accommodate transports and tactical planes
(Figure A4.2.). 
Figure A4.2.  Lightweight, Air Transportable Heavy Equipment in use during WW II. 
A4.2.3.  One of their successful operations occurred in North Africa. Major General James H. Doolit-
tle, Commander, 12th Air Force, needed a dry base close to the front for his heavy bombers. Brigadier
General Donald A. Davison, Chief Engineer, Allied Forces, found a large sandy expanse near Biskra,
deep in the Sahara. Because the conventional battalions were already busy on other projects, he called
in the airborne engineers. Troop transport planes carried the engineers and their specially designed
miniature equipment to Biskra, almost a thousand miles. They arrived on the evening of 13 December
and began work immediately. Twenty-four hours later, the first B-17 arrived from Oran. The bombers
were out of the mud and used th e base until the following March, when spring winds blew sand in
such quantities as to make operations impossible. The airborne engineers also functioned as smoothly
and as efficiently as in a textbo ok exercise under conditions impossible for a standard battalion in
Burma and at Tsili Tsili in New Guinea. But, in general, their equipment was too light and the whole
concept of their purpose was too specialized for general use. Theater commanders greatly preferred
the standard battalion, and the air borne units sometimes sat idle or we re used in routine small jobs;
eventually, many of them were either mer ged with other units or given no rmal size equipment and
168
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
fought as standard battalions. The successes showed that there was some need for the airborne engi-
neer unit but certainly not in the numbers which were formed. 
A4.2.4.  Immediately following the American entry into the war, aviation engineer units were sent to
England to help service support engineers prepare bases for the scores of planes which would soon
follow. The Aviation Engineers saw action in the deserts of Nort h Africa beginning in November
1942. Four battalions stationed in England (809th, 814th, 815th, and 817th) accompanied the initial
assault forces at Oran, Morocco. 
A4.2.5.  The battalions landed without incident and usually without their equipment. The men of the
814th walked 12 miles to their project site only to fill in holes, dig up duds, and remain idle because
their heavy equipment had been appropriated by another unit after being unloaded. The ship carrying
the 815th's equipment was sunk and the 809th's equi pment was on a ship that had developed engine
trouble 2 days out of England and turned back. 
A4.2.6.  When the units finally began their work in earnest, the major obstacle to constructing airfields
along the coasts of North Africa was not the German s or even the Italians, but “General Mud.” The
engineers had landed during the rainy season. General Davison described the construction of the air-
drome at Tafaraoui, “To any aviation engineer in North Africa, the word Tafaraoui does not mean an
airport alone, it means also a malignant quality of mud; something like wet concrete and of bottomless
depth. We still speak of any bad type of mud as Tafaraoui.” 
A4.2.7.  Through active planning and cooperation between engineer and planner, the Aviation Engi-
neers were almost always at the front lines, or sometimes even ahead of them. One night General
Davison was looking for the engineers of “B” company, 814th Battalion, when he was stopped by sen-
tries from the 1st Armored Division,  “They stopped me a nd asked me if I knew  I was going out in
front of their patrols. I said, ‘No that I didn't know that but I wanted to ask them one question—had a
certain engineer company gone through and were they out in front?’ and they said ‘Yes, if you mean
those damn fools who wouldn’t pay any attention to us and took those big machines out, we think they
are about 10 or 15 miles down the road.’ and I said, ‘That was what  I wanted to know.’ I found “B”
company dug in with its defensive weapons in place and already at work. It was by keeping in touch
with the planning…that we were able to do this.” 
A4.2.8.  The base at Bone, the easternmost port available to the Allies, was perhaps the most difficult
but probably the most rewarding to build. The only possible site for the all-weather airfield was a delta
in the Seybouse River mouth. But the area was pure mud. The solution was to use sand available along
the coast. Unfortunately, the sand dunes were on the opposite side of the river from the construction
site. The men constructed a causeway across the river, a roadway on the delta, and began to bring in
sand from the dunes. Although the s ite was under Axis air attack, rain was the enemy the engineers
feared most. A rare dry spell allowed the engineers to bring the sand across and finish the runway just
hours before rain washed away the causeway. 
A4.2.9.  Shortly after completing the runway at Bone, the e ngineers received the most gratifying of
rewards. A B-26 returning from a mission had become lost and was a bout to run out of fuel. While
headed for a ditching in the Mediterranean Sea, the pilot happened to glance down and see the “long-
est runway he had seen in North Africa” at Bone. He made one sharp turn and landed without enough
gas left to taxi his plane off the runway (Figure A4.3.).

Figure A4.3.  Bomber Landing on Completed Portion of Airstrip. 
A4.2.10.  The Aviation Engineers proved themselves in North Africa. By the end of the campaign the
ten battalions in theater had built or improved 129 airdromes. General Carl Spaatz, commander of the
Northwest African Air Forces, stated, “the Aviation Engineers have become as nearly indispensable to
the Army Air Force as is possible to ascribe to any single branch thereof.” 
A4.2.11.  The close working relationship forged between the engineers and the fliers in North Africa
continued in Sicily and Italy and was a key to the Allies’ success on the European continent. 
A4.2.12.  In the Sicilian campaign, the task of the Army Air Forces (AAF) engineers was to provide
airstrips in support of the US Seventh Army, and though their officers had little advance knowledge of
conditions on the island, the Aviation Engineers were able to keep up with the whirlwind campaign.
As it ended, the long-sought sepa rate organization came with the formation of the AAF Engineer
Command, which was to serve as a model for the larger structure used later in the invasion of northern
Europe. 
A4.2.13.  The invasion of Italy called first for the familiar procedure of laying down emergency
fighter strips, in Calabria and then for Anzio. Later came the less spectacular but more lasting task of
building all-weather fields for strategic bombers in Apulia and around Foggia; in both areas the heavy
rains of “sunny” Italy caused serious but not insurmountable difficulties. By comparison, the assign-
ments in Corsica and southern France in connection with the DRAGOON operation were routine. 
A4.2.14.  Operation OVERLORD’s planners recognized that airfield availability would be a deter-
mining factor in its success or failure. A tactical ai r force, to be truly ef fective, required airfields as
close to the front lines as possible to support a fluid and fast-moving operation. To provide these air-
fields, a new organization was established, the IX Engineer Command. Originally, no separate engi-
neer command had been planned. However, because of the North African experience, where aviation
engineers functioned as an integral part of the air force, Army Air Forces leaders such as Lieutenant
General Lewis Brereton strongly pressed for an engineer command. A provisional command con-
ducted the training for the aviation engineer ba ttalions until March 30, 1944, when the IX Engineer
Command was activated. Four regimental headquarters commanded sixteen battalions of engineers,
while the command headquarters retained control of three airborne battalions and a camouflage battal-

A4.2.15.  At 1050, 6 June 1944, first squad, third platoon of Company A of the 819th Engineer Avia-
tion Battalion landed at Utah Beach, under the command of First Lieutenant Herbert H. Moore. When
the ramp was lowered, the engineers waded the final 200 yards to the beach in waist-deep water . A
D-7 tractor followed closely behind and after that came the second squad, th en a motor grader, the
third squad, another grader, a 2 1/2 ton truck, and finally another D-7 tractor. Men and equipment dis-
persed on the beach with only one casualty from shrapnel. Lieutenant Moore had to wait until the
infantry had taken the land for the emergency landing strip. Although the equipment had dispersed on
what turned out to be mud flats, it was extricated and reac hed the site by 1800. Work commenced
immediately and the engineers completed the strip by 2115 (Figure A4.5.). The men dug foxholes and
spent their first night on the continent avoiding the considerable sniper fire. 
A4.2.16.  The landings at Omaha did not go as planned. Elements of the 834th, under the command of
Lieutenant Colonel John Livingston, made repeated attempts to land at their scheduled location. Their
landing craft grounded several times on beach obstacles in point blank fire. On D+1, the unit beached
at the nearest feasible location, several miles east of the planned site. The remaining elements of the
unit landed at various locations up and down the coast. The scattered troops met at their in transit area,
but found the planned sites for airfields still under enemy control.

A4.2.17.  The lead party of the 820th proceeded up Omaha Beach to within two miles from the shore
when a Navy patrol ordered them to return and stay clear of the Ge rman shelling of the beach. Later
in the afternoon, they succeeded in reaching the beach, but a shell struck close by just as the ramp was
being lowered, injuring several men from other units who were also in the craft, and seriously damag-
ing the craft itself. They turned back and tied up to a landing ship, tank (LST) for the night. The next
morning, another landing craft towed them to shore. 
A4.2.18.  The two initially planned sites remained in enemy hands by D+2,  so the engineers of t he
820th and 834th found another suitable location near St. Laurent-sur-Mer. They rapidly scraped out an
emergency landing strip at the site, still waiting fo r the other sites to be taken. The Army made an
urgent request for an airstrip to evacuate wounde d soldiers and receive emergency supplies, so the
engineers continued to develop the St. Laurent-sur-Mer emergency landing strip into a transport strip.
By 2100 on D+2, they had constructed a 3,500 by 140-foot runway that received its first aircraft the
following morning. For the next seve ral weeks, an average of 100 C-47s landed at the airfield daily.
Although unplanned, this became the first operational American airfield in France. 
A4.2.19.  Engineers continued to construct airfields in the weeks following the invasion. Men of the
816th marched 14 miles inland to the site of their planned airfield at Cardonville. They arrived in time
to help the Rangers clear the area of German soldiers, taking thirteen prisoners. On 13 June, they com-
plete the new airfield that supported 500 fighter sorties in the first week. By the end of June, 11 Amer-
ican airfields were in operation and five more under construction. The original plans called for
approximately two-thirds of the airfields to be bu ilt to fighter specifications—a 3,600-foot runway.
However, the Luftwaffe's ineffectual reaction to the invasion perm itted the Ninth Air Force to use
their aircraft as fighter/ bombers, which dictated the construction of 5,000-foot runways. 
A4.2.20.  Aviation Engineers used three types of expedient runway materials during WW II: Marston
Mat (known as Pierced Steel Planking or PSP), Hessian Matting, and Square Mesh T rack. PSP was
172
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
first tested at Langley Field, Virginia, in 1940. It was an example of design genius because of its sim-
plicity, functionality, and endurance. Each section was 10 feet long, 15 inches wide, and weighed 66.2
pounds. Originally manufactured as a solid plank of ribbed steel, engineers decided that punching
holes would reduce the weight by 17.5 percent, help drain water a nd allow drying of the soil under-
neath, permit backfill to be poured  into soft spots or depressions, and contribute to camouflage and
dust control by letting vegetation grow through the holes (Figure A4.6.). 
Figure A4.6.  Engineers Laying Pierced Steel Planking. 
A4.2.21.  Assembly of the PSP into a runway was a simple process. Each mat had thirty slots and
L-shaped hooks on both long edges. One or two men dropped the hooks of one piece into the slots of
another and then shoved it forward 2 inches, l ocking the pieces together. Easily removed U-shaped
steel clips provided further locking protection on the runway edge. The engineers laid the mat length-
wise, across the runway, usually beginning in the middle and working towards both ends. As the avi-
ation engineer troops became prof icient, they were able to lay mat from both ends and the middle
simultaneously. Any discrepancy was solved by dragging sections into place with bulldozers. The
subsurface was a variety of materials, depending on the projected permanence of the runway, locally
available materials, and the existing soil conditions. Leaves, palm branches, or straw created an effec-
tive barrier reducing the dus t problem (Figure A4.7.). Repair of PSP was easy because the planks
were laid with the hooks on one row facing the opposite direction of the next row. Two men with pry
bars could remove a single mat or repair it in place. If the base below the PSP runway needed major
repairs, large sections of planking could be rolled up to allow equipment to make the repairs. The run-
way could then simply be unrolled. At the end of the war, two million tons of PSP had been manufac-
tured, enough to build nearly a thousand 150- by 5,000-foot runways.

A4.2.22.  Prefabricated Hessian Surfacing, known as Hessian Matting, was a common runway mate-
rial used on the continent of Eur ope following the D-Day Invasion. It was a Hessian cloth (a type of
burlap) coated with bitumen that had no load bearing capacity, but served as a waterproof cover for the
grade (Figure A4.8.). 
Figure A4.8.  Square Mesh Track Being Unrolled on Top of Hessian Matting. 
A4.2.23.  Hessian Matting was laid in long itudinal strips, using a 50-percent overlap, thus giving a
double thickness throughout. To facilitate accurate overlapping, the material had a red center line. The
British developed a machine known as a “Stamplicker” to lay the matting. This device applied solvent
(usually diesel fuel) to the bottom of the material as it unrolled off the truck onto the ground. The ends
of the rolls were stapled together as they passed through the machine to make one long strip. Because
these runways were slippery when wet, engineers sprayed the completed runway with diesel fuel and
applied a coating of sand that was rolled into the surface by rolle rs. This provided an ef fective
anti-skid surface. 
174
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
A4.2.24.  Aviation engineers needed a temporary surfa cing material for airfields to be used by light
and medium weight aircraft. The r unway material had to be lightwe ight, easily transportable, and
quickly laid. In 1944, th ey began experimenting with concrete reinforcing mesh manufactured in
England. Square Mesh Track had initial problems with excessive billo wing and a failure of clips to
hold the material together. The solution was to stretch the Square Mesh Track by pulling it with trucks
and crimping individual wires. 
A4.2.25.  Square Mesh Track's greatest advantage was its light wei ght. Square Mesh Track required
only 250 tons of material for a 120- by 3,600-foot runway, compared to 1,150 tons for PSP. Engineers
unrolled the track either by hand or by pushing it in front of a jeep. As engineers tried different meth-
ods, they found that Square Mesh Track laid on top of Hessian Matting provided a satisfactory runway
material. When rain and snow caused PSP to be adopted as the main surfacing material, Square Mesh
Track was used in many of the “Sandwich” jobs that included Hessian Matting, Square Mesh Track,
and PSP (Figure A4.9.). 
Figure A4.9.  “Sandwich” Runway Surface. 
A4.2.26.  From D-Day until V-E Day the activities of IX Engineer co mmand were intimately
entwined with those of the tactical air forces and, indeed, with those of the ground troops. Along with
other invading forces, the engineers were hampered by the rugged re sistance of the Germans at the
beaches and in Normandy; their schedules were disrupted by the slow breakout from the Cotentin and
equally by the unexpectedly rapid advance thereafter. Important changes in plans were required by the
need for more fighter-bomber fields than had b een predicted and by the decision to base medium
bombers on the Continent. 
A4.2.27.  As the First and Third Armies moved across France supported by, respectively, the IX and
XIX Tactical Air Commands, the Engineer Command was split into the lst and 2nd Engineer Aviation
Brigades, each with the duty of providing the advancing armies a series of airfields in immediate sup-
port. Supply and transportation were never adequate, and aviation engineers were hard put to keep up
with the breakneck pace of the ground troops. By V-E Day, 8 May 1945, nearly 250 airfields had been
constructed or reconditioned for Allied use from Normandy to Austria and Czechoslovakia; 182 were
still in use on V-E Day. During their peak period, the IX Engineer Command put an airfield into ser-
vice every 36 hours (Figure A4.10.).

A4.3.  Pacific Theater. Aviation Engineers saw action quite early during the War in the Pacific. The 803rd
Battalion endured a 5-month journey to the Philippines in 1941, arriving just a few weeks before the Jap-
anese attacked. The men repaired  airfields, scraped out emergency runways and performed whatever
engineering work was required. They soon found themselves serving as infantry troops, turning back a
Japanese suicide attack at one point. The Japanese captured two of the companies on Bataan, with Com-
pany A managing to evade escape and reach Corregi dor. These engineers became consumed in the des-
perate and unsuccessful campaign to keep Kindley Fiel d operational, and eventually became one of the
last units to surrender to  the overwhelming Japanese attacked at Corregidor. The Aviation Engineering
companies captured at Corregidor and Bataan would become part of and suffer through one of the greatest
atrocities of World War II during the Bataan Death March. During this march the Aviation Engineers and
other US Army units, over 75,000 personnel in all, were marched nearly 100 miles to Camp O’Donnell, a
US constructed Philippine Training base captured by the Japanese. 
A4.3.1.  In the Pacific and Chi na-Burma-India (CBI) theaters, Aviation Engineers constructed air-
fields on coconut-forested atolls and in steamy jungles (Figure A4.11.), as the American forces closed
in on the Japanese homeland supporting MacArt hur’s island hopping campaign. The engineers were
often forced to abandon their construction equipment and pick up their weapons to defend their posi-
tions against the Japanese. In few instances were the Aviation Engineers in the Pacific areas or in the
CBI able to call on the resources of an industrial society. Their supply problems were compounded by
distance and low priorities. In the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA), Aviation Engineers began their
operations at Darwin in Australia early in 1942 and finished fa r to the north as the war ended. From
the first, they worked side by side with Army and Navy engineers. 
A4.3.2.  Aviation engineers on the other front of the Pa cific campaign fought extreme climatic and
austere supply chains to create an aerial supply route across the Himalayas supporting British, Indian,
Chinese, and American forces facing the Japanese. These airfields were critical to the support of these
176
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
actions since the engineers constructing the overland route were faced with a virtually impassable bar-
rier of mountains, rivers and jungles. 
Figure A4.11.  Airstrip Being Cut Out of a Tropical Jungle. 
A4.3.3.  As SWPA forces held at Port Moresby a nd then began the slow movement northward, each
jump in the hopscotch pattern of advance depended upon the previous development of new air bases.
The terrain often was rugged, living conditions were extremely primitive, and the climate was debili-
tating and unhealthy. Sites for airfields had to be chosen based on inadequate information, and land
transportation was incredibly difficult. These factors made for the unorthodox methods, and in many
cases, the standards accepted for airstrips were far different from those demanded in the CONUS or in
the European theater of operations. But, whatever the book may have said, the strips laboriously hewn
out of jungles or laid on coral islands (Figure A4.12.) still under enemy fire usually stood up to the
pragmatic test of hard use. Road building frequently became a necessary adjunct to airfield construc-
tion, and more often than they liked, aviation engineers were employed in miscellaneous tasks bearing
little relation to the air war. 
A4.3.4.  Occasionally, advance intelligence was so faulty as to require a radical revision of plans, as at
Hollandia, where designs for a huge complex of bases to be built by 25,000 Aviation Engineers were
scaled down to a minimum, with most of the force moving on to develop an airfield on another island
instead. In regard both to construction supplies and provisions for their own existence, Aviation Engi-
neers felt that they suffered unduly while the Seabees lived a life of plenty; they also felt some resent-
ment when the highly publici zed Seabees received wide acclaim for accomplishments no different
from those of the unsung Aviation Engineers.

Figure A4.12.  Airstrip Constructed on Pacific Coral Island. 
A4.3.5.  With the return to the Philippines, Aviation Engineers passed a crucial test under fire in the
mud of Leyte, and then moved northward to Mind oro and Luzon, where a variety of tasks necessary
for the restoration of those islands competed with airfield construction for the attention of the e ngi-
neers. 
A4.3.6.  In the North Pacific the Japanese threat of June 1942 seemed to reinforce ideas about the stra-
tegic importance of Alaska and to demand the immediate extension of ai r facilities in the area. As a
point of attack against Japanese-held Kiska and Attu, two companies of Aviation Engineers built a
usable airfield on Adak, Amchitka, and Attu work ing under the extreme climatic conditions imagin-
able. 
A4.3.7.  In the China-Burma-India theater , the activities of the Aviation Engineers were as far from
normal as were most operations in that vast theater of operations. In China there were no US aviation
engineer units and only a handful of officers to advise General Chennault, and to some extent, the Chi-
nese who built his airfields. In India the T enth Air Force used fields prepared by native labor under
British supervision. Until 1944, all five aviation engineer battalions in CBI were assigned to work on
the Ledo Road, where they were joined later by thr ee other battalions. Their fine work was finished
only with the completion of the ro ad early in 1945. Though some units then moved into China, they
arrived too late to accomplish much before Victory in Japan or V-J Day. Perhaps the most nearly nor-
mal project in the theater was when Aviation Engineers, under AAF control, supported the campaign
in Burma and developed the important complex of bases around Myitkyna. 
A4.3.8.  The task of preparing bases for the B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command in the Marianas was
one of the largest jobs Aviation Engineers faced during the Pacific campaign, but it went smoothly .
Fifteen battalions were available for developing the islands. Plans based on insufficient data had to be
modified frequently. Nevertheless, the B-29 fields with their then generous airfield criteria were built
in time to accommodate the constantly expanding force of heavy bombers. An even greater construc-
tion project, involving the use of 93 aviation engi neer battalions, was planned for Okinawa but was
178
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
canceled when Japan surrendered. Had World War II continued a few months longer, many of the vet-
eran aviation engineer units of the European theater would have been assigned to this mammoth con-
struction program. Instead, most of the Aviation Engineers went home and after discharge participated
in the greatest building boom in American history. 
A4.3.9.  During most of World War II, general service engineers known as Post Engineers carried out
maintenance and repair of Army Air Forces installations. At the end of the war, 1,435 airfields located
in 67 foreign countries had been used, built, or improved for or by the Army Air Forces. In the Zone
of Interior, 504 airfields were on an active status and 136 on a temporary inactive status. 
A4.3.10.  When the Air Force became a separate service in 1947, Air Force construction continued to
be programmed and budgeted by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Air Force Civil Engineer function
operated as the Directorate of Installations under the Deputy Chief of Staff, Materiel. At the base
level, the Air Installation Officer was responsible for the repair and maintenance of installation facili-
ties, grounds, and utilities. 
A4.3.11.  Early in WW II (38, 39, and 40) the Army High Command took a long look at itself and saw
that serious reorganization was required to fight the war that was coming. Among the changes made
was the reassignment of the Army Fire Department responsibility from the Quartermaster Corps to the
Corps of Engineers (COE) on 4 December 1941, three days before Pearl Harbor. The COE inherited
an existing program and assumed all would roll along comfortably. On December 7 the COE discov-
ered it would have to fight fire around the world with soldiers and with equipment designed for State
side Army posts. During the next 6 months COE studied, designed, and planned their overseas fire
departments. On 1 July 1942, the Engineer Fire Fighting Detachment (EFFD) and the Army Engineer
soldier fire fighter (military occupational specialty, or MOS, 383) were authorized for activation. The
first 10 EFFDs were activ ated at Camp Claiborne Louisiana on  31 August 1942. The cadre of each
Detachment was drawn largely from Infantry units with the hope that at least some of them had some
fire fighting experience. Very few did. The balance of the staffing was Selective Service inductees.
The first 4 EFFDs (1, 2, 4 and 5) deployed 1 April 1943 to North Africa, 3, 6, 7, 8 to North Africa and
9 and 10 followed them shortly to England. The Detachments brought only personal gear and weap-
ons. Vehicles and everything else was drawn on arrival. 
A4.3.12.  On 15 August 1943 these 10 EFFDs, and maybe more if more had trained and deployed by
that date, were renumbered and renamed to th e 1201st through 1210th Engineer Fire Fighting Pla-
toons (EFFP). They were organized and equipped per T/O & E 5-337, 12 M ay 1943, Engineer Fire
Fighting Platoon. It is here that  these EFFPs would divide by func tion. EFFPs being general service
fire fighters and the Engineer Aviation Fire Fighting Platoons (EAFFP) that would come a bit later
appeared. The units were identical in officer and enlisted staffing and support vehicles.

A4.3.13.  Fire protection has been a critical part of the Air Force Civil Engineering since January
1945, when War Department Circular No. 36 transfer red all crash rescue and firefighting activities
and equipment from the Army Service Forces to the AAF. At HQ AAF, fire protection was assigned
to the Assistant Chief of Staff, Materiel and Services, Air Installations Division. 
A4.3.14.  At the base, structural fi refighting was under the post engin eer, while aircraft crash rescue
(Figure A4.14.) reported to the aircraft maintenance officer. In 1949, these were placed under the Air
Installation Officer. The two functions were integrated under a single Air For ce specialty code in
1953. 
Figure A4.14.  Firefighters Practicing a New Crash Rescue Technique (1945). 
A4.4.  Korean War. The Korean War presented tremendous challenges for Air Force engineers. Although
the Air Force had become a separate entity under the National Security Act of 1947, it did not possess a
separate and unique engineering capability. In response to a significant airfield engineering and construc-
tion need, the US Army created Special Category Army personnel with Air Force, or SCARWAF. SCAR-
WAF troops were responsible for the construction, upgrading, expansion, and rehabilitation of airfields
and operated under the Command of USAF control until 1951 when the Army resumed control and train-
ing. In 1951, the organization had the Air Force furnishing funding an d manpower authorizations while
the Army organized, trained, and equipped SCARWAF engineer units and then placed them under Air
Force control. 
180
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
A4.4.1.  This confusing concept led to a number of problems that hampered the engineers throughout
the war. At the beginning of the Korean War SCARWAF battalions combat effectiveness was rated at
approximately 15% of the World War II Aviation Engineer battalions. Commanders and personnel
assigned to SCARWAF units felt they belonged to neither the Air Force nor the Army as neither
agency took responsibility for maintaining an effective and equipped engineering force. 
A4.4.2.  A SCARWAF battalion initially had an aut horized strength of 800 men. In July 1951, each
battalion increased to 977 personnel . During the first ye ar of the war, most units were woefully ill
equipped and under strength. The manning they did possess was often poorly tr ained and inexperi-
enced. 
A4.4.3.  Two SCARWAF groups were assigned to the First Construction Command, Fifth Air Force.
The 930th EAG Headquarters and Se rvice Company oversaw civilian construction while military
construction would be handled by the 931st EAG, assigned to 12th AF, with units located in Guam and
Okinawa. This unit was disbanded in December 1950 and the Fifth Air Force Director of Installations
was given command of both SCARWAF troops and installation squadrons. 
A4.4.4.  Company A of the 802d Engineer Aviation Battalion (EAB) was the first Aviation Engineer
unit to land in Korea, coming from Okinawa. Beginning on 11 July 1950, engineers rehabilitated the
airfield at Pohang, using World War II-vintage equipment. They put a 500-foot PSP extension on the
east end of the runway and constructed a 40-foot wide taxiway with 27 hardstands for P-51 Mustangs.
In early August, the engineers left their equipment and joined the infantry to defend the base against
advancing North Korean troops. 
A4.4.5.  The 822d EAB arrived from Okinawa on 30 July with orders to repair the existing PSP run-
way without hindering current air operations and mission generation at Taegu Airfield. It had one sod
runway, 4,000 feet long. Working around the clock, engineers, aided by 500 Korean workers, laid
4,300 linear feet of a new PSP runway and went to work on the existing parallel runway . On 16
August, North Korean forces attacked Tageu forcing the EAG to evacuate to Pusan. Returning a
month later, the engineers completed the runway to a length of 6,215 feet with a 1,000-foot stabilized
overrun. This allowed F-80 jet aircraft and heavy C-119 transports to use the airfield. The 811th EAB
put Kimpo and Suwon airfields back into service just 10 days following the Inchon invasion. This pat-
tern of construction, coming under attack, retreating and having to re-accomplish their work was a
point of constant frustration for EAG personnel. 
A4.4.6.  During the early stages of the Korean War, the low level of readiness of the SCARWAF avi-
ation engineer units seriously affected the conduct of air operations. This problem was compounded
by the introduction of several new aircraft. Newer aircraft such as the F-80 and C-124 required longer
and wider runways, larger taxiways and parking aprons, increased  pavement thickness, and more
stringent design criteria for gradients and clear zones. Larger fuel and munitions storage, and more
support facilities were requirements that added to the burden. The result of the technological advance-
ments in aircraft in Aviation Engineering terms was a much lar ger construction effort required to
expand and support existing and new Korean airfields . In World War II, airfield construction was
expressed in terms of battalion days or weeks; in Korea, it was battalion months. 
A4.4.7.  Other factors contributed to the reduced capabilities of SCARWAF Aviation Engineers dur-
ing the early months of the conflict. Although the Far East Air Forces had 3,600 SCARWAF authori-
zations, only 2,322 were filled, and their equipment consisted of obsolete leftovers from World War II.
These handicaps resulted in concentrating initial construction effort on upgrading South Korean and
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
181
WWII Japanese-built airfields. The newer, heavier and more performance driven aircraft of the
Korean conflict quickly exceeded the design capabilities of the WWII airfields causing degradation,
deterioration and increased maintenance and repair requirements. The Aviation Engineers attempted
to solve the problem by overlaying the thin conc rete surfaces with PSP without addressing the poor
bearing capacity of the runway subgrade. The PSP overlay method was effective to support fighter
operations but collapsed and failed under the weight of transport a nd bombers due to the inadequate
sub grade bearing capacity. Operations had to continue to support combat operations, and as reported
at the time, the PSP “rolled and buckled, clips worked loose and lacerated aircraft tires, while the per-
forated surface slowed the planes and increased the takeoff roll” (Figure A4.15.). 
Figure A4.15.  Damaged PSP Being Repaired. 
A4.4.8.  Since PSP was the only means of providing expedient airfield surfaces, the existing stock (5
million square feet) was soon depleted. By September 1950, with a supplemental shipment of another
5 million square feet, 8.3 million square feet of PSP matting had been laid  in Korea and Japan. By
December 1950, losses as a result of the Chinese Communist Forces offensive and other emergency
requirements had once again depleted PSP supplies. 
A4.4.9.  December 1950 saw the Communist Chinese Forces launch a massive counter offensive over
the Yalu River. By the end of the month UN forces and positions started to retreat and fall. During this
retreat the 822nd EAB working around Pyongyang were forced to retreat. During this action the
822nd lost 75% of its equipment when an ammuni tion rail car exploded incapacitating the rails. By
January 1951, the Chinese Communist Forces advance had been halted and UN forces began to take
the offensive. UNC forces established a static forward battle line along the 38th parallel that became
the main battlefield for the next two years. 
A4.4.10.  As the war entered into this stage, the lack of training, manpower, and worn-out equipment
still plagued the aviation engineer units, severely degrading construction efforts. The acute shortage of
repair parts and mechanics, and equipment abuse by untrained operators further aggravated an already
difficult situation. 
A4.4.11.  The assessment of the e ngineers’ role and accomplishments during the first 2 years of war
was generally disappointing. The official Air Force history of the Korean War stated: “In two years of
182
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
war in Korea no single factor had so seriously handicapped Fifth Air Force operational capabilities as
the lack of adequate air facilities.” 
A4.4.12.  Recognizing the problem of SCARWAF training, all CONUS training was placed under the
control of the Continental Air Command and the Aviation Engineer Force was established. Ten avia-
tion engineer units with a total strength of 3,484 personnel were assigned to Aviation Engineer Force.
The creation of the Aviation Engineer Force was an important first step to correct the training prob-
lems, but it was far short of solving them all. It took 2 years after the start of the war, until June 1952,
for the Fifth Air Force to attain its required aviation engineer capability of 10 battalions. 
A4.4.13.  Considering the many difficulties encountered by SCARWAF units during the conflict, their
many accomplishments are doubly impressive. Duri ng the early stages, Aviation Engineers used
expedient methods to get as many airfie lds operational as possible; it  was the only viable option
because time, manpower, equipment and materials were limited. As the frontlines stabilized in 1951,
and more manpower became available, the effort shifted toward more durable construction methods.
At Taegu, Kunsan, and Suwon 9,000-foot semi-permanent runways were built to last at least 2 years.
From this point on, the construction effort in Korea increased dramatically. By the end of the war, Avi-
ation Engineers had built or repaired 55 separate  airfields from which the Air Force flew nearly
700,000 sorties. 
A4.4.14.  Installation squadrons operated and maintain ed the airfields. The squadron's three of ficers
and 60 enlisted troops, supplemented by 300-400 Korean laborers, constructed prefabricated build-
ings, established utility systems, and provided fire protection. Working in concert with aviation engi-
neer battalions, the installation squadrons transforme d airfields into airbases. Engineers constructed
housing, administrative facilities, operational and maintenance structures at South Korean bases to
support prolonged operations. They also deployed forward to assist in the operation of temporary air-
fields near the front lines during the fluid portion of the war. 
A4.4.15.  Even with lo nger and wider runways, jet aircraft co ntinued to be lost during takeoff and
landing operations. The Air Force decided to test the application of an aircraft arresting barrier system
similar to the Davis barri er used on aircraft carriers. The system adopted by the Air Force, the
MA-1A, consisted of retractable stanchions which held the barrier in position and heavy anchor chain
to decelerate the aircraft when it engaged the barrier (Figure A4.16.). In the first two weeks of use at
Taegu, three F-84s (costing $200,000 each) were saved by the arresting system, which cost $17,000.
Within six months of operation, the MA-1A had saved 36 aircraft through active engagements.

A4.4.16.  Problems relating to heavy equipment centered around lack of standardization and, at least
during the early stages of the c onflict, operator training. Equipment obsolescence and insufficient
replacement parts presented difficulties as well. 
A4.4.17.  Training deficiencies in the SCARWAF units posed a ma jor problem throughout the con-
flict. Once the Aviation Engineer Force had trained ten of the rotational uni ts, proficiency improved
considerably. In its after action report, the Aviation Engineer Force concluded “...the Air Force had a
vital need for aviation forces which were not combat engineers nor construction engineers but special-
ists in the art of building airfields.” 
A4.4.18.  Following the war, the Air Force requested permission to organize its own engineering func-
tion and transfer the 30,000 SCARWAF engineers from the Army. In 1955, however, the Secretary of
Defense decided to leave the engineers with the Army and abolish the SCARWAF, thus leaving the
Air Force without its own combat engineers until the estab lishment of the RED HORSE program in
1965. 
A4.5.  A Professional Force. The 1950s were a period of significant growth in the basing of the Air Force.
The elevation of the Directorate of Installations to Assistant Chief of Staff level from 1954 to 1957 was
indicative of the increased engineering activities related to the massive strategic forces buildup. 
A4.5.1.  With the beginning of operational planning for the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),
the civil engineering activity was reorganized to provide for de sign and construction supervision of
missile ground support facilities. The designer of the missile ground environment had to work in an
integrated fashion with the designer of the missile itself. When the ICBM became a part of the aero-
space force, it automatically introduced engineering considerations as a major element for the se lec-
tion and employment of weapon systems and resulted in an incr ease in the scope and volume of Air
Force engineering. The construction of dispersed missile sites at va rious bases presented significant
difficulties in the areas of operations, maintenance and fire protection. 
A4.5.2.  The design and construction of the Dye radar sites, Ballis tic Missile Early Warning System
and Distant Early Warning Line (Figure A4.17.) installations presented many challenges. Extending
from Greenland to Alaska, these sites were constructed under conditions that had never before been
encountered and required ingenuity and perseverance to complete. 
184

A4.5.3.  In 1954, Air Force engineers began construction of the new Air Force Academy near Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado. The Ai r Force Academy Construction Agen cy was created to oversee the
work. The new institution reflected the role that aeros pace power would play in the future ( Figure
A4.18.). 
Figure A4.18.  Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado 
A4.5.4.  Air Force Engineer leaders stressed professionalism and registration in the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1959, the Air Force Director of Installations was renamed the Director of Civil Engineering. At the
base level, Air Installation Officers became Installation Engineers (and later, Base Civil Engineers).
This demonstrated the change in the perception of Air Force Engi neers from “handymen” to profes-
sionals. 
A4.6.  Southeast Asia Conflict. In the 1960s, Air Force Engineers responded to several emergencies and
the growing American commitment in Southeast Asia and as a result, gave the Air Force the contingency
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
185
capability necessary to respond worldwide. The Lebanon crisis of 1958, Berlin crisis of 1961, and Cuban
Missile Crisis of 1962 demonstrated a need for mobile civil engineer teams ready for immediate deploy-
ment to perform construction work during wartime or other emergencies. A HQ USAF study group rec-
ommended that Prime BEEF (base engineer emergency force) teams be created to respond worldwide
when needed. 
A4.6.1.  As the Indochina War ended with the depa rture of French forces, Communist activities in
Southeast Asia started to gain the attention of the United States. By late 1961, the insurgency in the
Republic of South Vietnam began to threaten the country's continued existence. A decision was made
to increase the US military advisory contingent. The buildup of personnel and equipment drove a con-
current requirement for new construction. Some PACAF civil engineers were deployed on temporary
duty (TDY) to Vietnam to establish tent camps and basic support facilities as interim measures until
permanent facilities could be constructed by cont ract. Other civil engineers on TDY also provided
operations and maintenance support at several locations in Sout h Vietnam. The US Military Assis-
tance Command, Vietnam (USMACV) had initial responsibility for contract construction that then
shifted to the Navy. As the construction effort continued to grow, the in-country contractor capability
was soon saturated, while pressure to get the work done increased constantly. After President
Johnson's statement on 4 August 1964 that the US would honor its commitment to South Vietnam, the
US buildup of forces in Southeast Asia started to shift into high gear. The number of Air Force person-
nel and aircraft deployed to Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa, and Da Nang soon saturated these air bases. As
a later study would show, the Army, as required by Department of Defense (DOD) Directive, had no
dedicated units to meet Air For ce troop construction requirements in an overseas theater . The Air
Force, prohibited by that same directive from having its own wartime capability, had to rely on civil-
ian contractors to provide its facilities for combat mission support. 
A4.6.2.  New bases became operational as the buildu p continued, but the flow  of CE forces did not
keep pace, at least not until 1966. The BCEs relied on indigenous labor to provide beddown facilities
for the incoming forces. Billets were not standardized and ranged from hardback tents to “Bien Hoa”
huts, or whatever could be put together quickly with the skills available. Billeting was a minor prob-
lem compared to the constantly increasing challenges that confronted the BCEs. Water shortages in
the dry season followed by floods during the monsoons; sanitation hazards; heavy demands on power
generation and utilities, maintenance of aircraft barrier systems; and daily flightline emergencies were
some of the major concerns. Becau se of the climatic effect on equipment and temporary facilities,
constant maintenance became a heavy burden. During the Vietnam War, firefighters formed Pedro
units, comprising airborne firefighters who responded to crash scenes away from a base. Air Force fire
protection in Southeast Asia was the busiest fire protection organization in the world, responding to
nearly 100,000 emergency calls a year. 
A4.6.3.  While CE forces had received no specific wa r fighting training prior to their Southeast Asia
assignment, they nevertheless demonstrated the capability that was necessary to support the combat
mission until better capabilities could be develope d. The Prime BEEF program implemented in late
1964 was to fill the need; it was put to the test just a few months later. 
A4.6.4.  Lack of parking space and a rapid buildup in numbers made it necessary to park aircraft close
together on existing ramps. The absence of shelters, with only a few protective revetments available,
made aircraft highly vulnerable to accidental explosions and enemy attack. In May 1965, at Bien Hoa,
the inevitable happened when a bomb accidentally exploded on a B-57 parked among a cluster of air-
craft (Figure A4.19.). The sympathetic detonations that followed killed or injured 105 personnel and
186
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
destroyed or damaged 45 aircraft. Some form of protection from a similar accident or enemy action
had to be found. 
Figure A4.19.  B-57s Damaged and Destroyed, Bien Hoa Vietnam. 
A4.6.5.  After prototype testing at Eglin AFB, Florida, the Air Force decided on a steel bin revetment
filled with compacted soil to provide the needed protection. Unable to obtain engineer support from
the heavily committed Army to meet Air Force requirements (including revetment construction), three
CONUS-based, 28-person Prime BEEF teams were deployed to construct revetments at Bien Hoa,
Tan Son Nhut, and Da Nang. This group of three teams was known as Prime BEEF I. By the time their
120-day TDY ended in December 1965, Prime BEEF I had many accomplishments to their credit,
including more than 12,000 linear feet of revetment constructed at three bases ( Figure A4.20.). Not
only had they provided greater protection for combat aircraft, these teams validated the Prime BEEF
concept. Wartime necessity had given Air Force Civil Engineers a war fighting capability. 
A4.6.6.  Other groups of  Prime BEEF teams follo wed to accomplish vital mi ssion support projects.
Prime BEEF II, an 18-person plumbi ng team laid over 2 miles of water lines at T an Son Nhut; pro-
vided nine latrines and constructed sewer mains, septic tanks, and leaching fields. 
A4.6.7.  Prime BEEF III arrived in October 1965; composed of six teams with a total strength of 225
men, these teams were tasked to support the beddown of new Air Force units. Working with BCEs at
various bases, each of these deployments was a success that attracted the attention of the leadership.
By 1968, over 1,600 personnel from nearly 60 individual Prime BEEF teams had responded to support
urgent facility requirements in Southeast Asia.

Figure A4.20.  Aircraft A-2 Bin Revetments, Vietnam Era. 
A4.6.8.  A more permanent capability was required to meet the heavy construction and repair capabil-
ity supporting the rapid force buildup in Southeast Asia. On 10 May 1965, Secretary of Defense Rob-
ert McNamara asked Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert if the Air Force had the capability
to construct expeditionary airfields and, if not, what could be done to develop such a capability. In
August 1965 the organization of Civil Engineering Squadrons (Heavy Repair) was proposed and two
squadrons were requested for assignment to PACAF. The mortar attack on Bien Hoa during may 1965,
when 11 aircraft were damaged, intensified the concern and need for a greater organic capability. One
month after the proposal was made, the T actical Air Command was tasked to or ganize, train, equip,
and prepare two squadrons for deployment to S outh Vietnam. Called Rapid Engineer Deployable
Heavy Operational Repair Squadron, Engineerin g (RED HORSE), these squadrons were to be
self-contained units with their own equipment and supplies, capable of deploying anywhere in the
world. RED HORSE squadrons were to maintain their own identity when operating in the field. 
A4.6.9.  The first two units were  designated the 554th (Penny Short) and the 555th (Triple Nickel)
Civil Engineering Squadrons, Heavy Repair (CES [HR]). By 15 December 1965, training of these
units was underway at Cannon AFB, New Mexico; “graduation” took place on 26 January 1966. Even
before training was completed, all of the 390 items of construc tion equipment to support the two
squadrons were ready for shipment at the Gulfport, Mississippi port of embarkation; it was an extraor-
dinary feat accomplished in just 85 days  after Warner Robins Air Materiel Area had been tasked to
provide this equipment. 
A4.6.10.  The two RED HORSE Squadrons arrived in South Vietnam in February 1966 with the 554th
assigned to Phan Rang AB and the 555th going to Cam Ranh Bay. 
A4.6.11.  The 554th at fi rst concentrated on repair of the aluminum matting runway where severe
rains and poor initial construction had caused the subbase to fail. Repair was accomplished by exca-
vating to depths of up to 8 feet and replacing subgrade material, installing sub drains, and laying new
base course material. The work proceeded without interruption of air operations. Later the 554th built
aircraft shelters, shops and other support structures, constructed NAVAID facilities and taxiways, and
installed aircraft arresting barriers. 
A4.6.12.  The 555th RED HORSE Squadron performed similar ta sks to maintain continued flying
operations at Cam Ranh Bay; they were also ac tive in new facility construction and improvement of
roads and the utility systems. 
188

Figure A4.21.  RED HORSE Engineers at Tuy Hoa Beach. 
A4.6.13.  By the end of 1966, six RED HORSE units had been organized and deployed to SEA. The
556th arrived at U Tapao AB, Thailand, at the beginning of July 1966 and engaged primarily in build-
ing construction. Members of the squadron also completed work at five other bases in Thailand. The
819th’s role in Vietnam was unique among RED HORSE squadrons in that it deployed to an undevel-
oped area, classified as unsecured, to establish a base camp without recourse to any base support func-
tions. The mission of the squadron  was to construct the buildings at Phu Cat while the construction
combine of Raymond International, Morrison-Knudsen, Brown and Root, and J.A. Jones (RMK/BRJ)
constructed the airfield. Phu Cat became the one base in South Vietnam at which almost all building
construction and a great percentage of earthen and paving construction was accomplished by a RED
HORSE squadron—the 819th. The 820th deployed to Tuy Hoa AB in October 1966. This unit com-
pleted nearly 50 percent of all construction completed at Tuy Hoa, including: 170 aircraft protective
revetments, 120,000 square feet of wooden buildings, and 175,000 square yards of AM-2 matting. In
addition, the 820th operated a rock  crusher 9.5 miles from the base  and hauled aggregate through
enemy-held territory to the base. The 823d reported to Bien Hoa AB in October 1966. Operating out
of Bien Hoa, the squadron reorganized into four self-sufficient units. By January 1967, deployed units
were in place at Tan Son Nhut, Vung Tau, Da Nang, and Pleiku, while a unit remained at Bien Hoa. 
A4.6.14.  As the many RED HORSE  squadrons were beginning to prove their capabilities as a war
fighting engineering force, they were organized into the 1st Civil Engineering Group directed by the
7th Air Force Civil Engineer. These squadrons carried out major c onstruction on several bases and
completed much of the vertical work left undone  by the contractors. RED HORSE squadrons con-
structed nearly 400 concrete aircraft shelters at six bases in South Vietnam between 1967 and 1969.
The RED HORSE squadrons succeeded in making the bases safer and much more livable for Air
Force personnel. 
A4.6.15.  The first RED HORS E units deployed to Southeast Asia for 1-year tours. However, there
was no program for training replacem ent personnel for the initial cadre. In 1966, T actical Air Com-
mand established the Civil Engineering Field Activi ties Center at Eglin Auxiliary Field #2 and acti-
vated the 560th RED HORSE Squadron to operate  the site. The 560th, comprised primarily of
returning “Horsemen,” conducted 60 days of academic and field tr aining for RED HORSE replace-
ment personnel. The hot, humid climate at Eglin Auxiliary Field #2 made it an ideal training site for
Southeast Asia-bound personnel. Also, the isolated site allowed the training cadre to establish a “typ-
ical” Southeast Asia RED HORSE camp away from the main base. When RED HORSE requirements
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
189
in Southeast Asia began to scale back, the training was no longer required. The Civil Engineering
Field Activities Center closed in January 1970 after training over 5,000 personnel. 
A4.6.16.  At the peak of activity, RED HORSE in-theater strength reached 2,400 military personnel
and 6,000-plus host nation personnel. In 1969 the workload for RED HORSE decreased, and some
units were inactivated or redeployed to other locations, leaving two squadrons in South Vietnam by
the end of 1970. 
A4.6.17.  In 1966, the Air Force was increasing its daily missi ons in support of the buildup of US
ground forces in Southeast Asia. The Air Force had several squadrons of aircraft ready for deploy-
ment to South Vietnam. However, existing bases were loaded to the saturation point and building an
additional base posed other problems. The constr uction capability of both the Army and Navy was
already overburdened, as was the existing civilian construction combine, RMK/BRJ. 
A4.6.18.  The Air Force responded with Project T urnkey, a concept for constructing a new base in
minimum time. Project Turnkey was a single package wh ereby the new base would be brought to
combat operational status in just 7 months, with the complete air base to be finished within 12 months.
This was a new experience for the Air Force, because it had never had sole responsibility for the con-
struction of an operational air base. 
A4.6.19.  The site chosen for the new air base was on the coast, near the village of Tuy Hoa. The initial
operational facility included a 9,000 foot runway  of AM-2 matting, a taxiway, parking apron,
pre-packaged tent facilities, and bladder systems for petroleum storage. This was followed by con-
struction of sustained operational facilities to include a parallel 9,500-foot concrete runway, plus
maintenance, cantonment, and operational facilities. 
A4.6.20.  The first shipments of construction supplies came in over the beach and were off-loaded by
Filipino stevedores using landing craft. All of the contractor  camp facilities were erected in their
planned permanent locations for later Air Force use. 
A4.6.21.  A major part of the construction effort was first directed toward completion of the aluminum
mat runway so that operational status could be achieved at the earliest possible date. By early October,
the first sections of aluminum matting could be placed in position. Mat emplacement proceeded at a
rate of 600-800 feet of runway per day. Simultaneously, construction was expedited on all basic facil-
ities required for the interim operation of the ba se. The aluminum mat runway was finished by 12
November 1966, a full 6 weeks ahead of the projected completion date. On that same day the new Tuy
Hoa runway received its first aircraft, an Air Force C-130 and a C-124. These transports brought in the
ground control approach mobile unit and other navigational aids required for use of the runway. Three
days later, F-100s of the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to their new home at Tuy Hoa. 
A4.6.22.  The engineers then turned their attention to the construction of a concrete runway, concrete
taxiway, and the base permanent facilities. As F-100s took off from the AM-2 runway on daily mis-
sions, paving operations on the parallel runway moved forw ard at an accelerated pace (Figure
A4.22.). Working both day and night, the paving crews were able to complete the concrete runway by
6 April—a full month ahead of schedule.

Figure A4.22.  Vietnamese Civilians Helping Build Tuy Hoa Parallel Runway. 
A4.6.23.  Simultaneously, the 820th RED HORSE Squa dron also worked around the clock to com-
plete all of the sustained operationa l facilities. By June 1967, the entire air base was finished. Air
Force civil engineers had proven that when necessary they could assume responsibility for the con-
struction of an operational air base and complete it successfully. 
A4.6.24.  In the middle of the Vietnam effort, Prime BEEF teams and the 557th RED HORSE Squad-
ron deployed to South Korea in response to the ra pid force buildup following the seizure of the USS
Pueblo on 23 January 1968. These units constructed aircraft shelters, modular facilities, revetments,
and other mission essential facilities to support the additional flying units in the country. 
A4.6.25.  During the period of rapid expansion, the civil engineering war fighting capability had tran-
sitioned from virtually no capabili ty to a viable, battle-tested capability represented by its Prime
BEEF teams and RED HORSE squadrons. W e cannot fail to mention the dedicated legions of engi-
neers who, during their year-long tours in Southeast Asia, operated and maintained the airbases. They
may get little glory, but they were an essential force to help keep the aircraft flying. 
A4.6.26.  As American involvement in Southeast Asia began to wind down, RED HORSE capabilities
were maintained at a high level of readiness. For the first time, the Air Force had organic heavy repair
units designed for contingency support with no contingency at hand. In an effort to provide an engi-
neer heavy repair capability as responsive and quickly deployed as the tactical aircraft they support, a
training program was developed which produced ta ngible results by completing civil engineering
projects which developed skills similar to those which would be required during a contingency. 
A4.6.27.  One such project was the construction of  an aircraft bombing and gunnery range at Blair
Lakes, Alaska. The project consisted of clearing 1,200 acres of forest, construction of personnel quar-
ters, operations and maintenance buildings, and erecti on of observation towers 40 feet in height to
provide a standard range for use by Arctic construction operations. 
A4.7.  A Peacetime Force. In 1975, the Directorate of Engineering and Services was created at HQ USAF
when responsibility for mortuary affairs, housing, housing furnishings, bachelor quarters, and transient
quarters transferred to the Directorate of Engineering. Other Services functions such as food service were
transferred in 1979 when the Air Force Services Office moved from the Defense Personnel Support Cen-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
191
ter, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to HQ Air Force Engineering and Services Center (AFESC), Tyndall
AFB, Florida. 
A4.7.1.  In 1978, Services personnel began work on the Prime RIBS (readiness in base services) pro-
gram to give the Services fiel d a contingency capability for feeding, housing, and clothing deployed
troops. By using a building block concept similar to Prime BEEF, the Prime RIBS teams provided the
necessary flexibility to respond to a variety of situations. The Air Force now had the capability to sup-
port troops properly in the field. 
A4.7.2.  Air Force civil engineers assisted local communities recovering from natural disasters. Prime
BEEF and RED HORSE teams resp onded in Northeastern Pennsylvania and Rapid City, South
Dakota, to help in the search, rescue, and recovery operations following severe flooding. A tornado
devastated Xenia, Ohio, in 1974.  Engineers and firefighters from  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio,
assisted in the cleanup and helped put out many fires caused by gas leaks.  In 1979, the 823rd RED
HORSE Squadron assisted in rec overy operations at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, which had been
heavily damaged by Hurricane Frederick. More recently, Air Force civil engineers helped residents in
recovery efforts following Hurricanes Andrew, Isabel, and Katrina. 
A4.7.3.  Protection and restoration of the envir onment became a major concern for Air Force Engi-
neers in the 1970s. Responsibility for the Air Forc e environmental protection program was given to
the Directorate of Engineering and Services. Terms such as Environmental Impact Statement, Instal-
lation Restoration, and pollution abatement became a part of the everyday language for Air Force civil
engineers. 
A4.7.4.  Great improvements in the quality of life for Air Force personnel were made in the 1970s .
High priority was given to upgrading housing, recreational facilities, child development centers, and
the workplace. 
A4.8.  Readiness Rebirth. Programs set in motion during the 1960s and 1970s, such as Prime BEEF, RED
HORSE, quality of life improvemen ts, and environmental concerns continued to expand during the
1980s. The 1980s was a period of challenges for Air Fo rce engineers as they found themselves working
on major projects overseas. 
A4.8.1.  Air Force engineers were responsible for th e overall program management for the construc-
tion of two Israeli airbases in the Negev Desert as  part of the Camp David Accords. These projects
presented special challenges because of the for eign government construction standards and the
demanding construction schedule. 
A4.8.2.  Off-station Prime BEEF team training had its beginnings at  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.
That training, which developed limited beddown skills, moved to Tyndall AFB, Florida in 1972 with
its parent unit, the Air Force Civil Engineering Center, the forerunner to today's Air Force Civil Engi-
neer Support Agency (AFCESA). 
A4.8.3.  In 1979, HQ AFESC (now HQ AFCESA) relocat ed the Prime BEEF training to Field #4 at
Eglin AFB, Florida. The runways at Field #4 enabled civil engineers to learn rapid runway repair
(later known as airfield damage repair or ADR) as never before—on blown craters, and ADR became
the focus. Prime BEEF team members also received some hands-on training in bomb damage repair,
force beddown, Harvest Eagle equipment, chemical warfare defense, and explosive ordnance recon-
naissance. In October 1985, a major change occurred. The Prime BEEF contingency training con-
ducted at Field #4 was greatly expanded to include other specialties. The new base recovery after
192
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
attack (BRAAT) training combined the traditional Prime BEEF curricula with those of the dis aster
preparedness (later called Emergency Management, or EM), explosive ordnance disposal, firefight-
ing, services, and commissary specialties. They learned how their individual functional areas interface
for a coordinated base recovery effort. For 7 days, students trained and exercised together in a realistic
wartime environment. 
A4.8.4.  Air Force Engineers were given the opportunity to display their capabilities during SALTY
DEMO, an integrated air base survivability demonstration conducted in May 1985 at Spangdahlem
AB, Germany. For 5 days, the Engineers were involved in almost every aspect of BRAAT. The dem-
onstration opened a lot of eyes and focused attenti on on the importance of the air base and the engi-
neers' role in air base recovery and sortie generation. 
A4.9.  Gulf War. Air Force Engineers played a vital role during the Gulf War. Beginning on 7 August
1990, thousands of men and women began deploying to Southwest Asia in support of Operation DESERT
SHIELD/DESERT STORM—the largest movement of combat forces since World War II. US Air Force
personnel initially deployed to two primary locations, Dhahran and Riyadh. This soon grew to more than
twenty locations in the region, ranging from international airports, to airfields under construction, to mod-
ern military air bases with state of the art facilities. Prime BEEF teams used Harvest Falcon assets to bed-
down deploying forces. Created in th e 1980s, Harvest Falcon is a complete bare ba se set that provides
both housekeeping and aircraft maintenance facilities. It combines aspects of Harvest Eagle and Harvest
Bare and uses soft-wall, and some hard-wall, shelters for base support and hard-wall shelters for aircraft
support. All Harvest Falcon equipment is designed specifically for Southwest Asia operations. 
A4.9.1.  When billeting was unavailable at the sites, as was often the case, everyone went to work set-
ting up "tent city” and no t just the engineers. Although so me Air Force personnel initially were
housed in hotels downtown, the terrorism threat forced them on  base. Soon, rows and rows of tents
blossomed on the Saudi sand. Engineers erected approximately 5,000 tents during Operation
DESERT SHIELD. Many of the bases gave their tent cities names such as "Camel-lot" and "Bedrock
City." 
Figure A4.23.  Erecting a TEMPER Tent (Operation DESERT STORM). 
A4.9.2.  Electrical power was a critical element at all beddown locations, not only for aircraft support
equipment, but for computer operations and air conditioning as well. For bare base operations, the Air
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
193
Force used primarily 60-kW, 100-kW, and 750-kW generators. Early in  the deployment, the smaller
60-kW and 100-kW portable generators provided primary electrical power to small clusters of tents or
facilities. Such improvising required frequent servicing of the equipment and refueling of generators
and often led to generator overload resulting in equipment failure. When they were later replaced or
supplemented by 750-kW diesel generators, most  Air Force power production personnel were unfa-
miliar with the larger units. The problem was compounded by the unavailability of Technical Orders
for the equipment. 
A4.9.3.  Generators began failing because of around-the-clock operations and a severe shortage of fil-
ters and spare parts that reduc ed the amount of scheduled mainte nance that could be accomplished.
The Air Force sent an eight-person civil engineer ing maintenance, inspection, repair, and training
(CEMIRT) team to establish a depot repair cap ability for power production equipment at Thumrait,
Oman. 
A4.9.4.  In August, a shortage of primary distribution centers complicated the establishment of effi-
cient power distribution systems, which resulted in a lack  of safe hookups to the primary electrical
distribution source. By 26 Sept ember 1990, however, the CEMIRT team at Kelly Air Force Base,
Texas, designed an acceptable replacement using co mmercial off-the-shelf components and shipped
the thirty-four primary distribution centers to the Gulf region site s and one to Sheppard Technical
Training Center. 
A4.9.5.  Water availability, its storage, and distribution were critical elements at beddown locations.
USCENTAF Engineering and Services established a minimum secure water storage requirement of
100 gallons per person for 5 days. Drinking water in itially was supplied as bottled water from local
sources, and at some sites, it came from existing water distribution systems connected directly to com-
mercial water sources. Nearly every site had to augment the in-place system. Other locations, such as
Cairo West, had to haul water by truck (Figure A4.24.) and store it in bladders. The quality of water
varied from site to site. A few sites only needed to add a small am ount of chemicals to bring it up to
standards. Others were required to process it through Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units. Sev-
enteen sites possessed water purification units. 
Figure A4.24.  Hauling Water to Support the Base (Operation DESERT STORM). 
A4.9.6.  Wastewater was collected either to underground storage tanks and pumped out by contractors
or to a gray water pond for evapor ation or absorption. However, soil conditions at some sites were a
194
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
clay/sandy soil with a hard sandstone subbase that did not permit absorption, and high humidity
slowed evaporation. Engineers constructed lagoon systems to pipe the gray water furt her from the
cantonment area and reduce the potential health hazard. 
A4.9.7.  Air Force Civil Engineers had to overcome many obstacles. Most engineers had never trained
on the set up of Harvest Falcon equipment, and when TEMPER tents and utility systems began to
arrive, many without technical orders, the engineers were uncertain exactly what constituted a com-
plete set, how they were to be assembled, or how to repair the equipment. Furthermore, the delivery of
Harvest Falcon equipment was del ayed, parts were missing, shippi ng containers inappropriately
marked, and in some cases, equipment was appropria ted by organizations other than the consigned.
War Readiness Spares Kits (WRSK) for several Harvest Falcon items often did not accompany the
delivery or were incomplete because of funding. Inevitably, the most critical items were missing from
the kits. Filters for generators were scarce, and e ngineers resorted to using T-shirts or panty hose.
Spares shortages forced operators to “abuse” their equipment. Many generators, for example, operated
for sixteen maintenance cycles without any routine maintenance. 
A4.9.8.  Engineers’ accomplishments the first days and weeks of the deployment were noteworthy.
The following is a summary of a Prime BEEF team ’s first month’s work at King Fahd International
Airport, Saudi Arabia: The group accomplishments included laying over 4,000 tons of asphalt for
roads, parking, Air Transportable Hospital, helicopter pads, and chow halls. We erected over 370
tents, set up 6 shower units, 10 latrines, a camp potable water and electric distribution system, a camp
revetment system, designed and installed a bunker system, provided wood floors for admin/shop tents,
constructed a mall complex consisting of a chapel, BX, movie tents, recreation center, laundry, and
personnel facility. We have sectionalized the base for bomb damage repair purposes and set in place
the teams to conduct those operations. We set up our own logistics ope ration to acquire material and
tools we could not obtain elsewhere for which we continue to rely on for 100 percent of our support. 
A4.9.9.  Firefighters established a fire protection capability by assembling vehicles, equipment, and
firefighting agent (halon, dry chemical, and aqueous film-forming foam). They assessed the fire pro-
tection requirements of the site, evaluated the host nation capabilities, and assisted engineers in plan-
ning site layouts. 
A4.9.10.  Their vehicles arrived from prepositioned storage sites in theater, some from European War
Reserves Materiel storage and one from Korea. Many of them were not operational; arriving with bro-
ken pumps, dry-rotted fan belts and hoses, and few tools, hoses, or firefighting agent. Firefighting
agent was not prepositioned and did not come with the vehicles. Empty prepositioned Flightline fire
extinguishers had to be refilled on the local economy at a much higher cost. Firefighters also encoun-
tered problems with the connection required to service halon tanks on vehicles, since the threads of
US-made vehicles did not mat ch British-made equipment and required fabrication of connectors.
Throughout the deployment, nearly all sites relied to some extent on host nation firefighting assistance
whose capabilities varied from site-to-site. In the early weeks, Air Force firefighters often shared
facilities and equipment with host nation firefighters. 
A4.9.11.  Engineers from the 823d and 820th RED HORSE Civ il Engineering Squadrons began
deploying in late September 1990. Soon the Air Force had a strong engineering capability available in
theater. They broke up into sm aller teams and spread throughout  the region performing major con-
struction work at numerous sites.

A4.9.12.  In November, when President George Bush ordered additional forces to the Persian Gulf
region to provide an offensive capability, Air Force operations expanded at several bases with addi-
tional planes and personnel. As many sites stretched to maximum capacity, Lieutenant General
Charles A. Horner, USCENTAF Commander, requested additional aircraft basing at existing sites and
dispersed airpower assets by opening additional bases. For engineers this meant another push to bed-
down deploying forces. This time, however, support forces prepared the support structure for the
arriving forces. Nearly every existing base added blocks of tents, erected bathhouses, and assembled
aircraft hangars, general-purpose (GP) shelters, and weapons storage areas. 
A4.9.13.  RED HORSE engineers tackled larger and heavier jobs such as parking ramps and taxiways.
At Shaikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain, the project called for constructing: two concrete hardstands, (550 by
204 feet and 450 by 240 feet), groundi ng points, 100-foot wide asphalt taxi ways around each hard-
stand, and constructing a 100 by 3,200-foot asphalt taxiway running parallel to the northern side of the
south loop. They erected 36 revetments for the inco ming aircraft. At Al Minhad Air Base, they con-
structed a 390-foot by 1,050-foot concrete and asphalt parking apron for an additional F-16 squadron.
At Jeddah, the Prime BEEF engi neers moved more than 150,000-cubic-yards of earth and created
more than 400,000-square-feet of weapons storage area. The availability of a large-scale construction
industry in the region enabled Air Force engineers to complete this type of work on time by contract-
ing it out or by leasing equipment. 
A4.9.14.  To put more aircraft closer to the Kuwaiti border, General Horner directed his engineers to
open two new sites in Saudi Arabia . The first, about 60 miles south of Riyadh near the town of Al
Kharj, had been programmed as a massive Saudi military installation, but only a runway, taxiway, and
parking apron had been constructed. This project presented one of the biggest challenges facing Air
Force engineers during the war. On 12 November 1990, RED HORSE accepted overall responsibility
for construction, and the 4th Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) and other engineering personnel would
augment them. The 4th CES would operate and maintain the base after completion. On 25 November,
RED HORSE, Prime BEEF, and contractor personnel went to work. The engineers compacted more
than 200,000 cubic yards of red clay to serve as the foundation for a tent city. Eventually, 630 TEM-
PER tents, 4 kitchens, a gymnasi um, 21 latrines, and 26 shower a nd shave units were erected. They
constructed a sanitary system, and a power plan t of seventeen 750-kW generators, assembled an
air-transportable hospital, and built six K-span structures. Al Kharj was ready for aircraft in early Jan-
uary 1991, and by the beginning of the war, the base was home to 4,900 Air Force personnel (Figure
A4.25.). 
196

Figure A4.25.  Al Kharj Tent City (Prince Sultan Air Base), DESERT STORM. 
A4.9.15.  At the same time, another RED HORSE team was busy building a forward operating loca-
tion only 50 miles from the Iraqi border at King Khalid Military City, Saudi Arabia. This was initially
planned as a small, 800-person site with a quick turn-around capability for aircraft flying missions to
Iraq and Kuwait and to recover damaged aircraft. This required the instal lation of aircraft arresting
barriers and an expanded fire response capability. The base continued to expand until it reached a pop-
ulation of 1,650 in mid-January and nearly 2,000 in February 1991. 
A4.9.16.  One of the outstanding engineeri ng accomplishments of the war was the construction of
over 5 miles of revetment at King  Fahd. The effort paid dividends when a missile on a parked A-10
accidentally fired into a revetment wall. The earth-filled revetment stopped the missile and prevented
damage to aircraft parked nearby. 
A4.9.17.  Air Force civil engineers also deployed to Turkey, Spain, the Indian Ocean, England, Ger-
many, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and within the United S tates. Torrejon Air Base, Spain, and
Rhein Main Air Base, Germany, served as major transit bases for deploying to and from Southwest
Asia. Rhein Main engineers redesigned the hydrant  system enabling them to double the refueling
capacity by using more trucks over a shorter distance. 
A4.9.18.  Preparations for deployment assumed a feverish pitch throughout many areas of the world.
Engineering teams reopened RAF Fairford, United Kingdom, and Moron Air Base, Spain, to support
flying operations. At Moron, they patched the runway between missions to keep it open during Oper-
ation DESERT STORM. Tankers were bedded down in France, Greece, and Italy. While host nations
supplied the civil engineering suppor t, Air Force firefighters deploy ed to provide crash and rescue
operations for the aircraft. In the United Kingdom, engineers opened World War II-era contingency
hospitals at Nocton Hall, Bicester, and Little Rissington, where water storage capabilities had to be
supplemented with bladders. 
A4.9.19.  In December 1990, the civil engineer fo rces in Europe began de ploying to bases in Tur-
key—Operation PROVEN FORCE. At Incirlik AB, Turkey, a seventeen-member Prime BEEF team
from Ramstein AB, Germany, quietly worked inside a warehouse, ordering supplies and pre-assem-
bling tent floors. When the T urkish government granted approval on 16 January, engineers, aircraft
crews, and other support personnel deployed to Incirlik. The engineers constructed “Tornado Town”
and helped bed down deployed personnel. 
A4.9.20.  When Operation DESERT STORM began, civil engineers at the sites were ready—equip-
ment and materials were dispersed, personnel and structural protection was complete. Firefighters
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
197
assumed 12-hour shifts to support coalition Air Forces with fire protection for integrated combat turns
with hot pit refueling operations. As combat sorties increased, so did the in-flight and ground emer-
gencies, barrier engagements, and malfunctioning ordnance responses. Firefighters also extinguished
fires on armed aircraft with a variety of problems caused by battle damage. At King Khalid Military
City, the firefighters responded to 157 in-flight emergencies and 785 integrated combat-turn standbys
during Operation DESERT STORM. 
A4.9.21.  For the United States Army Patriot batteries at Riyadh Air Base, King Khalid International
Airport, and near Eskan Village, RED HORSE personnel constructed security berms. They rigged
front-end loaders to assist in reloading batteries, reducing the reload time from 45 to 5 minutes. The
Air Force also provided electricity to Patriot batteries at Riyadh and Shaikh Isa Air Bases. On 17 Jan-
uary 1991, the 820th deployed to Ki ng Khalid Military City to complete the integrated combat-turn
project abandoned by the contractor. 
A4.9.22.  In the days before the formal cease-fire, a joint RED HORSE-Explosive Ordnance Disposal
team tackled the most challenging post-war project on 26 February, when General Horner tasked them
to deny two airbases in southeastern Iraq to any future use by returning Iraqi forces. On 6 March 1991,
two teams of engineers arrived at Tallil and Jaliba Air Bases in  Iraq. At Tallil, RED HORSE used
approximately 80,000 pounds of explosives, c onsisting primarily of 40-pound shape charges and
MK-82, 500-pound bombs, to make cuts in the ru nway and taxiway every 2,000 feet. At Jaliba Air
Base, the engineers denied a concrete runway and two parallel asphalt taxiways, with 27 cuts (72 cra-
ters up to 40 feet wide and 12 feet deep) in the pavement. Only 4 days later, on 10 March 1991, the
final members of the team were aboard CH-47 helicopters returning to Saudi Arabia. When they were
finished, the engineers concluded that it would cost less to build a new base than to clean up and repair
the denied bases. 
A4.9.23.  During the Gulf War, more than 3,000 Air Force engineers bedded down 55,000 personnel
and 1,200 aircraft at nearly 30 sites. They erected 5,000 tents and constructed 300,000 square feet of
buildings. They demonstrated they can provide a good living and working environment to support the
projection of air power around the world. 
A4.9.24.  Unlike previous wars or conflicts, civil engineers did not increase in numbers to support the
war. Consequently, many CONUS base civil engineers had to provid e essentially the same pre-war
level of support to their home bases, but with no increase in manpower. 
A4.9.25.  Engineers also assisted in humanitarian efforts. Following the war, engineers deployed to
Turkey and Iraq to help feed and shelter Ku rdish refugees during Operation PROVIDE COMFORT.
In 1992, both Prime BEEF and RED HORSE personnel traveled to Somalia to “Restore Hope” for the
people there. 
A4.10.  Organizational Changes. The 1990s launched a period of consider able change, and opportunity,
for Air Force civil engineers. In February 1991, the Directorate of Engineering and Services was
realigned directly under the Chief of Staff and re-designated as The Civil Engineer, an Assistant Chief of
Staff. This ended a 13-year tenur e under the Deputy Chief of S taff, Logistics and Engineering and
returned Engineering and Services to the or ganizational level of the 1950s when it was known as the
Assistant Chief of Staff, Installations. 
A4.10.1.  Later in 1991, the 16-year union between E ngineering and Services was ended when Ser-
vices merged with Morale, Welfare, and Recreation. As Services was leaving, the Explosive Ordnance
198
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Disposal and Disaster Preparedness functions joined Civil Engineering, bringing essential capabilities
to the Civil Engineer team. 
A4.10.2.  Civil Engineer team training evolved once again in August 1993. The BRAAT training func-
tion, personnel and equipment were moved from Eglin to Tyndall AFB and placed under Air Combat
Command. At the new loca tion, designated the Silver Flag Exercise Site, program emphasis was
adjusted to give increased attention to beddown skills. This change was driven by the most probable
use of Air Force civil engineers in the era following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact threat. 
A4.11.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Prior to the Unite d Kingdom's effort to cope with unexplode d
bombs during the 1940-1941 blitz on London, there is no record  of organized ordnance disposal. In
response to the many bombing raids to which they were subjected, the Royal Air Force formed their first
bomb disposal units. Through many su ccessful experiences, and failures, these personnel became bomb
disposal experts. 
A4.11.1.  The United States EOD program dates back to April of 1941. The United States was not yet
at war, but was actively preparing for that eventuality. Embassy personnel and military observers were
reporting on the actions of warring nations and as the War Department Intelligence Section evaluated
these reports, recommendations were made concerning actions that should be taken by the United
States. One area stood out. Delayed-explosion-bombs were creating havoc in Europe, taking a heavy
toll in lives and industry. It was expected that if the United States entered the war, it would experience
bombing of its cities and industries. As a result, the need for a bomb disposal program in this country
received immediate attention. 
A4.11.2.  In April 1941, the Sc hool of Civilian Defense was or ganized at the Chemical Warfare
School, Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and part of the training was to be bomb disposal. It was later
decided that the Army would train both military and civilian bomb disposal personnel, and the respon-
sibility for bomb disposal was placed under the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. The location of the
Bomb Disposal School was changed from Edgewood Arsenal to the Ordnance Training Center, Aber-
deen Proving Ground, Maryland. 
A4.11.3.  In the interim the Navy, under a directive from the Chief of Naval Operations, instituted a
Mine Disposal School in May of 1941. The school was located in Washington, D.C. and in December
of 1941 was renamed the Navy Bomb Disposal School. In 1947, the Navy was assigned Joint Service
responsibilities for basic bomb disposal training, making the bomb disposal career field one of the ear-
liest joint service career fields established within the DOD. 
A4.11.4.  In 1942 the Royal Air Force started training United States Army Eighth Air Force personnel
in bomb disposal procedures. At the same time, ordnance personnel were also being trained in bomb
disposal techniques in the United States at the Army Bomb Disposal School, Aberdeen Proving
Grounds, Maryland. These personnel supported combat operations in the Middle East, Sicily, and
Italy from April 1943 through March 1944. Their duties included clearing unexploded bombs from
Air Corps installations, clearing enemy ammunition dumps, and safing or disposing of booby traps. 
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
199
Figure A4.26.  EOD Mine Hunt. 
A4.11.5.  In the Pacific Isla nd-hopping campaigns, bomb clearance challenges were numerous and
enormous. Many times bomb disposal was being accomplished simultaneously with airfield recovery
and construction. Bomb disposal personnel moved forward with advancing units using their talents to
reduce the risk from both American and Japanese ordnance. The end of World War II signaled a slow-
down for Army Air Force bomb disposal efforts. With the reduction of military forces during the 1946
to 1950 time frame, the bomb disposal or ganization was cut way back and its personnel scattered
throughout the military. 
A4.11.6.  At the beginning of the Korean conflict, the function was revitalized, and the name Explo-
sive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD, was adopted instead of “bomb disposal” to ensure that al l new
munitions developments were covered. 
A4.11.7.  On 21 May 1951, the Air Force picked up EOD responsibilities and assigned explosive ord-
nance disposal operational duties within the Zone of Interior to Headquarters Air Materiel Command
(HQ AMC). Accordingly, AMC activated its first explosive ordnance disposal squadron, on 16 June
1952, when the 1st Ordnance Squadr on, Aviation, was re-designated as the 1st Explosive Ordnance
Disposal Squadron. The squadron was located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, with an authorized
strength of 11 officers and 65 enlisted. 
A4.11.8.  Combat operations in Vietnam were unique in nature because EOD personnel not only had
to eliminate explosive hazards from conventional weapons systems, they also had to contend with the
ingenious ability of the Viet Cong to acquire dud US bombs and projectiles and emplace them as
mines or booby traps. 
A4.11.9.  EOD’s mission and responsibilities have continued to change and grow from its beginnings
in World War II to Operation DESERT STORM and the present (Figure A4.27.). EOD involvement
in joint and allied operations such as Joint Casualty Resolution Center missions in recovering missing
in action (MIA) airmen in Vietnam and Laos; insertion behind enemy lines to destroy classified com-
ponents of downed United States aircraft; base denial of enemy in stallations; support of intelligence
gathering agencies; protection of the President of the United States and foreign dignitaries; and
cleanup of ordnance storage depot catastrophes in foreign countries, highlight the diversity of EOD
activities used by all levels of the United States government. 
200
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
Figure A4.27.  EOD Preparing to Destroy Unexploded Ordnance. 
A4.11.10.  The Air Force EOD mission is to protect personnel, resources, and the environment from
the effects of hazardous ordnance. Air Force EOD must sustain the capability to disarm unexploded
ordnance delivered or placed by enemy forces, and render safe United States ordnance made danger-
ous by accident or other circumstances. In addition, they are obligated to use their special expertise to
assist federal and civil authorities when called upon in times such as dea ling with terrorist or other
criminal acts, accidents, and found explosive items. 
A4.11.11.  EOD in the United States is a joint service program. Each branch of the service has specific
responsibilities assigned to it by DOD. Some of these responsibilities are unique to one service and
some overlap between two or more services. In 1971, the Navy was designated as the single manager
for all common EOD training and t echnology. Today, training continues to be provided by the
inter-service staff at the Explosive Ordnance Schools located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. 
A4.11.12.  The Air Force EOD program has been managed by several disciplines, including Logistics
and Operations, throughout its history, but has now found a home within the Civil Engineer commu-
nity. There is precedent for this arrangement as well, as it is common with other US and foreign mili-
tary services. 
A4.11.13.  EOD personnel have bu ilt their tradition, through achievements gained in minimizing
potential explosive accidents throughout the years. They are truly a valuable addition to the United
States Air Force Civil Engineer community. 
A4.12.  Disaster Preparedness. The Air Force Disaster Preparedness Program was established in 1965 as
an outgrowth of the Disaster Control program of the 1950s, which had nuclear attack as its primary focus.
The nuclear weapons accidents at Palmares, Spain and Thule Air Base, Greenland and Hurricane Camille
which devastated the Mississippi coast, gave rise to a consolidation of several emergency, peacetime and
wartime related activities into one co mprehensive program. An officer career field was established and
augmented with existing enlisted resources to create the Air Force Disaster Preparedness Program. 
A4.12.1.  As the US involvement in  Southeast Asia grew in the late  1960s, Air Force Disaster Pre-
paredness added to its list of re sponsibilities the need for planning, training for, and conducting con-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
201
ventional attack protective measures. As the Vietnam conflict came to a close, Disaster Preparedness
moved its focus to the growing Soviet and Warsaw Pack threat against NATO. Limited capabilities for
protection against the growing threat of chemical/biological attacks led to an accelerated program in
the mid-1970s to equip and train USAF personnel against the chemical/biological threat. The Disaster
Preparedness career field grew in numbers to meet these added responsibilities. 
A4.12.2.  As attention was focused on Airbase Survivability and Operability in the mid-1980s, Disas-
ter Preparedness programs again expanded to address the many de ficiencies identified during the
SALTY DEMO air base op erability capability demonstration held at Spangdahlem Air Base, Ger-
many. Once again, as attention shifted to potential adversaries in Southwest Asia, Air Force Disaster
Preparedness programs emphasized the importance of training, protective clothing, and equipment for
the eventuality of chemical/biological and conventional attacks. In Operation DESERT STORM,
Disaster Preparedness personnel mobilized and deployed to numerous bases and sites throughout
Southwest Asia to ensure that all Air Force personnel were ready to survive and operate. 
A4.12.3.  Throughout these shifts in threat and as new responsibilities were added, Disaster Prepared-
ness personnel continued to maintain a readiness posture and responded to numerous natural disasters,
nuclear/conventional weapons accidents, incidents, hazardous materials incidents, and aircraft acci-
dents. The Air Force Disaster Preparedness program in the past has ensured that commanders have the
capability to prepare for and respond to all peacetime and wartime threats and hazards. In 2000, a Full
Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) office was established at AF CESA to lead all Air Force-related
efforts, support joint service interests, and provide support to civil authorities. The FSTR program is
designed primarily to support response activities on installations in the United States and overseas.
The program was renamed as Emergency Management in 2006. As the Air Force prepares for the
challenges of the future, CE Readiness and EM programs will continue to provide professional emer-
gency management and airbase operability support to plan, train, equip, and respond to all peacetime
and wartime threats. 
A4.13.  Challenges in Post Cold War Europe. 
A4.13.1.  The Balkans and Operation ALLIED FO RCE (OAF). The breakup of Yugoslavia brought
suppressed ethnic tensions to the surface in the 1990s. Engineers supported US deployments to the
region during Operations DENY FLIGHT, DELIBERATE FORCE and JOINT ENDEAVOR. As a
sign that the Cold War had truly ended, engineers bedded down forces at Tuszla AB, Bosnia-Herze-
govina and Taszar AB, Hungary. Engineers’ work in the Balkans continued throughout the nineties as
the region reached a boiling point in 1999. Although tensions had been present in the region for cen-
turies, the immediate cause of the conflict in Kosovo was Slobodan Milosevic, and his oppression of
the ethnic Albanians there for the preceding decade. Oppression ultimately gave rise to violent oppo-
sition to Serb rule in the formation of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and then to the spiral of violence
that ensued in 1998 and 1999. Civil unrest and Serbian use of force in Koso vo caught international
attention and when negotiations broke down and Serbian troops swept in causing massive civilian dis-
ruption and an impending refuge e crisis, NATO responded with Operation ALLIED FORCE on 24
March 1999. The American and NATO objectives in Kosovo were to stop the killing and achieve a
durable peace that prevents further repression and provides for demo cratic self-government for the
Kosovar people. 
A4.13.2.  Engineers directly s upported the beddown of aircraft  and personnel at bases throughout
Europe. They worked to pr epare RAF Fairford and Moron AB to ho st deploying forces but Aviano
202
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
AB, Italy, was the operation’s main hub of activity. Already hosting added forces for Balkan opera-
tions, the base was soon pac ked with deploying forces. In February 1999, civil engineers from the
86th Civil Engineer Group at Ramstein Air Base  Germany and 52nd Civil Engineer Squadron from
Spangdahlem Air Base Germany be gan assisting the stressed 31st Civil Engineer Squadron at the
bulging Italian base. They constructed a tent city designed to house up to 4,000 troops, resurfaced six
F-16 parking pads and provided high-voltage power feeds for a new substation. In addition, civil engi-
neers, as part of site survey teams, traveled to countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary
to identify potential beddown sites for the “Papa Bear” buildup. USAFE’s Construction and Training
Squadron engineers deployed to several bases to wo rk projects. At Gioia del Colle AB, Italy , they
worked with Spangdahlem’s Prime BEEF troops to construct five parking ramps to reduce the explo-
sive risk from parked A-10s. At Istres AB, France, the CTS team completed a ramp extension in con-
crete and asphalt. 
A4.13.3.  Beginning in April, civil engineers moved to Rinas Airport at Tirana, Albania, to begin Air
Force beddown for Joint Task Force Shining Hope, established to provide immediate humanitarian
relief to more than 450,000 ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing the Province of Kosovo into Albania and
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Both Prime BEEF and RED HORSE e ngineers
deployed to Albania to support not only the humanitarian mission but also the massive air movement
of the Army’s Task Force Hawk. The 823d RED HORSE engineers were tasked with deployment of a
R-1 team to support USAFE operations on 11 April. By 13 April the team had arrived in Ramstein and
was deploying teams forward to Tirana by the next day. 
Figure A4.28.  RED Horse Heavy Equipment Shipping to Tirana, Albania. 
A4.13.4.  Battling the mud at Tirana, 823d RED HORSE engineers replaced a failing C-17 operations
ramp by constructing a new 975’ x 150’ x 18” concrete parking and marshalling area; building a new
987’ concrete taxiway to replace the taxiway destroyed by SHINING HOPE operations; improving
3.5 miles of camp and pe rimeter supply roads; constructing a medical evacuation helicopter opera-
tions pad; completing an upgrade of the power grid for the USAF tent city and installing 100 environ-
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
203
mental control units; constructing a German fuel pad and a US Forces fuel pad; and installing 600’ of
access roads. 
A4.13.5.  Near the end of the conflict, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen ordered the 820th RED
HORSE Squadron to deploy a RH-1 team and two RH-2 teams to  Tirana, Albania, to perform road
and bridge repairs and to complete projects begun by the 823rd RED HORSE Squadron at Rinas Air-
port. For the humanitarian work in Albania, the Joint Staff decided to use the Air Force Contract Aug-
mentation Program (AFCAP). The major project was to construct three tent cities in Albania to house
up to 20,000 refugees in each complex. AFCAP co mpleted Camp Hope and was well under way on
Camp Eagle when hostilities ceased on 10 June. 
A4.13.6.  The remainder of the 823d R-1 team in Ramstein continued to support USAFE operations
through contingency project evaluations, designs, and deployment/reception operations for two addi-
tional 823d R-2 teams that would deploy forward to various other countries. In Hungary, a 94-person
RH-2 team from the 823rd RED HORSE Squadron deployed to Taszar AB to perform airfield repairs.
823d RED HORSE engineers also completed construction and beddown projects in Trapani, Sicily
and Aviano, Italy supporting Operation ALLIED FORCE. In Turkey, 823rd RED HORSE and Prime
BEEF engineers constructed a tent city at Balikesir AB in preparation for a beddown of F-15 aircraft.
However, the war ended on June 10th, before the full force could move to the base. Following the war,
Joint Air Force, Army, and Navy EOD teams were sent to Kosovo to locate and dispose of unexploded
ordnance in the American sector. 
Figure A4.29.  RED HORSE Taxiway Repair Work, Taszar Hungary. 
A4.13.7.  Overall, engineers suppo rted Air Force personnel as they  deployed to 21 expeditiona ry
bases and generated 38,000 sorties without a single combat casualty. 
A4.14.  A New Millennium. The events of 11 September 2001 brought a new emphasis on the expedition-
ary nature of the US Air Force and its ability to  project power anywhere around the world. Engineers at
bases throughout the Air Force suddenly began putting their bases on a wartime footing by constructing
and installing antiterrorist/force protection measures and by preparing base populations to respond to ter-
rorist acts. Within a matter of weeks, active duty, Guard and Reserve civil engineers found themselves
bedding down forces in places such as Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Afghanistan in support of
the Global War on Terrorism. Eventually, more than 2,700 engineers deployed to 13 main bases, mostly in
204
AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008
the Central Command area of responsibility, to support Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), the
American effort to eliminate the terrorist breeding ground in Afghanistan. These bases ranged from aus-
tere sites to well-developed airbases. At one location, operators lived in a hangar without toilets for about
a month before engineers arrived with Harvest Falcon assets to build a tent city. 
A4.14.1.  RED HORSE, firefighte rs, EOD, and Readiness/Emergency Management personnel were
all heavily tasked. At Thumrait AB, Oman, engineers from 20 bases constructed more than 240 TEM-
PER tents, 13 California shelters, 6 latrines, 4 shower/shave facilities, 27 expandable shelter contain-
ers, and 2 power plants in the first 90 days as the mission grew from a tanker to a tanker/bomber base.
Firefighters established two fire stations and placed in service nine special purpose emer gency
response vehicles with associated equipment. In the first 90 days firefighters responded to 49 emer-
gencies at the base. In late September, members of the 2nd CES at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, arrived
at Masirah Island with a 55-person Prime BEEF lead team. Two 25-person teams arrived from Dyess
AFB, Texas and Whiteman AFB, Missouri. By mid- October the team had erec ted three tent cities:
Tent City-1 was an 1,800- person city erected in 7-10 days ; Tent City-2 was a 2,200-person city
erected and completely functional in 60 hours; Tent City-3 was a 1,400-person city completed by
mid-October. 
A4.14.2.  As coalition forces captu red bases in Afghanistan, engineer s were put to the test as they
worked to prepare them to receiv e aircraft and personnel. The country ’s infrastructure was in sham-
bles from years of conflict and neglect. The pounding given the bases by coalition aircraft during OEF
further damaged airfields and surrounding structures. At Mazar-e-Sharif airfield, RED HORSE engi-
neers found a bombed-out runway and no supplies to repair it. The engineers turned to local contrac-
tors using 100-year old practices to fill th e craters. This included p ounding small rocks with hand
tools and pouring boiled tar over the rocks until the craters were filled. Eventually, they were able to
receive a deployable pavement repair system to make more permanent repairs enabling C-17s to use
the base. 
A4.14.3.  The 86th Contingency Response Group from Ramstein AB, Germany, became the first Air
Force team to deploy to Manas Airport, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in December 2001. Prime BEEF, RED
HORSE, and 49th Materiel Maintenance Squadron pe rsonnel helped construct a tent city for 2,200
troops using four 550-person Force Provider sets in 30 days in the dead of winter. They experienced
sub-zero temperatures frequently during the first four weeks of their deployment, with freezing pipes,
boilers, and diesel fuel that gelled. RED HORSE built a fuel storage area for six 50,000-gallon blad-
ders in five days. Truly a coalition base, eight different countries had troops on site, including France,
Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Spain. 
A4.14.4.  As combat operations in Afghanistan wound down, Air Force civil engineers kept busy pre-
paring bases in the CENTCOM AOR for sustained operations in Afghanistan and to set the stage for
Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF). Building faciliti es at bases throughout the region aided in the
preparation for combat. Bedding down personnel and weapons in several countries enabled the Air
Force to provide superb support to the US drive to Baghdad and destruction of the Saddam Hussein
regime. 
A4.14.5.  Although combat operations began on 20 Ma rch 2003, civil engineers had been active
throughout the region for months. Some bases had been used fo r several years under Operation
SOUTHERN WATCH, the patrolling of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq, but additional forces were
headed for the region. Engineers began opening bases in Jordan and Sa udi Arabia and expanding

bases such as Camp Snoopy at Doha International Airport and Al Udeid AB, Qatar, and Ali Al Salem
AB, Kuwait. 
A4.14.6.  On 6 Ja nuary 2003, a 13-person team from the 16th Civ il Engineer Squadron at Hurlburt
Field deployed to Al Udeid to build a combined air operations center for the Joint Special Operations
Air Component. They converted a Frame Supported Tensioned Fabric Shelter warehouse into a facil-
ity with 6,000 square feet of of fice space, intelligence areas, a se nsitive compartmented information
facility, a communications area, and a 5,000-square foot auditorium with live feed projection screens
to track all operations in theater in just 17 days. 
A4.14.7.  Members of the 60 CES,  Travis AFB, California, deployed to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, in
November 2002, just in time for the OIF buildup. Shaikh Isa became home to Air Force and Marines
flying KC-135s and KC-130. As the camp grew from 800 to 2300 personnel, the engineers began con-
struction on a 1600-person hard wall  Expeditionary Village. The number of aircraft also grew to 53
aircraft requiring the engineers to construct a 385,000 square foot expeditionary ramp and later a $20
million ramp, in addition to an Air Force/Marine Joint Operations Center. Engineers at Shaikh Isa AB
developed an expeditionary hydrant loop refueling system using 3,100 feet of six-inch diameter hose
line to provide direct refueling capability to four aircraft parking spots. Constructed in less than 10
days, it provided 1,200 gallons per minute and up to 600 gallons per minute to any one refueling point.
The system accounted for more than 20 percent of all fuel issued during OIF. 
A4.14.8.  US planners ha d envisioned opening a northern front into Iraq from bases in Turkey. Air
Force engineers began work at the first of three bases in Turkey in mid-February as an initial 10-per-
son contingent from the 16th CES at Hurlburt Fiel d deployed to Diyarbakir AB, T urkey, to begin
buildup of a tent city fo r an estimated 7,000 troops. Diyarbakir was slated to be the main northern
operating base in support of operations against Iraq, if the Turkish government granted permission for
the US to stage operations from its  soil. However, the Turkish Parliament’s approval to permit the
deployment of up to 64,000 American  troops to Turkish bases failed to garner enough votes. While
the negotiations continued, the remainder of the 55-person EA team from Hurlburt arrived at Diyarba-
kir on 20 March. Although the populati on at Diyarbakir peaked at approximately 800 personnel, the
big influx of troops and equipment never occurred and the Hurlburt team dismantled the contingency
facilities and equipment and redeployed on 20 April. 
A4.14.9.  Engineers were called upon to support Special Operations Forces (SOF) at several locations.
At one base in Saudi Arabia, members of the 375th CES from Scott AFB bedded down more than
4,000 SOF troops while operating under a 45-day communications blackout. They erected 420 struc-
tures—tents, Alaska shelters, GP tents, Bedouin tents, AFCAP-procured tents, Sprung shelters, and
dome shelters. When additional engineers arrived from Moody and Beale AFBs, they created 1 mil-
lion gallons of fuel capability with two hot refueling pits, set up a seven-megawatt power plant and a
water distribution system with a water downloading point outside the gate, and used 9,000 square feet
of AM-2 mat to build parking pads for diverted fighters. The engineers dismantled the facilities during
May and redeployed forward to Baghdad International Airport in May. 
A4.14.10.  The 86th Contingency Response Group from Ramstein AB, Germany, deployed to Bashur
Airfield, 255 miles north of Baghdad in northern Iraq. Among them were firefighters and bioenviron-
mental engineers. The 7,000-foot runway was being used for C-17 and C-130 airlift missions, drop-
ping off approximately 1 million pounds of cargo a day to resupply coalition forces. The airfield, once
used to fly in oil field equipment, had become a bustling airlift hub supporting US Army forces.

A4.14.11.  The first civil engineer  squadron assigned to Iraq arri ved at Tallil on 27 March. 407th
Expeditionary CES (ECES) personnel worked with British engineers to bed down and support A-10
missions. They repaired two concrete runways, installed an airfield lighting system, and constructed
three fuel farms and more than 160 billeting tents, an electrical power plant and distribution system,
shower and latrine facilities and a dining facility. A 55-person EA team from the 114 CES, South
Dakota ANG, later joined them. The Guard team, together with a Reserve EP team from Beale built a
tent city for 2,200 (2 housekeeping sets) and operations and maintenance facilities for the A-10 and
C-130 missions at Tallil. Additional assets arrived from Cairo West on 28 April after that base closed.
Tallil was a coalition base, with troops from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Estonia, Lithuania,
and Korea. 
A4.14.12.  American forces entered and began securing Saddam International Airport, which they
renamed Baghdad International Airport (BIAP), on 5 April. CENTAF/C7 tapped Maj Richard Reid to
go to BIAP as the temporary BC E until another team could arrive. Major Reid was OIC of the 1 14
CES, South Dakota ANG Prime BEEF  team. While at Baghdad, Major Reid and a handful of engi-
neers began to lay out Air Force tent city but had no assets, vehicles, or equipment for several days.

A4.14.13.  On 17 April, an ADVON team headed by Lt Col Tracey Walker, including six firefighters
and six EOD troops, traveled from Bashur AB to Kirkuk AB, Iraq, via Army convoy. The airfield was
opened for operations just two days later. 
A4.14.14.  Air Force civil engineer ing tested a new capability duri ng OIF with the fielding of Air-
borne RED HORSE (ARH) teams. ARH teams take 21 traditional RED HORSE members and aug-
ment them with six firefighters, six explosive ordnance disposal technicians, and two chemical and
biological readiness experts. Developed under Chief of Staff General John P. Jumper’s direction, the
specially trained and equipped teams could deploy into austere locations to assess airfield capabilities,
prepare helicopter or aircraft landing areas, clear obstacles, instal l emergency airfield lighting, and
make expedient airfield damage repairs. They could also perform expedient force protection construc-
tion and clear explosive hazards. The teams could eith er parachute into these areas or be inserted by
“fast roping” from helicopters. Their equipment could be sling-loaded and carried by helicopter. The
Airborne RED HORSE units faced their first operational tests during the war in Iraq. Three teams sup-
ported forward basing of Joint forces at seized Iraqi airbases. At Tallil, they helped recover the airfield

in preparation for use by forward deployed air assets, cleared over 475 acres of airfield surface, swept
a 15-acre joint service beddown area, recovere d 13,000 small arms rounds, destroyed over 600 Gulf
War-era munitions, exploited 30 “first seen” munitions items, an d established a 20-acre explosive
storage area. At BIAP, they evaluated one million square yards of airfield pavements, conducted EOD
sweeps of mission critical areas, prepared four craters for permanent repair, installed and operated an
Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS), and battl ed a large structural fire at the 4th Infantry
Division’s headquarters. 
A4.14.15.  RED HORSE units were active at nearly every base in the theater. At Al Udeid AB, mem-
bers of the 823rd constructed a 17-acre parking ramp, valued at $9.1 million. Larger than 17 football
fields, the ramp doubled the parki ng spaces for KC-135 and KC-10 airc raft and was finished in less
than six months. While at Thumrait AB, Oman, RED HORSE engineers constructed a 47-acre parking
ramp with blast deflectors, as phalt taxiways, hammerhead, and area/edge lighting. The Air Force
engineers were able to complete the project in just six months, one -third the contractor estimate.
Members of the 307 RHS also constructed a 200’ x 200’ concrete munitions holding pad and an 8000’
x 24’ asphalt road. 
A4.14.16.  A handful of EOD specialists were involved in an interesting project in Iraq. On 29 March,
four Air Force EOD specialists from the 321st ECES and the 384th ECES and 10 Navy EOD troops
formed a 14-man team to execute Operation RESTORE IRAQI OIL under direction of the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force. Over a period of 30 days they cleared paths to 700 oil wellheads in the Rumay-
lah, Az Zubayr, and Safwan oilfields in Iraq and cl eared 14 gas-oil separation plants of unexploded
ordnance and improvised explosive devices. In the course of their work they also uncovered numerous
bunkers with weapons caches and de stroyed more than 5,000 pieces of ordnance to help secure the
valuable oilfields for the Iraqi people. 
A4.14.17.  Overall, more than 4,500 engineers were deployed in support of the initial OIF operations.
They established 12 new bases in the region and expanded the mission on all 10 existing bases on the
Arabian Peninsula. They set up 42 housekeeping sets or commercial housekeeping equivalents and
supported more than 64,000 Air For ce personnel, in addition to vari ous Army, Special Operations,
Marine, and coalition forces. They executed more than $329 million in construction through 211 new
contracts. Engineers placed 820,000 square yards of concrete and asphalt, enough to build a four-lane
highway from Orlando to Miami. They constructed 3.2 million square feet of contingency facilities or
the equivalent of building a Mall of America in  less than one year. Air Force engineers put up 3,200
bare base tents, installed 190 miles of expedient water piping, and built 200 million gallon petroleum,
oils and lubricants (POL) storage and distribution systems. 
A4.14.18.  Since 2003, civil engineers have continued to support the American presence in the region.
In 2004, they began to take on a new mission—direct support of the U.S. Army Combat Support Ser-
vice throughout Iraq and Kuwait. Known as “in lieu of” missions, engineers through the 732nd ECES
squadron at Balad AB Iraq were embedded into Ar my units providing engineering, design and fire-
fighting support to Army units who were short of trained engineers. This also meant expanded train-
ing for engineers supporting the Army. This entailed intensive training on convoy operations in
Kuwait, including a five-day live-fire exercise. The support to  the Army expanded later to include
RED HORSE squadrons. 
A4.14.19.  EOD forces have been heavily tasked to perform their missions in Iraq and Afghanistan in
light of the expanded use of improvised explosive devices by insurgent forces. Air Force EOD opera-
tions “outside the secured perimete r” were essential to air base force protection and the freedom of
208

operation of land-maneuver forces. Serving on weapons intelligence teams in Iraq and provisional
reconstruction teams in Afghanistan, EOD technicians provided agile combat support to the combat-
ant commander. 
A4.15.  Future Challenges. This brief history of Air Fo rce Civil Engineers introduces a series of pam-
phlets to help today’s Engineers prepare for future peacetime emergencies and wartime support when
once again they are called upon to demonstrate their “Can Do—Will Do’ spirit. To the extent possible, the
volumes in this series update the lessons of the past and provide current guidance. Some of those lessons
are timeless. Methods and procedures  relating to newer systems, for wh ich there are no historic prece-
dents, await the innovative ideas the unit develops and then passes al ong to those who will follow. The
gains of the past must not slip away, nor should anyone be satisfied with the status quo. The development
of new initiatives to further strengthen the ca pabilities of all engineers poses a continuing and exciting
challenge to every member of the force.
