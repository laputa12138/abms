1.3.2.2.  Supplementary guidance will not be less restrictive than the basic publication but 
can be more restrictive. (T-2) 
1.3.2.3.  Supplemental guidance will not contradict the basic publication. (T-2) 
1.4.  Procedures. 
1.4.1.  Evaluation Methods. The primary methods of determining the examinee’s level of job 
knowledge and proficiency are academic testing and observation of job performance. The 
questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation will be limited to 
items not determined by observation but related to the scenarios being employed for 
evaluation. (T-3) 
1.4.2.  Examiners will reference this manual to conduct evaluations. They will administer 
evaluations of those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification, unless specifically 
authorized in this manual. Examiners must be qualified and current to perform positional 
evaluations. (T-3) This excludes objectivity evaluations, as they are used to assess the skill of 
an examiner while administering an evaluation, requiring only a certification as an examiner. 
Note: Evaluations may be accomplished on the CRC portion of the Consolidated Simulation 
Building (CSB) located at Tinker Air Force Base; or any facility or system utilizing the 
Battlespace Command and Control Center - Air Force (BC3-AF), or other Air Combat 
Command Ground Battle Management Branch (ACC/A3CG) approved like system outlined 
in the CRC Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum. 
1.4.3.  Evaluation Procedures. 
1.4.3.1.  Prior to Evaluation. The SEE explains the purpose of the evaluation and how it is 
conducted. The examinee will accomplish all mission planning appropriate for the type of 
evaluation. (T-3) 
1.4.3.2.  During Evaluation. The SEE will evaluate the examinee's performance for each 
graded area and note discrepancies when deviations from prescribed performance criteria 
occur during the evaluation. (T-3) 
1.4.3.3.  Post Evaluation. The SEE will match the examinee’s performance with the 
grading criteria and will assign an appropriate grade for each area. (T-3) The judgment of 
the SEE will be the determining factor in assigning an overall grade for the examinee’s 
performance. (T-3) The SEE will consider cumulative momentary deviations. (T-3) The 
SEE will critique all aspects of the evaluation. (T-3) During this critique, the SEE will 
review the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned, and any 
additional training which the examinee will be required to complete. (T-3) All initial 
qualification or initial instructor evaluations resulting in Exceptionally Qualified (EQ), 
Qualified 2 (Q2), or Qualified 3 (Q3) will be debriefed with the examinee's squadron 
commander/operations officer (or designated representative). (T-3) 
1.4.3.4.  The examiner will not occupy a primary crew position during the evaluation. (T-3) 
1.4.4.  Evaluations will be accepted between ACC, USAFE-AFAFRICA, AETC, and ANG 
CRCs. (T-3) Unit examiners may give evaluations outside of their organization, to include 
administering evaluations outside of their MAJCOM. If administering evaluations outside of 
the examiner’s MAJCOM, the evaluation will be specifically requested by the MAJCOM 
AFMAN13-1CRCV2  7 JUNE 2024

Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization 
of the examiner in accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. 
1.4.5.  SEE Objectivity Evaluations. Examiners will reference AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2 for 
SEE Objectivity Evaluations criteria. (T-3) 
1.5.  Grading Policies. 
1.5.1.  Examiners will use the rating policy contained in AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2 and the 
evaluation criteria in this manual for conducting evaluations. (T-2) Use of these criteria will 
ensure standard and objective evaluations are administered to crew members. (T-2) SEEs and 
crewmembers will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed grading criteria in this manual. 
A three-tier grading system (Q, Q-, or Unqualified (U)) will be used for all areas except those 
designated as CRITICAL, in which case a two-tier grading system (Q or U) will be used. (T-2) 
An overall rating of Q-3 could result from an unqualified rating of a single critical or multiple 
noncritical areas. 
1.5.2.  Critical Areas. Critical areas are defined as events that require adequate accomplishment 
by the examinee to successfully achieve the mission objectives and complete the evaluation. If 
an examinee receives a “U” grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will 
also be unqualified. (T-3) Critical areas are identified by “(CRITICAL)” following the 
applicable area title. 
1.5.3.  Crewmembers receiving an overall Q-3 on either their QUAL or MSN evaluation will 
be immediately downgraded to unqualified status and must complete a RQ. (T-3) See AFMAN 
13-1GBMC2V2 for additional guidance on RQ evaluations.

Chapter 2 
EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 
2.1.  General.  All evaluations follow the guidelines set in AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. Evaluation 
requirements are depicted in each crew position's evaluation criteria section. 
2.1.1.  Required Evaluation Areas. Required evaluation areas are defined as all areas (and 
associated sub-areas) annotated with an “R” in this document. The examiner will evaluate the 
examinee’s performance in all required areas. (T-3) If an alternate evaluation method is used, 
the examiner will document the method under the Mission Description paragraph in the 
Comments section of the Air Force (AF) Form 8, Certification of Aircrew Qualification, in 
accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. (T-3) 
2.1.2.  Examiners will make every effort, including the use of multi-part evaluations, to 
evaluate all required areas during the live/virtual portion before resorting to alternate methods. 
(T-3) If it is infeasible to accomplish a required area (e.g., aircraft emergency during a live 
mission), and an alternate evaluation method is used (e.g., verbally or simulation), the 
examiner documents the method under the Mission Description paragraph in the Comments 
section of the AF Form 8 in accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. (T-3) 
2.2.  Requisites.  The following QUAL evaluation requisites are common to all crew positions 
and will be accomplished in accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2 and unit directives. The 
examinee must satisfy all requisites to complete periodic evaluations. (T-2) See AFMAN 13-
1GBMC2V2 for these requirements. Requisites will be recorded under the Requisite Information 
area, Section II of the AF Form 8. (T-2) Closed book exam questions will come from Master 
Question File/Local Operating Procedures/All Crew Master Question File. (T-3) For initial 
evaluations, all academic examinations will be completed prior to any positional portions of the 
evaluation. (T-3) For RQ evaluations the written examinations will be completed at the discretion 
of the Chief, Stan/Eval, but within their eligibility period. (T-3) Crewmembers with more than one 
qualification will complete all applicable closed book exams. (T-3) 
2.3.  Mission Qualification (MSN) Evaluation.  The MSN evaluation will be conducted in 
accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. (T-3) Crewmembers with more than one qualification 
will complete the MSN evaluation in all applicable crew positions. (T-3) 
2.3.1.  Mission Profiles. When conducting positional evaluations, the mission profiles used 
should accurately reflect the unit’s day-to-day training operations, the unit’s designed 
operational capabilities, provide a realistic assessment of the examinee’s skills, and evaluate 
the examinee's application of current tactics. (T-3) 
2.3.2.  Mission Simulator Evaluations. Simulations (SIMs) may be used to administer any 
portion of a positional evaluation not requiring a specific live/virtual scenario. Unit SEEs will 
identify existing SIM scenarios which include adequate activity to meet the evaluation 
requirements for the required events. (T-3) If adequate scenarios do not exist, unit Stan/Eval 
personnel will develop scenario outlines for the simulation activity to be conducted to ensure 
standardization of both the level of activity and the difficulty for SIM evaluations. (T-3) 
 
 
AFMAN13-1CRCV2  7 JUNE 2024

2.4.  Instructor Evaluation.  All crewmembers selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to 
determine their judgment, technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of 
student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their duty position. (T-3) 
To initially qualify as an instructor, a crewmember must successfully complete an initial instructor 
evaluation. (T-2) Subsequent evaluations of instructors are conducted during recurring evaluations 
in which individuals are qualified to instruct. 
2.4.1.  Instructors must demonstrate proficiency by instructing a student (or qualified 
individual acting as a student). (T-3) Instructor examinees must demonstrate the ability to 
instruct during mission planning and mission execution. (T-3) The examiner may require the 
examinee to present verbal explanations of equipment operations, procedures, and techniques 
pertinent to their crew position duties and responsibilities. 
2.4.2.  Instructor evaluations will be conducted with a student occupying the crew position 
whenever possible. (T-3) The student performs those duties prescribed by the instructor for the 
mission being accomplished. (T-3) The instructor examinee monitors all phases of the mission 
from an advantageous position and will be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area or 
procedure. (T-3) The SEE will particularly note the instructor’s ability to recognize student 
difficulties and provide effective, timely corrective action. (T-3) Recurring evaluations will be 
administered in conjunction with required qualification evaluations and will include all areas 
using both qualification and instructor criteria. (T-3) 
2.4.3.  During QUAL evaluations of qualified instructors, the examinee must assume the crew 
position for a period of sufficient length to demonstrate proficiency in the crew position. (T-3) 
The determination of what represents a sufficient length of time is left to the judgment of the 
SEE. The portion of the mission during which the examinee will occupy the seat position can 
be determined by the SEE during mission planning or during the mission. 
2.4.4.  All instructors will be graded using the criteria in paragraphs 2.4.4.1 through 2.4.4.4.3 
below. (T-3)

proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment and safety of flight to include 
aircraft emergencies. (T-3) ABM qualification evaluations may be conducted on 
live/virtual/constructive missions. Tasks not observed and assessed during the normal 
course of the evaluation will be evaluated verbally while the examinee is on position. (T-3) 
ABM qualification evaluations will be conducted on blue air side only to properly evaluate 
blue control with fighters operating blue air tactics. (T-3) When possible, the evaluation 
will be conducted in a controlled communications jamming environment; otherwise, 
communications jamming should be simulated. (T-3) Note: The intent of the qualification 
evaluation is for the examinee to demonstrate proficiency with the system (for example 
sensor knowledge, system capabilities) and an ability to effectively employ that system. 
3.1.1.2.  Mission Evaluation  . The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluation areas table. 
(T-3) Based on the examinee’s experience level, an ABM may be required to brief (to 
include tactics) and or lead certain phases of the mission. Section Leads (SLs) will be 
required to brief (to include tactics) and/or lead certain phases of the mission. (T-3) Mission 
evaluations will encompass all areas identified in Table 3.1 for the mission profile 
performed. (T-3) The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency 
essential for successful mission accomplishment, profile execution, and safety of flight to 
include aircraft emergencies. (T-3) Mission evaluations may be conducted on

and, when possible, conducted with a full operational crew as defined in AFMAN 13-
1CRCV3, Table 6.1. Evaluations during exercises or exercise deployments are encouraged. 
Evaluations during contingency/combat deployments may be given as a last resort to 
maintain mission qualification status with the concurrence of the examinee, and the 
deployed and unit commander. When a full operations crew is used, an Air Defense 
Artillery (ADA) interface may be simulated. When a full operations crew cannot be 
established, the crew composition will be such to meet the intent of the MSN evaluation to 
ensure adequate crew coordination is accomplished. (T-3) This is documented in the 
Mission Description of the AF Form 8. When possible, the evaluation will be conducted in 
a controlled communications jamming environment; otherwise, communications jamming 
will be simulated. (T-3) Note: The intent of the mission evaluation is for the examinee to 
demonstrate proficiency while employing the system in a live/virtual large force scenario 
(for example crew coordination, battle management, sensor employment). 
3.1.2.  ABM examinees will be evaluated according to their highest certification with 
evaluation profiles developed by the unit. (T-3) The examinee must control a mission that 
includes counterair or counterland and air refueling; or is sufficiently complex enough to meet 
intent in accordance with paragraphs 3.1.1.1., paragraph 3.1.1.2, and paragraph 3.1.2.3. 
Examples include but not limited to Large Force Employments (LFEs), Tanker Management 
Scenarios (4 or more tankers simultaneously with multiple fragged receivers), or dynamic lane 
defense missions. Crewmembers, regardless of designation as CMR or BMC will complete 
both QUAL and MSN evaluations. (T-3) A single mission can satisfy both QUAL and MSN 
requirements without having the examinee control separate events. 
3.1.2.1.  ABM. Examinee should conduct weapons activity as an Air-to-Air, planned Air-
to-Ground/Surface, or Dynamic Air-to-Ground/Surface controller as determined by the 
examiner. 
3.1.2.1.1.  Counterair missions will be conducted where examinees provide tactical or 
broadcast control as briefed by the aircrew. (T-3) The control will be provided to at 
least two separate fighters/elements simultaneously committed against a minimum of 
two targets. (T-3) The examiner will ensure the examinee participates in all phases of 
the mission. (T-3) Note: It is not a requirement for this mission to result in a 
maneuvering dogfight. 
3.1.2.1.2.  Counterland missions require the examinee to direct at least one flight of 
aircraft conducting air-to-surface tactics against a ground objective. The examinee will 
control the flight from check-in to the prosecution of at least one objective. (T-3) A 
counterland mission must include the following elements: 
3.1.2.1.2.1.  Airspace management: Assigning altitude blocks and/or safe 
deconfliction between aircraft (manned/unmanned). (T-3) 
3.1.2.1.2.2.  Target Area Brief: Air or ground picture and the objective area. (T-3) 
3.1.2.1.2.3.  Dynamic/Deliberate Tasking: Updated or pre-planned objective. (T-3) 
3.1.2.1.2.4.  Mission Report: Mission report. (T-3) 
3.1.2.1.3.  Air refueling missions require control of at least one tanker and receiver 
simultaneously, with at least two receivers (dynamic or fragged) total per scenario. 
14 
AFMAN13-1CRCV2  7 JUNE 2024 
SEEs retain the option for additional fragged receivers or dynamic rendezvous at SEE's 
discretion. 
3.1.2.2.  SL. Examinee will supervise a team conducting tactical control. (T-3) 
3.1.2.3.  There will be instances where an examinee during the mission, accomplishes all 
areas required for both the QUAL and the MSN evaluation. In this case, the evaluation will 
be annotated as a QUAL/MSN evaluation. (T-3) Acceptability of required activity will be 
based on the SEE’s determination that all areas required for a mission and a qualification 
evaluation have been met. (T-3) 
3.1.2.4.  ABM examiners (no certification) may conduct evaluations on ABM and WD 
crewmembers. 
3.1.2.5.  ABM examiners with SL certifications may conduct evaluations on ABM, SL, 
and WD crewmembers (unless restricted by the unit Letter of Certification/Qualification 
[LoX]).

Chapter 4 
WEAPONS DIRECTOR EVALUATIONS 
4.1.  General.  This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified WD 
Evaluation in accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. Evaluation requirements are outlined in 
Table 4.1 for WD and Instructor Weapons Director. 
4.1.1.  Evaluation Objectives  . 
4.1.1.1.  Qualification Evaluation  . The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluated mission. (T-3) 
Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in Table 4.1. (T-3) When 
possible, the evaluation should be conducted with a full operational crew as defined in 
AFMAN 13-1CRCV3, Table 6.1. When a full operations crew cannot be established, the 
crew composition will be such to meet the intent of the QUAL evaluation to ensure 
adequate crew coordination is accomplished. (T-3) This will be documented in the Mission 
Description of the AF Form 8 (Section VIII). (T-3) The examinee must demonstrate a 
degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment and 
safety of flight to include aircraft emergencies. (T-3) WD qualification evaluations may be 
conducted on live/virtual/constructive missions. Tasks not observed and assessed during 
the normal course of the evaluation will be evaluated verbally while the examinee is on 
position. (T-3) WD evaluations will be conducted on blue air side only to properly evaluate 
blue control with fighters operating blue air tactics during a counterair mission. (T-3) The 
mission profile must meet the minimum requirements of paragraph 4.1.1.4.1. (T-3) SEEs 
will make the determination as to whether briefed/conducted control activities fulfill 
control requirements. (T-3) When possible, the evaluation will be conducted in a controlled 
communications jamming environment; otherwise, communications jamming may be 
simulated. (T-3) Note: The intent of the qualification evaluation is for the examinee to 
demonstrate proficiency with the system (i.e., in accordance with sensor knowledge, 
system capabilities) and an ability to effectively employ that system. 
4.1.1.2.  Mission Evaluation.  The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluation areas table. 
(T-3) Mission evaluations will encompass all areas identified in Table 4.1 for the mission 
profile performed. (T-3) The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and 
proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment, profile execution, and safety 
of flight to include aircraft emergencies. (T-3) Mission evaluations may be conducted on 
live/virtual/constructive missions. Tasks not observed and assessed during the normal 
course of the evaluation will be evaluated verbally while the examinee is on position. (T-3) 
During the MSN evaluation, counterland and tanker management mission profiles must 
meet the minimum requirements of paragraphs 4.1.1.4.2 and 4.1.1.4.3. (T-3) When 
possible, MSN evaluations should replicate large force employment scenarios with 
supporting theater documents (SPINS, ROE, ATO/ACO, etc.), mission packages, and 
ADA interface, command and control electronic warfare and HHQ integration. The 
evaluation should include participation of at least one or more external theater air control 
28 
AFMAN13-1CRCV2  7 JUNE 2024 
system units and, when possible, conducted with a full operational crew as defined in 
AFMAN 13-1CRCV3, Table 6.1. Evaluations during exercises or exercise deployments 
are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat deployments may be given as a 
last resort to maintain mission qualification status with concurrence of the examinee, the 
deployed and unit commander. If a full operations crew is used, an ADA interface should 
be simulated. When possible, the evaluation will be conducted in a controlled 
communications jamming environment; otherwise, communications jamming may be 
simulated. (T-3) Note: The intent of the mission evaluation is for the examinee to 
demonstrate proficiency while employing the system in a live/virtual large force scenario 
(i.e., in accordance with crew coordination, battle management, sensor employment). 
4.1.1.3.  There will be instances where an examinee during the mission, accomplishes all 
areas required for both the QUAL and the MSN evaluation. In this case, the evaluation will 
be annotated as a QUAL/MSN evaluation. (T-3) Acceptability of required activity will be 
based on the SEE’s determination that all areas required for a mission and a qualification 
evaluation have been met. (T-3) 
4.1.1.4.  The examinee must control a mission that includes counterair or counterland and 
air refueling; or is sufficiently complex enough to meet intent in accordance with 
paragraph 4.1.1.1., paragraph 4.1.1.2, and paragraph 4.1.1.3. Examples include but not 
limited to LFEs, Tanker Management Scenarios (4 or more tankers simultaneously with 
multiple fragged receivers), or dynamic lane defense missions. Crewmembers, regardless 
of designation as CMR or BMC will complete both QUAL and MSN evaluations. (T-3) A 
single mission can satisfy both QUAL and MSN requirements without having the examinee 
control separate events. 
4.1.1.4.1.  Counterair missions will be conducted where weapons examinees provide 
tactical or broadcast control as briefed by the aircrew. (T-3) The control will be 
provided to at least two separate fighters/elements simultaneously committed against a 
minimum of two targets. (T-3) The examiner will ensure the weapons examinee 
participates in all phases of the mission. (T-3) Note: It is not a requirement for this 
mission to result in a maneuvering dogfight. 
4.1.1.4.2.  Counterland missions require the examinee to direct at least one flight of 
aircraft conducting air-to-surface tactics against a ground objective. The examinee will 
control the flight from check-in to the prosecution of at least one objective. (T-3) A 
counterland mission must include the following elements: 
4.1.1.4.2.1.  Airspace management: Assigning altitude blocks and/or safe 
deconfliction between aircraft (manned/unmanned). (T-3) 
4.1.1.4.2.2.  Target Area Brief: Air or ground picture and the objective area. (T-3) 
4.1.1.4.2.3.  Dynamic/Deliberate Tasking: Updated or pre-planned objective. (T-3) 
4.1.1.4.2.4.  Mission Report: Mission report. (T-3) 
4.1.1.4.3.  Air refueling missions require control of at least one tanker and receiver 
simultaneously, with at least two receivers (dynamic or fragged) total per scenario. 
SEEs retain the option for additional fragged receivers or dynamic rendezvous at SEEs 
discretion.

AIR SURVEILLANCE TECHNICIAN EVALUATIONS 
5.1.  General.  This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified Air 
Surveillance Technician (AST) in accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. Evaluation 
requirements are outlined in Table 5.1 for AST and Instructor Air Surveillance Technician. 
5.1.1.  Evaluation Objectives  . 
5.1.1.1.  Qualification Evaluation  . The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluated mission. (T-3) 
Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in Table 5.1. (T-3) All efforts 
should be made to conduct the evaluation with a full operations crew as defined in AFMAN 
13-1CRCV3, Table 6.1. AST qualification evaluations will be conducted, at a minimum, 
with a surveillance team and applicable technicians during a live/virtual/constructive 
mission. (T-3) The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency 
essential for successful mission accomplishment and safety of flight to include aircraft 
emergencies. (T-3) Tasks not observed and assessed during the normal course of evaluation 
will be evaluated verbally while the examinee is on position. (T-3) When possible, the 
evaluation will be conducted in a controlled communications jamming environment; 
otherwise, communications jamming may be simulated. (T-3) At least one Tactical Digital 
Information Link will be used. (T-3) Link events can occur on different days and/or with 
different agencies. Note: The intent of the qualification evaluation is for the examinee to 
demonstrate proficiency with the system (i.e., in accordance with sensor knowledge, 
system capabilities) and an ability to effectively employ that system. 
5.1.1.2.  Mission Evaluation  . The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluation areas table. 
(T-3) Mission evaluations will encompass all required areas identified in Table 5.1, for the 
mission profile performed. (T-3) All efforts should be made to conduct the evaluation with 
a full operations crew as defined in AFMAN 13-1CRCV3, Table 6.1. AST MSN 
evaluations will be conducted, at a minimum, with a surveillance operations team and 
applicable technicians during a live/virtual/constructive mission. (T-3) Tasks not observed 
and assessed during the normal course of the evaluation will be evaluated verbally while 
the examinee is on position. (T-3) The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge 
and proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment, profile execution, and 
safety of flight to include aircraft emergencies. (T-3) When possible, MSN evaluations will 
replicate large force employment scenarios with supporting theater documents (SPINS, 
ROE, ATO/ACO, etc.), mission packages, and command and control electronic warfare 
and HHQ integration. (T-3) The evaluation should include participation of at least one or 
more external theater air control system units. Evaluations during exercises or exercise 
deployments are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat deployments may be 
given as a last resort to maintain mission qualification status with the concurrence of the 
examinee, the deployed and unit commander. When possible, the evaluation will be 
conducted in a controlled communications jamming environment; otherwise, 
38 
AFMAN13-1CRCV2  7 JUNE 2024 
communications jamming may be simulated. (T-3) Note: The intent of the mission 
evaluation is for the examinee to demonstrate proficiency while employing the system in a 
live/virtual large force scenario (i.e., in accordance with crew coordination, air/ground 
picture management, sensor employment). 
5.1.1.3.  There will be instances where an examinee, during the mission, accomplishes all 
areas required for both the QUAL and MSN evaluations. In this case, the evaluation will 
be annotated as a QUAL/MSN evaluation. (T-3) Acceptability of required activity will be 
based on the evaluator’s determination that all areas required for a mission and 
qualification evaluation have been met. (T-3) 
5.1.1.4.  Completion of an AST or Instructor Air Surveillance Technician evaluation 
includes demonstration of competence as an Interface Control Technician (ICT) and 
Surveillance Technician (ST); and qualifies the AST to perform as an ICT and ST, and the 
Instructor Air Surveillance Technician to perform as an Instructor Interface Control 
Technician (IICT) and Instructor Surveillance Technician (IST). An Examiner AST may 
accomplish evaluations on AST, Mission System Operator (MSO), ICT, and ST positions. 
5.1.1.5.  ASTs that were previously qualified as IICTs and/or ISTs may continue to 
perform IICT and/or IST duties under the following conditions: 
5.1.1.5.1.  During the Instructor AST (IAST) Initial QUAL evaluation and subsequent 
recurring IAST evaluations, the IAST must perform IICT and/or IST duties. (T-3) 
5.1.1.5.2.  Restrictions for what positions they can instruct based on previous 
experience can be documented on the AF Form 8 as a restriction (e.g., 
“RESTRICTION: Examinee may only instruct ST and ICT crewmembers.”) or via the 
unit LoX. (T-2)

INTERFACE CONTROL TECHNICIAN EVALUATIONS 
6.1.  General.  This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a qualified ICT 
in accordance with AFMAN 13-1GBMC2V2. Evaluation requirements are outlined in Table 6.1 
for ICT and IICT. 
6.1.1.  Evaluation Objectives  . 
6.1.1.1.  Qualification Evaluation  . The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluated mission. (T-3) 
Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in Table 6.1. (T-3) The 
examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for successful 
mission accomplishment and safety of flight. (T-3) ICT qualification evaluations will be 
conducted either during routine daily operations or Mission Training Exercises. (T-3) 
Tasks not observed and assessed during the normal course of the evaluation will be 
evaluated verbally while the examinee is on position. (T-3) The evaluation requires the 
participation of at least one external Theater Air Control System unit or agency. At least 
one Link 11 or Link 16 will be used. (T-3) Link events can occur on different days and/or 
with different agencies. Note: The intent of the qualification evaluation is for the examinee 
to demonstrate proficiency with the system (i.e., in accordance with switch actions, sensor 
knowledge, system capabilities) and an ability to effectively employ that system. 
6.1.1.2.  Mission Evaluation.  The examinee will be evaluated on their ability to 
accomplish required tasks safely and effectively, in accordance with technical orders, 
manuals, directives, and operating procedures applicable to the evaluation areas table. 
(T-3) Mission evaluations will encompass all required areas identified in Table 6.1 for the 
mission profile performed. (T-3) All efforts should be made to conduct the evaluation with 
a full operations crew as defined in AFMAN 13-1CRCV3, Table 6.1. ICT mission 
evaluation will be conducted, at a minimum, with an AST and an SL during a 
live/virtual/constructive mission. (T-3) The examinee must demonstrate a degree of 
knowledge and proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment, profile 
execution, and safety of flight. (T-3) When possible, MSN evaluations should replicate 
large force employment scenarios with supporting theater documents (SPINS, ROE, 
ATO/ACO, etc.), mission packages, and command and control electronic warfare and 
HHQ integration. The evaluation should include participation of at least one or more 
external Theater Air Control System units. Evaluations during exercises or exercise 
deployments are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat deployments may be 
given as a last resort to maintain mission qualification status with the concurrence of the 
examinee, the deployed and unit commander. When possible, the evaluation will be 
conducted in a controlled communications jamming environment; otherwise, 
communications jamming may be simulated. (T-3) Note: The intent of the mission 
evaluation is for the examinee to demonstrate proficiency while employing the system in a 
live/virtual large force scenario (i.e., in accordance with crew coordination, link 
management). 
50 
AFMAN13-1CRCV2  7 JUNE 2024 
6.1.1.3.  There will be instances where an examinee during the mission, accomplished all 
areas required for both the qualification and the mission evaluations. In this case, the 
evaluations will be annotated as a QUAL/MSN evaluation. (T-3) Acceptability of required 
activity will be based on the evaluator’s determination that all areas required for a mission 
and a qualification evaluation have been met. (T-3)

Terms 
Additional Training—Any training or action recommended by an examiner to remedy 
deficiencies identified during an evaluation. 
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—A crew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT and 
MQT, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not maintain CMR status. The 
crewmember must be able to attain full qualification to meet operational taskings within 30 duty 
days. This status also applies to those individuals who are assigned to a unit that does not have a 
DOC tasking. BMC crewmembers do not maintain CMR status due to duty assignment or other 
reasons as determined by the appropriate authority. 
Certification—1) Procedure used to document competency in a particular task. Not 
interchangeable with “qualification,” which requires AF Form 8 documentation. 2) A formal 
indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards. 3) The formal action 
of completing/signing documentation taken by a certification official, e.g., “the unit commander 
certified the AF Form 8”.

Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status of an individual who successfully completes IQT 
and MQT, and maintains qualification and proficiency in the unit combat mission. 
Constructive Missions—Constructive entities simulate real world or virtual systems 
automatically, or manually driven by an operator or a white force personnel supporting distributed 
training that operate as training aids for warfighters accomplishing readiness training. Models and 
simulations that involve simulated people operating simulated systems. Real people stimulate 
(make inputs) to such simulations. Constructive simulations can also be used to model natural 
processes without human involvement (e.g. weather). 
Mission Evaluation (MSN)—An evaluation given after MQT to certify an individual as CMR.
