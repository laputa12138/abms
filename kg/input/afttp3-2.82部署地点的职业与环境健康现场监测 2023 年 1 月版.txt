CHAPTER 1 
Overview 
1.1 FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION 
DODD 6200.04, Force Health Protection, states that it is DOD policy that Force Health Protection (FHP) 
complements full-dimensional force protection efforts. In part, FHP activities provide a healthy and fit force by 
protecting the force from health hazards through routine inspections and mitigation of industrial, occupational, 
operational, and environmental hazards and document significant exposures, including those associated with 
noise, climate, chemicals, radiation, infectious agents, air, food, water, waste, and pests. 
The protection of the force from health hazards is a key piece of FHP, which is part of the joint function of 
protection. JP 4-02, Joint Health Services, provides doctrine to plan, prepare, and execute joint and combined 
FHP activities (along with other health services) across the competition continuum. 
This publication supports the FHP function of health surveillance and risk management at military basing sites in 
the operational environment (e.g., base camp, airbase, forward operating base (FOB)). According to JP 4-02, 
health surveillance and risk management plans and requirements must be included in the health service support 
(HSS) annex for plans and orders. The material within this publication informs the development of such HSS 
annexes and also comes under the policy umbrella of DODD 6420.02, DOD Biosurveillance. 
1.2 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE SURVEILLANCE 
Occupational and environmental health surveillance (OEHS) is a significant component of the FHP function of 
health surveillance and risk management (see JP 4-02). As defined by DODD 6490.02E, Comprehensive Health 
Surveillance, OEHS is the regular or repeated collection, analysis, archiving, interpretation, and dissemination of 
occupational and environmental health-related data for monitoring the health of, or potential health hazard impact 
on, a population and individual personnel, and for intervening in a timely manner to prevent, treat, or control the 
occurrence of disease or injury when determined necessary. 
Occupational and environmental health site surveillance (OEHSS) is focused upon health hazards and exposures 
at military basing sites in the operational environment (e.g., base camp, airbase, forward operating base (FOB)). It 
structures and facilitates exposure monitoring, health risk assessment (HRA), and risk management activities at 
these sites. The OEHSS process is iterative and educates FHP personnel about site environmental conditions, 
documents those conditions, identifies potential occupational and environmental health (OEH) threats and 
associated specific health hazards, includes OEH data collection and archiving activities and HRAs, and 
documents immediate risk mitigation actions. It is part of the risk management process and is performed in 
accordance with DODI 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health; DODI 6490.03, and DHA-PI 6490.03. 
These policies set the high-level requirements for OEHSS. This doctrinal manual provides the multi-Service 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for executing OEHSS. 
1.2.1 Surveillance Requirements and Deployment Locations 
Consistent with policy guidance found in DODI 6490.03 and DHA-PI 6490.03, OEHSS should be conducted at 
deployment basing locations that last longer than 30 days outside the United States, with rare exceptions. There 
are two types of deployment locations outside the United States: contingency and enduring. For contingency 
locations (CLs), all of the OEHSS elements apply; for enduring locations (ELs), only some of the OEHSS 
elements may be required (per DODI 6490.03). Refer to 2.1 for more details about these types of deployment 
locations. For some ELs, formal occupational health (OH) programs and/or environmental compliance programs 
will be established due to their size, infrastructure maturity, and longevity. Such specific OEH considerations 
should be handled by guidance and doctrine for those industrial hygiene (IH) programs or environmental 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
1-2 
 
compliance programs. These situations can be further clarified by command headquarters and the supporting 
OEHS Center. 
DODI 6490.03 and DHA-PI 6490.03 imply that deployment basing locations of shorter durations (less than 
30 days) and those within the United States only require one of the OEHSS components unless the operational 
commander requires additional OEHSS components based on identified health risks. This component is the 
preliminary hazard assessment (PLHA). 
1.2.2 Components, Phases, and Process 
OEHSS supports FHP and risk management through an iterative process that produces an initial PLHA followed 
by recurring occupational and environmental health site assessment (OEHSA) surveys and surveillance status 
briefings and leads to on-going site exposure monitoring (OSEM) activities. During deployment, the events, 
knowledge, and data produced by this on-going iterative process are documented within the Defense Occupational 
and Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene (DOEHRS-IH) and later captured within both 
written periodic occupational and environmental monitoring summaries (POEMSs) and the individual 
longitudinal exposure record (ILER). Figure 1-1 defines these OEHSS components. 
Term 
Definition 
1. PLHA 
A document that summarizes relevant medical intelligence data, 
past hazard assessments, and all other available information for a 
new deployment location for the purpose of early identification (ID) 
of potential OEH threats and risk management countermeasures 
prior to deploying to a newly established location. 
2. OEHSA Survey 
Formal documentation of the actual OEH conditions at a basing 
location. These surveys are typically updated annually and/or with 
the rotations of FHP teams into and out of the area of operations. 
3. OEHSS Status Briefings 
Briefings used to communicate the top OEH issues and site 
surveillance priorities for a basing location. Status briefings are 
typically performed by the FHP team at the end of its site visits that 
assess OEH conditions, often on a 3- to 6-month recurring basis. 
Deployment location commanders and their staff elements are the 
primary audience for the briefings. 
4. OSEM 
The collection of OEH monitoring and assessment activities 
performed for a basing location that includes regular site visits, 
conceptual site model (CSM) adjustments, sampling and analysis 
plans (SAPs) (see 4.4), field sampling, laboratory analyses, HRAs, 
and associated documentation. OSEM activities occur in between 
each OEHSA survey and includes OEH status briefings. 
5. DOEHRS-IH 
The DOD system of record for managing information, data, 
knowledge, and activities related to OEHSS and other processes. 
This captures the activities from the components above (1 through 
4) and provides them for use in components below (6 and 7).

6. POEMS 
A retrospective summary documentation of the OEH exposure 
concerns and HRAs at a deployment location. These documents 
compile information covering from one to many years at specific 
locations. OEH physicians are the primary audience. 
7. ILER 
An online DOD and Veterans Administration (VA) application that 
provides a record of every Service and civilian member’s 
documented OEH exposures over the course of his or her career. 
The ILER includes OEHSS data and information obtained from 
DOEHRS-IH. 
Note: Two key components, OEHSA and OSEM, drive the structure and tempo of all OEHSS activities. 
Figure 1-1. OEHSS Components (Sheet 2 of 2) 
OEHSS is conducted according to the phases identified in Figure 1-2 and proceeds over time using an iterative 
process illustrated in Figure 1-3. The phases are based on the operations process, which drives the conceptual and 
detailed planning necessary to understand, visualize, and describe the operational environment; make and 
articulate decisions; and direct, lead, and assess military operations. The activities of the site surveillance 
approach are not fully discrete; they overlap and recur as circumstances demand. Assessing is continuous and 
influences the other three phases.

Operations Process Activities 
Definition 
OEHSS Activities 
Planning 
The art and science of understanding 
a situation, envisioning a desired 
future, and laying out effective ways 
of bringing that future about. 
Before deployment, identify and organize assets and 
receive predeployment training, conduct initial 
planning for all assigned sites. Either initiate the 
OEHSA survey process (for new locations), or review 
the previously completed OEHSS components (for 
preexisting locations). 
Preparation 
Those activities performed by units 
and personnel to improve their ability 
to execute an operation. 
Once in theater, improve ability to conduct OEHSS 
activities, to include preparing for specific site visits 
and refining sampling and analysis plans. 
Execution 
Putting a plan into action by applying 
combat power to accomplish the 
mission. 
Execute the plans. Perform site visits, inspections and 
interviews, execute sampling and analysis plans, 
generate data, conduct HRAs, report findings to the 
command, and complete documentation. 
Assessment 
The continuous determination of the 
progress toward accomplishing a 
task, creating an effect, or achieving 
an objective. 
Evaluate progress and performance and develop 
lessons learned. 
Figure 1-2. OEHSS Phases 
In reference to Figure 1-3, the first full iteration of the OEHSS process for a deployment location produces a 
PLHA and baseline assessment of OEH conditions referred to as the initial OEHSA survey. This includes the 
establishment of the CSM of exposure pathway (EPs) and the initiation of OSEM activities. Occurring between 
periodic OEHSA surveys, OSEM activities track conditions during site visits and generate information and 
measurement data for the CSM. The information and data are used to document exposures and perform HRAs.  
Subsequent iterations of the OEHSS process (typically on either an annual or FHP team rotation basis) will 
validate or revise the described conditions in the previous OEHSA survey. A review of the implementation of

previous actionable mitigation actions to reduce OEH risks, updates of the CSM, and revisions of the plans for 
continuing OSEM activities based on accumulated findings from data collection efforts, HRAs, and any other 
requirements for data collection to support command risk management processes, will be completed. 
All process reiterations are reassessments that serve to verify and prioritize OEH threats and conceptual models of 
how personnel are, or may be, exposed to the OEH hazards associated with those threats. Each iteration serves as 
a tool for FHP personnel and commanders to guide allocation of site surveillance resources. 
 
Figure 1-3. OEHSS Iterative Process (High-level View) 
The number of OEHSA surveys and OSEM iterations conducted over time will be defined primarily by the 
longevity of the deployment location and risk-based findings of each successive iteration. For example, if high 
risks are identified, more frequent monitoring tasks and reports may be required. High risks will require the 
development of risk reduction steps and a review of the implementation of previous actionable recommendations 
to reduce OEH risks. 
Information and data generated during all iterations of the OEHSS process are to be recorded in the system of 
record for OEH monitoring and risk assessment data (i.e., DOEHRS-IH) (see JP 4-02). It is preferable to directly 
document all site surveillance activities within DOEHRS-IH throughout the entire process. Chapter 6 provides 
more details for this system of record. 
All of the activities, information, and data captured in DOEHRS-IH can be used to provide summary information 
about known exposures and health risks for the POEMS documents and ILER. These help to communicate to 
OEH professionals, commanders, and Service members regarding known exposure and health risks of those who 
were stationed at the deployment location.

1.3 DEPLOYMENT TEAMS AND OEHS CENTERS 
Successful OEHSS involves collaboration between deployed FHP teams, their command headquarters, and one or 
more of the Defense Health Agency-Public Health (DHA-PH) OEHS Centers listed below. Appendix A provides 
the types of deployment teams. The OEHS Centers provide reachback consultation capabilities, develop best 
practices (a set of guidelines that represents the best course of action), assist in information and data quality 
review and assessments, and maintain enterprise-level historical knowledge about previous and on-going OEHSS 
activities at deployment locations worldwide. A key function of these centers is to provide collaborative support 
to deployed forces in the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of OEHSS activities. The Defense 
Health Agency is a combat support agency responsible for OEHS Center support to the combatant commands. 
FHP teams conducting OEHSS activities require coordination with the DHA-PH OEHS Centers. The FHP teams 
conducting OEHSS activities simultaneously inform leadership through official command channels for situational 
awareness.

CHAPTER 2 
Deployment Locations and 
Site Assessments 
2.1 DEPLOYMENT LOCATIONS 
DOD classifies overseas basing into two types of locations: CL and EL. The distinction is important for FHP 
personnel to understand because the classification informs funding, policy, planning decisions, and strategic and 
tactical focus. The distinction between these types of overseas bases can impact how OEHSS activities are 
implemented at a given deployment location (see 1.2.1). While CLs and ELs serve unique purposes in support of 
U.S. military objectives overseas, both are components of DOD’s overall global defense posture and allow DOD 
to synchronize posture management to achieve efficiencies. 
1. CLs (DODD 3000.10, Contingency Basing Outside the United States) support activities in contingency 
operations or other operations as directed by a combatant commander (CCDR). CLs are categorized as initial, 
temporary, or semipermanent. CLs support contingency activities that are intended to be temporary in nature. 
However, if a CL is meeting an enduring requirement, it should transition to an EL. 
2. ELs (DODI 3000.12, Management of U.S. Global Defense Posture (GDP) enable ongoing operations 
activities and interests, which may or may not require a continuous force presence and provide strategic 
access to support U.S. strategic interests and response to regional and/or global contingencies. 
JP 4-04, Contingency Basing, provides doctrine for CLs. JP 4-04 states that basing activities occur along a 
spectrum in which the standards for facilities, equipment, and services depend on the current and anticipated 
future operating environment, type and priority of the mission, and the anticipated duration of use. CLs currently 
have many labels (such as bases, base camps, intermediate staging bases, forward operating bases, patrol bases, 
and combat outposts). Fundamentally, CLs support CCDRs’ operational requirements through the provision of 
base operating support (BOS) services, physical and technological infrastructure, and logistical assets and 
capabilities. The contingency basing spectrum spans from those built under the most austere conditions, using 
organic assets, to those providing semipermanent facilities and enhanced quality of life. Mission requirements and 
diplomatic considerations and authorities may dictate when locations will transition from CL to EL, but for 
planning purposes, this transition should ideally happen around the 5-year point. 
The base operating support-integrator (BOS-I) is a subfunction of the CLs lead Service. The BOS-I plans and 
synchronizes the efficient application of resources and contracting. The CL commander (base commander) is a 
geographic combatant command (GCC)-designated representative responsible for the day-to-day operation, 
management, protection, and provision of services at a CL. In many cases, the base commander and BOS-I will 
be the same person. 
2.2 ENGINEERS’ ASSESSMENTS 
The environmental conditions at a site are key pieces of information about a deployment location that FHP 
personnel should consider during the OEHSS process. The engineers assess and document environmental 
conditions throughout the operational phases of a CL using what is generally termed an environmental condition 
study (ECS) (see DODI 4715.22, Environmental Management Policy for Contingency Locations). An ECS is a 
study, report, analysis, or other documentation that adequately describes the environmental conditions at a CL, 
and includes an EBS, environmental conditions reports (ECRs), environmental site closure surveys (ESCSs), and 
other site conditions reports. For new deployment locations, these reports should be reviewed prior to the 
completion of the PLHA. If environmental conditions have not been documented, the engineers’ baseline 
assessment of environmental conditions is often performed with the OEHSA survey. 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
2-2 
 
JP 4-04 states that an EBS or ECS is recommended during the overseas base planning process, characterizes 
environmental conditions and risks, and often performed in conjunction with an OEHSA survey (refer to 
DODI 4715.22). Collectively, they provide valuable information that supports base master planning decisions. In 
addition to on-base conditions, these surveys can also provide vital information to planners about off-base and 
regional conditions that could affect base master planning, including local roads, railroads, airports, land use 
issues, and population density in the base vicinity. Planners should use geospatial software planning tools, when 
available. 
Coordination between deployment location FHP activities and Engineer Operations related to site and 
environmental considerations is expected. JP 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations, states that successful planning and 
execution of joint Engineer Operations requires ever-increasing attention to environmental considerations. The 
engineer staff of a joint force is responsible for environmental support operations, which includes completing 
EBSs and other environmental surveys, as well as providing the guidance on environmental considerations, risks, 
and issues. The initial EBS for CLs and other selected sites should occur as a part of the engineers’ 
reconnaissance mission and be linked to the OEHSA survey. Working with other staff officers, the engineer 
determines the impact of operations on the environment and the corresponding effect of the environment on 
Service members, and integrates environmental considerations into the decision-making process. 
Additional doctrine includes the following: 
1. ATP 3-34.5/MCRP 3-40B.2, Environmental Considerations, provides guidance for applying 
environmental considerations during planning, training, and the conduct of contingency operations. 
2. ATP 3-37.10/MCRP 3-40D.13, Base Camps, provides a comprehensive how-to guide for performing all 
activities of the base camp life cycle during deployments. 
3. AFI 32-7020, Environmental Restoration Program, provides USAF guidance for conducting 
environmental baseline surveys. 
Notes 
• Completed environmental surveys and reports are available at the following U. S. 
Army Corps of Engineer’s Reachback Engineer Data Integration websites: 
○ https://uroc-redi.usace.army.mil/ 
○ https://uroc-redi.uroc.army.smil.mil/. 
• It is highly recommended FHP teams coordinate directly with Engineer Operations 
personnel rather than solely relying on documentation. 
2.3 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENTS 
OEHSAs are similar to engineers’ site assessments, but they focus more heavily on OEH threats, health hazards, 
EPs, sampling and analysis, and the resulting HRAs. Appendix B provides a brief description of the data captured 
on the OEHSA survey. All the OEH assessments that are embedded within the OEHSS process are identified in 
Figure 1-1 and listed below. Water system inspections and facility sanitation inspections that are performed 
alongside the surveillance process, are outside the scope of this manual.

CHAPTER 3 
Health Risk Assessment Concepts 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
HRA is a core capability that optimizes FHP and readiness in all environments. Within the context of OEHSS, the 
HRA process is used to: 
1. Estimate risk by synthesizing available information to identify sources of OEH threats at a site 
2. Identify the health hazards associated with each threat source 
3. Identify populations at risk 
4. Guide data collection requirements and plans 
5. Describe the magnitude and timing of population exposures 
6. Describe the kinds of health effects caused by the exposure 
7. Characterize the risk information in order to effectively communicate to commanders and stakeholders. 
Properly designed HRA frameworks and products support risk management by providing actionable information 
that is relevant, reliable, timely, and understood. HRA activities and products allow individuals and commanders 
to make informed risk decisions when necessary as they apply risk management principles. The key output of a 
formal risk assessment is the risk estimate, which is the ultimate measure of risk to the population, task, or 
operation. Risk estimates can be qualitative or quantitative. HRAs should be designed to express risk in the way 
that is most useful to risk managers and be translatable into a format that is understandable to personnel and 
stakeholders. How health risk estimates are expressed to, and discussed with, personnel and stakeholders should 
be based on risk communication principles. 
HRAs must be designed to deal with uncertainty. Uncertainties exist in the ID and measurement of hazards, 
estimation of exposures, ID and measurement of health effects associated with exposures, and method used to 
characterize population and operational risks. The conduct of a risk assessment is an iterative process designed to 
be refined over several iterations until there is sufficient certainty on the most important factors affecting the 
results. 
While an HRA is a powerful tool to organize and articulate information and knowledge, risk assessment 
conclusions should not overinterpret data or results. HRA conclusions should focus on facts and knowledge, and 
accurately reflect the magnitude of uncertainty involved in the assumptions used to derive the estimate. A risk 
estimate is designed to inform a risk management, and its generation is influenced by assumptions based on data 
availability and risk perceptions. How confident risk managers need to be on the important but uncertain factors 
should drive the duration and complexity of the risk assessment life cycle. 
3.2 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE SURVEILLANCE HEALTH RISK 
ASSESSMENT 
Within OEHSS, HRA principles are embedded throughout the process and do not only apply to formal HRA 
reports. There are seven HRA activities that operationalize the above concepts of complexity, uncertainty, and 
time-to-decision within the framework of OEHSS. Figure 3-1 presents these activities, who typically performs 
them, and the type of health risk judgments made. Health risk judgments are site-specific and informed 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023

determinations that are made by OEH personnel based on professional judgment that reflect what is known at the 
time about OEH hazard exposure and health risk. Figure 3-2 illustrates where the key HRA risk judgments are 
produced within the overall OEHSS process. Each of these HRA risk judgments represent different iterations of 
the HRA process and are characterized by increasing levels of information, data, knowledge, and levels of skill 
and experience needed to complete.

3. Refer to 3.4 for rapid HRA, enhanced HRA, and sitewide HRA definitions. 
4. Refer to 3.6 for more information about risk estimates. 
5. FHP teams may have the capability for employing field-screening and/or field-measurement equipment that 
allows them to avoid the need to send samples to a distant analytical laboratory. This allows teams to 
perform rapid HRA that can be used to characterize an EP. 
6. The requirement to develop and execute an E-SAP with a follow-on enhanced EP/HRA is contingent on the 
EP priority level and the available resources. 
7. In some cases, deployment location commanders may request sampling and analysis activities based on 
perceived risk or other risk management considerations. 
8. Locations that require POEMS are to be identified by CCMD.

3.3 CONCEPTUAL SITE MODELS AND EXPOSURE PATHWAYS 
This section introduces the concept of a CSM and its associated exposure pathways. It also identifies best 
practices for managing CSMs, defines exposure pathway priority levels, and discusses the evolution of a CSM 
over time. 
3.3.1 Conceptual Site Model Concept 
A CSM is a graphical, pictorial, and/or tabular depiction of what is known about a site in terms of what, where, 
when, why, who, and how exposures to health hazards may or may not occur. The CSM serves as the blueprint 
for understanding the situation, designing surveillance and sampling plans, identifying at-risk populations, 
describing health risks, and prioritizing risk management actions to control unacceptable risks. A CSM represents 
the compilation of all the exposure scenarios and their EPs that are associated with a site. 
Within DOEHRS-IH, what is referred to as a location’s CSM is the table of EPs (see Figure 3-3) and includes any 
data and information elements that are part of those EPs. There are two types of CSMs for OEHSS that are found 
within DOEHRS-IH (listed below). 
1. Active CSM. This is the current CSM and includes all of the actively managed Defense Occupational and 
Environmental Health Reporting System (DOEHRS) EPs for a location. Any and all data collection, 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
3-4 
 
monitoring, and EP assessments (e.g., HRAs) for the pathways should be managed from within the active 
CSM. 
2. OEHSA CSM. This CSM represents a snapshot of all the DOEHRS EPs that have been associated with a 
specific OEHSA survey. An OEHSA CSM may contain EPs that are not in the active CSM because they have 
been stop-dated and are no longer representative of current conditions. 
Note 
Any data collection, monitoring, and HRAs for an EP should be managed from within 
the active CSM. EPs removed from, or added to, an active CSM in the time period 
between two different OEHSA surveys should be addressed in the newer OEHSA 
survey. 
3.3.2 Exposure Pathways 
An EP is defined as a description of how exposure occurs from health hazard release from a source into the 
environment, transport through the environment within one or more environmental media (air, water, soil, 
surfaces, etc.), the routes of human exposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, etc.), and where and when 
specific personnel come into contact with the hazard (e.g., a specific cohort exposed at the same time or in a 
similar way). There are six components of an EP. Each must be present in order for an actual exposure to occur. 
1. Source 
2. Health hazard 
3. Exposure point 
4. Exposure medium 
5. Route of exposure 
6. Co-occurrence with a population-at-risk. 
A key task in preparing to conduct a risk assessment is to describe the EPs that the risk assessment will need to 
address. 
Within DOEHRS-IH, it is a best practice to manage information, data, and monitoring activities related to EPs in 
a way that bundles highly related known and potential EPs into a single EP sometimes referred to as a DOEHRS 
EP. For example, all EPs associated with a water system at a base camp are to be bundled together into a single 
DOEHRS EP for the water system that is displayed in the active CSM and/or OEHSA CSM. All the OEHSS 
guidance is based on this bundling approach. This operationalization of the EP concept simplifies documentation 
requirements, allows flexibility to deal with contingencies over time, reduces the need to constantly rework 
information, and creates a consistent information structure for communicating exposure monitoring and HRAs. 
This saves time for FHP personnel involved with OEHSS activities so that they can focus on resolving 
high-priority problems instead of routine documentation tasks. 
3.3.3 Conceptual Site Model Best Practices 
For each deployment location where OEHSS activities are performed, an active CSM of EPs should be built and 
managed through time within the environmental health (EH) module of DOEHRS-IH. The active CSM shown in 
Figure 3-3 is generally representative of the majority of CLs. The creation of an active CSM of EPs should 
proceed according to best practices developed and maintained by the OEHS Centers. Refer to Appendix C.

All EPs in an active CSM require a priority level to be established. The priority of an EP is based on the judgment 
of potential health risk posed by health hazards associated with the exposure. It is to be used as a guide for 
understanding and communicating its importance relative to other EPs in determining where, and how quickly, to 
employ OEH assets and resources including targeted hazard mitigation. The four priority levels are urgent, high, 
moderate, and low. Figure 3-4 defines the priority levels and provides general expectations for EPs linked to each 
level. An important aspect of this framework is that low-priority EPs do not require sampling and high- and 
urgent-priority EPs should be addressed with a commander’s risk acceptance memorandum (see 9.6) and 
mitigated as necessary. Appendix C provides guidance for how to prioritize EPs.

3.3.5 Conceptual Site Model Evolution 
The CSM should evolve over time as more data are collected and knowledge is gained at a deployment location. 
The evolution of the CSM involves improved documentation of actual exposure conditions that personnel 
experience at the location. Changing site conditions will need to be reflected in the structure and details of a 
location’s active CSM. Figure 3-5 illustrates the stages of CSM development and maintenance.

3.4 TYPES OF HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS 
There are several types of HRAs that can be produced during the OEHSS process for any given deployment 
location (Figure 3-6).

Type 
Description 
Rapid HRA 
• An optional activity typically reserved for FHP teams that have the 
necessary equipment and expertise to perform them. 
• Produced during, or immediately after, a site visit without reliance on 
reachback support from an OEHS Center. It represents a basic, 
screening-level assessment of a DOEHRS-IH EP that relies on-site 
observations, professional judgments, and data generated by field expedient 
methods. Ideally, any data used in the assessment will be generated via the 
execution of an R-SAP based on best practices published by the OEHS 
Centers. 
Enhanced HRA 
• An expected activity which follows the execution of an E-SAP. It is typically 
produced by an experienced FHP team and/or the OEHS Center. 
• Represents a more formal assessment of a DOEHRS IH EP that relies 
on-site observations, professional judgments, and data generated by 
analytical laboratories and/or advanced exposure models. Ideally, any data 
used in the assessment will be generated via the execution of an E-SAP 
based on best practices published by the OEHS Centers. 
Sitewide HRA (e.g., POEMS) 
• An optional activity depending on requirements identified by command 
headquarters or the OEHS Center. 
• Usually produced by the OEHS Center and/or an experienced FHP team. 
It represents a formal assessment of the exposure risks across multiple EPs 
associated with the deployment location over a specified time period. 
• A POEMS report is a version of a sitewide HRA. 
Note: Each of the above types of HRAs can be designed as a screening-level HRA. A formal HRA can be 
executed for an enhanced HRA or a sitewide HRA. The depth and complexity of analysis is the main difference 
between the HRA approaches. These differences are defined below. 
Screening-level HRA 
• One that uses preliminary data and information to determine if a more 
formal HRA may be necessary. Conservative (safe-sided) exposure 
guidelines referred to as screening levels are used in this type of HRA. 
Formal HRA 
• In the context of OEHSS, a formal HRA is one that uses more information 
and a larger (or more robust) data set in conjunction with a more specific set 
of exposure guidelines. Such HRAs are designed to provide, at a minimum, 
qualitative health-based operational risk estimates (e.g., low, moderate, high, 
and extremely high risk). Refer to 9.5 and 11.5 of Technical Guide 230, 
Environmental Health Risk Assessment and Chemical Exposure Guidelines 
for Deployed Military Personnel, for more information. 
Figure 3-6. Types of Health Risk Assessments 
3.5 EXPOSURE ESTIMATES AND GUIDELINES 
Exposure estimates are measurements or predictions of the level of exposure to a given health hazard. For 
example, over the course of a 24-hour period, a population of soldiers was exposed to chemical X at an average 
concentration of 100 milligrams per cubic meter of air (i.e., 100 mg/m3). Such an estimate is a 24-hour, 
time-weighted average exposure. Measurement datum is necessary to develop exposure estimates for particular 
health hazards. Chapter 4 provides guidance for generating measurement data. 
Exposure guidelines are hazard-specific environmental concentrations or measures of magnitude that are 
associated with a given level of health risk for defined exposure scenarios. Exposure guidelines can be 
categorized into tiers relative to importance or stature. For example, such guidelines can be referred to as criteria, 
standards, or guidelines. The terminology difference is important. Criteria and standards generally carry legal 
weight and are regulatory in nature, and guidelines tend to serve as consensus risk assessment recommendations. 
For OEHSS, the main exposure guidelines of interest vary by the type of health hazard being evaluated. For 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
 
3-9 
JAN 2023 
chemical exposures, the most often used guidelines are the military exposure guidelines (MEGs) published in 
Technical Guide 230. The comparison of site-specific exposure estimates for each health hazard to the appropriate 
exposure guideline is the crux of the risk assessments embedded within OEHSS process. The OEHS Centers 
provide consultative support for exposure guidelines and how they are to be used. 
3.6 HEALTH RISK ESTIMATES 
A health risk estimate is the main conclusion of an HRA, it is the most important of the risk judgments made 
during OEHSS (3.2 introduced the various risk judgments). It is a determination of the level of risk that a 
population is subject to in terms of the likelihood to experience adverse health effects associated with the hazards 
at the levels to which they were exposed. 
In the vast majority of cases during OEHSS, the risk estimate will be a determination of one of the four qualitative 
risk levels presented in Figure 3-7. The risk estimate should be determined by OEH personnel based on 
professional judgment using standard HRA methodologies specific to the EP and health hazards under 
investigation. One such method, for exposures to chemicals in air, water, and soil is Technical Guide 230. 
HRA methods are occasionally updated to reflect lessons learned, improved concepts, and advances in scientific 
understanding of exposure and health effects. Within OEHSS, when exposure guidelines are available (see 3.5), 
they are integral to the HRA method. The OEHS Centers provide guidance and consultative support for 
performing HRAs for the various EPs and health hazards.

Notes: 
1. The short-term and long-term risk levels are determined separately. The long-term risk level does not 
automatically equal the short-term risk level; they are determined by different types of risk assessments. 
2. Short-term effects risk is associated with effects that occur during the deployment period. Personnel may be 
grouped into different exposure categories (reflecting different exposure levels/durations/estimated severity of 
exposure). These different groups may each be designated with different risk levels.  
3. Long-term effects risk is associated with effects that either continue or first emerge after deployment. 
Personnel may be grouped into different exposure categories (reflecting different exposure 
levels/durations/estimated severity of exposure). These different groups may each be designated with different 
risk levels. It is recommended that long-term risk estimates be coordinated with an OEHS Center 
occupational/environmental physician.

CHAPTER 4 
Data Generation for Exposure Monitoring 
and Health Risk Assessment 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Exposure monitoring and HRA require the generation of measurements of exposure or potential exposure. Such 
measurement data can be generated by direct reading instruments (DRIs), field sampling and laboratory analyses 
(using either field confirmatory or theater validation laboratories, reachback support laboratories, and/or a 
definitive OEHS Center laboratory), exposure modeling, or a combination of all methods. Exposure estimation 
should be based on data generation plans, often referred to as sampling and analysis plans (SAPs). 
The primary objective of OEHSS data generation is to estimate exposure levels and characterize health risks 
associated with OEH threat sources and their health hazards. Data generation activities are best employed in a 
two-phased approach, whereby the first phase is to screen for potential exposures of concern and the second phase 
is to further characterize those exposures and the associated health risks. These two phases are embedded within 
the OEHSS processes. 
The first screening phase involves making rapid judgments about exposure and risk by setting EP priority levels 
(see Figure 3-4). These judgments may be based on employment of rapid field measurement capabilities if they 
are available to the deployed FHP team. If such rapid field screening capabilities are not available, EP priority 
levels are established using qualitative judgments based on-site visit observations and other information. 
The second characterization phase begins after an EP’s priority level is initially set to moderate, high, or urgent 
(see Figure 3-4). This phase involves additional and more advanced data collection techniques and typically 
results in an HRA (see Figure 3-6). Here the data generation goal is to produce quantitative estimates of health 
hazard exposure. The HRA process then compares the exposure estimates to guidelines, such as the MEGs, to 
characterize health risks. The data collection techniques associated with this phase typically include larger sample 
sizes and analytical laboratory analyses; however, all available data generation methods can and should be used 
depending on the level of concern, time available to perform the assessment, and available sampling equipment 
and other data generation capabilities. 
4.2 SAMPLING, ANALYSIS, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PLANS 
Data generation and exposure monitoring during OEHSS should proceed according to defined, written SAPs that 
address sampling strategies, sample management, laboratory analyses (field confirmatory, theater validation, 
definitive laboratory analysis), and associated quality assurance. As exposure concerns progress from being 
identified to the conduct of a formal HRA, the level of detail and sophistication of the SAP used to generate the 
data will necessarily need to increase. Due to the operational realities in the deployment environment, it is 
unreasonable to expect every FHP field team to independently develop and execute a robust SAP for each EP of 
concern at all the deployment locations under its purview. For some AORs, this can be a massive burden placed 
upon usually stretched FHP field teams during active contingency operations. Therefore, the OEHS Centers play 
an especially important role by developing best practices guidance and SAP templates for FHP teams to use 
during their OEHSS activities. Additionally, under certain circumstances, the OEHS Center may need to consult 
and/or collaborate with field teams in order to jointly develop and execute a sampling and analysis program. 
Most of the best practice SAP guidance that is available to the OEH community has been developed for 
regulatory and compliance-type risk management programs, without specific planning adaptations documented 
for adoption to OEHSS at deployment locations.

Appendix D provides general guidance for SAP development and information on how to access the most current 
guidance for OEHSS activities. Current data generation planning manuals prepared by the Service OEHS Centers 
provides Service-specific guidance. However, there have been significant OEHSS lessons learned and recent 
advances in professional best practices for OEH data generation and quality assurance that the OEHS Centers can 
translate into programmatic and site-specific approaches for OEHSS activities. Deployed FHP field teams should 
coordinate with their OEHS Center and Geographic CCMD Surgeons Office to obtain current, operationally 
practical SAP guidance and templates based on best practices. 
4.3 STRUCTURED PLANNING DOCUMENTS 
Controlling the data quality of OEH sampling and analysis that occurs at deployment locations worldwide is not a 
simple task. It involves many teams and individuals with a range of technical expertise and experience who work 
their tasks at different times and locations. Therefore, a hierarchical planning approach has been adopted in order 
to define common data quality expectations, establish expected planning documentation, and guide site-specific 
sampling plans and activities. Figure 4-1 illustrates the planning structure. 
A key feature of this planning approach is that it does not ask FHP field teams to be subject matter experts 
(SMEs) on the most current sampling and analysis methodologies, nor does it expect independent, 
time-consuming efforts to develop and execute robust SAPs all on their own. The approach is designed to base 
sampling and analysis tasks on current best practice recommendations in light of constraints of the deployment 
environment, make the planning process transparent for stakeholders, and facilitate ease of implementation for the 
dispersed, operationally challenged field sampling teams. The OEHS Centers establish common DQOs for 
sampling at deployment locations in order to establish broad expectations for data quality for OEHSS activities 
and to provide a foundation for standard deployment sample laboratory analyses and site-specific sampling plans. 
Structured planning documents, to include programmatic plans and model SAPs, are available at the OEHSS 
support website: https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/oehss.

4.4 SITE-SPECIFIC SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS PLANS 
Within the OEHSS framework, there are two types of site-specific SAPs, as defined below. Guidance for both, 
and the available current model SAP templates, can be obtained from the OEHS Centers (see Appendix D). 
1. R-SAP. A site-specific plan that relies on organic field equipment and that can be developed and executed 
by a deployed FHP team without consultation with an OEHS Center. It typically relies on DRI and field 
screening and/or theater level analytical laboratory capabilities. An R-SAP can be used during an OEHSA 
survey site visit to assist in the initial prioritization of an EP, or during any site visit that occurs during 
OSEM activities. 
2. E-SAP. A site-specific plan that represents what might be considered a normal SAP. It does not 
necessarily rely on organic field equipment, as equipment augmentations may be required to execute the 
plan. Typically, FHP teams will need to collaborate with the OEHS Centers to develop and execute an 
E-SAP because its construction requires more advanced skillsets than are typical for most deployed FHP 
teams. While execution of the field sampling elements of an E-SAP might be performed by organic FHP 
personnel, the full plan and the supporting laboratory analysis elements will require participation or even 
oversight by theater laboratory assets and/or OEHS Center personnel.

CHAPTER 5 
Occupational and Environmental Health 
Exposure Incidents and Site Surveillance 
5.1 EXPOSURE INCIDENT REPORTS 
Incident reports are triggered by OEH incidents that result in exposures with either acute illness or the potential to 
cause latent illness. The reporting of OEH exposure incidents is required, and essential, in order to support an 
investigation and health surveillance for potentially exposed personnel (see DHA-PI 6490.03). Such reports are 
documented in the Incident Reporting module of DOEHRS-IH. Appendix E provides details for OEH exposure 
incident reports. 
5.2 IMPLEMENTATION OF EXPOSURE INCIDENT CRITERIA 
Incident reports should be prepared for exposure incidents if at least one of the six criteria in Figure 5-1 is met. 
The determination of whether an OEH exposure is significant enough to be considered an exposure incident is 
subjective. During OEHSS, it is possible that an exposure incident will occur and lead to the need to create a new 
EP or be associated with one that was already established. Appendix E provides guidance for implementing these 
criteria during OEHSS. 
OEH Exposure Incident Criteria 
1. Visual/sensory cues are, or were, present indicating potential presence of an OEH hazard (e.g., 
smoke/cloud, odors, strange liquid/powders, etc.). 
2. The presence of an acute OEH hazard is indicated through positive detection using real-time field 
equipment (e.g., direct reading instruments, joint chemical agent detector, improved chemical agent monitor, 
M8 chemical detector paper, or M256 chemical agent detector kit). 
3. Evaluation of data by an appropriate medical/health professional indicates that exposure could plausibly 
result in some significant adverse health outcome, either short- or long-term. 
4. Incident results in a significant exposure to any deployed individual(s), including from chemical, biological, 
radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents and acutely toxic industrial chemicals. 
5. The presence of a health hazard is plausibly associated with actual observed (acute) clinical health 
outcomes that are reported and/or treated (e.g., complaints of headaches, dizziness, skin or eye 
irritation/burning, coughing, nausea, etc.). 
6. Concern over a perceived or potential adverse health exposure leads to involvement of preventive 
medicine (PVNTMED [also referred to as Operational Public Health]) assets and military leadership for 
investigation, assessment, determination and response. Document these actions as an incident report even 
when there is a determination that no adverse exposures or impacts to human health are expected. 
Note: 
These criteria are sourced directly from DHA-PI 6490.03.

CHAPTER 6 
Documentation and the System of Record 
The DOEHRS-IH is a DOD application funded, developed, and maintained by the Military Health System. It is 
the DOD system of record used to manage unclassified OEH data, including selected public health data, for 
garrison and deployment operations. DOEHRS-IH is also the DOD’s system of records for informing OEH risk 
management, as well as a foundational system for the ILER. 
DOEHRS-IH is located at: https://doehrs-ih.csd.disa.mil/Doehrs. 
DOEHRS-IH is a common access card (CAC)-enabled, web-based system containing seven business areas often 
referred to as modules: Industrial Hygiene (IH), EH, Food Protection, Radiation, Incident Reporting, Registries, 
and Document Library. It also includes a module for filtering and reporting data from these areas. 
The documentation of the OEHSS information and data occurs in the EH business area of DOEHRS-IH. The EH 
business area is designed to capture location-specific surveillance data related to OEH hazards and facility 
sanitation. This business area’s components include features for documenting OEHSA surveys and associated 
surveillance activities for air, water, soil, thermal stress, entomology, food sanitation, general sanitation, and 
waste management. 
The business objects reporting feature in DOEHRS-IH allows users to conduct data queries and trend analysis. 
Users are able to view current and historical data either discretely or collectively, including laboratory results for 
food and environmental samples collected in theater and processed through a military public health laboratory. 
Unclassified surveillance, inspection, and sampling data associated with each of the DOEHRS-IH business areas 
can be entered in DOEHRS-IH whenever a CAC-enabled unclassified computer with internet connectivity is 
available. 
When connectivity is not available, information can be collected on documents available from the DOEHRS-IH 
resources support website (https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/envirohealth/hrasm/pages/doehrs_resources.aspx). 
At the time connectivity is reestablished, an electronic record is created in DOEHRS-IH, datum is entered, and the 
original paper document can be scanned and posted to the official DOEHRS-IH record. 
Prior to DOEHRS-IH use, training is highly recommended for navigating, entering data, and retrieving 
information from the system. Training is available through the OEHS Centers. 
Note 
No classified OEHSS information or data should be entered into the DOEHRS-IH. 
Any information that could cause an OEHSS-related report to be classified should be 
submitted separately according to CCMD and Service-specific guidance and/or 
submitted to the APHC’s internal Military Exposure Surveillance Library (MESL) 
(oehs.data.army@mail.smil.mil).

CHAPTER 7 
Planning Site Surveillance 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
As described in Figure 1-2, planning occurs before deployment. The goal is to identify and organize assets and 
receive predeployment training, conduct initial planning for all assigned sites, and either initiate the OEHSA 
survey process (for new locations) or review the previously completed OEHSS components (for preexisting 
locations). 
7.2 SURVEILLANCE ASSETS, CAPABILITIES, AND LEVELS OF SUPPORT 
Appendix A summarizes the Services’ deployment teams and capabilities that perform OEHSS. No matter what 
teams are performing OEHSS activities within an AOR, successful surveillance will often require some degree of 
collaborative support from an OEHS Center (see 1.3). The support staff and SMEs at these centers provide 
consultative advice, guidance for crafting site-specific SAPs, authoritative analytical laboratory services, data 
quality review, and expert assessments for problems beyond the capabilities of a field team. 
7.3 INITIAL SURVEILLANCE PLANNING 
Surveillance planning involves several focus areas. First is the review and validation of deployment team’s 
skillsets and capabilities. This may require predeployment technical assistance, refresher training, and 
performance exercises using deployment team equipment SKO. 
The second focus area is where lines of communication are established between higher headquarters, deployment 
teams, specialized theater assets (if they exist), and the supporting OEHS Center. 
Lastly, the team should develop an overall approach for conducting its OEHSS activities across all assigned sites. 
It involves the when and where planning considerations for the entire area of operations (AO) to which the FHP 
team is deploying. This includes all of the deployment locations within the AO that will require some level of 
surveillance by the team. 
7.4 SITE-SPECIFIC PLANNING 
During site-specific planning, the deployment team educates itself about each of the deployment locations for 
which it will be responsible. The purpose of this planning is to identify as much information as possible 
concerning potential OEH threats associated with a particular deployment location before arrival on site. This 
involves reviewing existing site assessments produced by Engineer Operations for each deployment location, such 
as the EBS, ECRs, and ESCSs. See 7.4.1 for the engineers’ EBS and other site conditions reports. 
While some site-specific planning activities are slightly different for new versus existing sites, engaging with 
Engineer Operations personnel should always be a key activity for deploying FHP personnel. 
Note 
A new site is a deployment location where an OEHSA survey has not yet been 
conducted.

7.4.1 Engineers’ Environmental Baseline Survey 
The deploying FHP team should coordinate with the existing FHP team in the AOR and/or Engineer Operations 
personnel and obtain and review existing assessments for the site. The EBS is typically the most important 
assessment to review and understand. This section provides an overview of Engineer Operations doctrine and the 
assessments that should be used by FHP teams to understand site conditions to support the creation of the FHP 
team’s OEHSA survey. 
ATP 3-34.5/MCRP 3-40B.2 provides Army and USMC doctrine for integrating environmental considerations into 
operations and for documenting environmental conditions throughout the operational phases of a deployment 
location. AFI 32-7020 provides USAF doctrine for environmental considerations and conducting an EBS. 
The EBS and ESCS are completed using the following forms. If available, FHP should obtain these completed 
forms, and other documentation that adequately describes the environmental conditions, and use them to inform 
its planning at each deployment location. 
1. DD Form 2993 (EBS checklist) is completed during the planning phase of a contingency operation and for 
each potential deployment location. It is used to thoroughly document the environmental conditions of a site 
prior to selecting and occupying the deployment location. 
2. DD Form 2994 (EBS report) is also completed during the planning phase of a contingency operation, for 
each EBS checklist, and is used to summarize and highlight those conditions identified in the checklist that 
potentially impact the site’s selection, use, and planning as a deployment location. 
3. DD Form 2995 (ESCS) is completed at least three times during the transfer/closure process of a 
deployment location. It is used to determine necessary closure actions and resources, as well as documenting 
the final environmental conditions at the CL at the time of transfer/closure. 
An EBS should be completed before a deployment location is selected and occupied. If this is not possible, it 
should be completed within 30 days of site occupation. This survey helps to accomplish three primary goals: the 
documentation of initial site conditions, ID of hazards and risk factors, and determination of site selection and 
layout. Documenting initial site conditions helps to prevent liability to the U.S. Government for damage or 
contamination that was present before site occupation. Also, by identifying existing environmental hazards and 
potential health risks during the planning phase of a contingency operation, the overall suitability of a site can be 
used in the site selection process, and concerns can possibly be mitigated with proper planning. For example, 
water or soil contamination, air pollution, poor site drainage, and improper waste management are environmental 
hazards and health risk factors that impact site suitability and planning. Hazards may be generated on and off the 
survey site, and include both those impacting personnel on the survey site and those impacting the surrounding 
indigenous populations and institutions. The survey can help planners determine the best site layout, including 
locations (from an environmental and health standpoint) for life support areas, maintenance, sanitation, hazardous 
material storage, etc. 
Additional information documented in an EBS includes descriptions about site occupants, physical characteristics 
of the land, current and previous site uses, current and previous uses of adjacent properties, structures and roads, 
power generation, hazardous materials, waste management, historical and cultural resources, nonpest and pest 
species, noise, air quality, and water. Completion of the EBS requires personnel with the necessary technical 
training and expertise to identify potential hazards and may require the collection of various air, soil, and water 
samples. FHP personnel can obtain environmental documentation, like an EBS, and information, like site-specific 
environmental considerations, from the CCMD engineering and environmental staff. 
7.4.2 Site-specific Planning for New Sites 
In addition to coordinating with Engineer Operations personnel and their existing assessments (see 7.4.1), 
site-specific planning for new sites involves conducting (or obtaining) the PLHA and initiating the first OEHSA 
survey. 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
 
7-3 
JAN 2023 
7.4.2.1 Preliminary Hazard Assessment 
For new deployment locations (i.e., without any previous OEHSA survey), conduct a PLHA. If the deployment 
team does not prepare a PLHA, it should contact the CCMD force health protection officer (FHPO) in order to 
obtain one. 
A PLHA is a document that summarizes relevant intelligence data, past hazard assessments, and all other 
available information for a new deployment location for the purpose of early ID of potential OEH threats and risk 
management countermeasures prior to deploying to a newly established location. It serves as the starting point for 
an understanding of the OEH threats and hazards that may exist at a site for which military personnel have very 
little knowledge. It aids in the development of health risk communication messages, the initial health threat 
briefing, and first OEHSA survey. Once the first OEHSA survey has been completed, a PLHA is no longer 
needed. The following seven sections of a PLHA mirror the sections of the OEHSA survey: 
1. General Location Information: Describes the conditions at the proposed location and provides relevant 
information about what is known or has been reported about local hazards or conditions. 
2. Subsistence (Food/Water): Identifies the general sanitary practices of the local food supply and municipal 
potable water system to help answer address concerns of deployed personnel eating or drinking on the local 
economy. 
3. Endemic Threats: Identifies the infectious diseases that could impact deployed personnel, necessary 
immunizations and countermeasures needed for prevention, and zoological threats that could cause 
operational concern. 
4. Ambient Air Quality: Identifies what is known or has been reported about general ambient air quality to 
help answer questions about pollution sources in the deployment area and whether special air sampling 
equipment needs exist for deployed FHP teams. 
5. Radiological Hazards: Identifies the radiological sources that exist within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the 
proposed location. 
6. Health Concerns from Past/Current Land Use: Describes how the land has been used over the past 3 years 
and documents suspected or known major chemical spills or contamination. 
7. Industrial Operations: Identifies industries in the surrounding area and suspected or known contamination 
associated with these industries. 
The PLHA is accomplished by reviewing all available and relevant information about the deployment location. 
Most of the information needed to complete a PLHA can be obtained using sources that are readily available to 
the general public and a few CAC-enabled websites. Classified datum is generally not required but can be 
obtained as necessary. Gathering health threat data for a specific location prior to visiting the site can be quite 
challenging and further complicated if there is a short turnaround time. Much of the available data address 
regional threats rather than those specific to the local area. Remotely collected data may prove to be unreliable or 
outdated. These PLHA limitations are addressed by generating site-specific information and knowledge during 
the first OEHSA survey. 
Although much of the information contained in the PLHA is unclassified, once the information is aggregated and 
locations identified, it may require a different classification. All established policies and procedures should be 
followed to ensure the proper handling of potentially classified information. 
Unclassified PLHAs should be saved in the EH module of DOEHRS-IH by uploading it as an attachment to the 
Location–Detail page for the location. Contact APHC to add a new location in the DOEHRS-IH. Classified 
PLHAs should be submitted to the APHC internal MESL (oehs.data.army@mail.smil.mil).

7.4.2.2 Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment Survey Initiation for New Sites 
For new sites, the first OEHSA survey should be initiated during this planning step. The information obtained 
from the PLHA and the engineer s’ EBS can be used to initiate the documentation of OEH conditions at the 
deployment location. This information will be preliminary in nature until FHP personnel can perform a site visit 
and verify actual conditions on the ground. Service FHP personnel should make a substantial effort to identify as 
many of the potential OEH threats associated with on- and off-site sources before arrival at a site. This is the 
beginning of the OEHSA survey process and includes the generation of a preliminary CSM. 
7.4.2.2.1 Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment Survey Elements 
At this point in the process, it can be reasonably expected that existing OEH information may be limited, 
depending on current or past operations conducted at the location. However, an extensive search to obtain general 
information concerning the location should be accomplished in order to begin the documentation for each of the 
OEHSA survey sections (see Appendix B for a summary of the sections). 
Figure 7-1 identifies some typical questions that Service FHP personnel should attempt to answer before arriving 
on site. The amount of lead time available prior to the deployment will largely affect the amount of information 
that can be obtained. During this process, the OEHSA survey template should be used as a guide to collect 
information. Keep in mind that available information may only be descriptive of the country or region and not 
specific to the deployment location. Service FHP personnel should make an effort to complete as much of the 
OEHSA survey template as possible. 
Sources of information to answer the questions shown in Figure 7-1 can be varied. Much of the information can 
be extracted from the PLHA and, if completed, the engineers’ EBSs and other environmental conditions reports. 
Additional information sources can be vast and should not be restricted. Prior to predeployment surveillance 
planning (see 7.3), Service FHP personnel should have already contacted their headquarters’ Service component 
command FHPO, CCMD FHPO, and/or their OEHS Center to assist in gathering relevant information for all 
deployment locations for which they are planning OEHSA surveys. 
Google Earth and similar open-source satellite mapping tools contain surprisingly accurate overhead visual 
layouts of most geographic areas. These mapping tools can aid in identifying potential sources of OEH threats 
(e.g., large industry, major emission sources, lakes, lagoons) surrounding the deployed site. Figure 7-2 provides 
an example of a Google Earth visual layout of Balad Air Base, Iraq. The program has a more refined resolution as 
you zoom in to an area of the base. This image gives Service FHP personnel a visual of the base before arrival, 
allowing the assessor to start formulating a site reconnaissance approach. 
Data on the prevailing wind is another critical piece of information that Service FHP personnel need to aid in 
identifying potential OEH exposure concerns. Wind direction and speed play a pivotal role in the migration of 
OEH health hazards. Information on prevailing winds can be obtained from the supporting meteorological 
detachment or weather squadron and open-source weather sources. A wind rose shows how wind speed and 
direction are typically distributed at a particular site. Presented in a circular format, as in Figure 7-3, the wind rose 
shows the frequency of winds blowing from a particular direction. The wind rose may not be available for every 
deployment location. In which case, Service FHP personnel may use wind information from a nearby airfield or 
airport as representative data for the site. However, the greater the distance this information source is from the 
site, the less accurate it may be in representing site-specific characteristics. 
Service FHP personnel should begin documenting the gathered OEHSA survey information using DOEHRS-IH. 
The extent of the information and documentation will be directly related to the amount of lead time available prior 
to the deployment. The development of a preliminary CSM is a key deliverable associated with predeployment 
OEHSA survey planning for new sites. Based on the gathered information and the preliminary CSM (see 7.4.2.2), 
Service FHP personnel should begin to formulate courses of action needed soon after arrival at the deployed 
location, such as prioritizing site reconnaissance and interviews to address the more important OEH concerns first 
(e.g., specific threat or source located upwind of living areas).

JAN 2023 
1. Are there U.S. personnel already present at the deployed location? How many? (If there are no personnel 
currently on site, the scope of the OEHSA will change to identifying any OEH threat sources at the site and 
allow Service FHP personnel to make recommendations concerning site layout to minimize exposure 
potential to existing OEH threats.) 
2. What is the primary mission of the site? (Provide insight into the following: weapon systems present or 
planned, industrial workplaces present or planned, and OEH threats associated with these operations.) 
3. What are the primary activities performed on the location? Will there be specific at-risk populations as a 
result of these activities? 
4. What types of geography, topography, and/or meteorological conditions are associated with the site 
(urban/rural area, temperature range, predominant wind direction, etc.)? 
5. What are the agricultural or industrial operations adjacent to the site? (Obtain information on typical OEH 
threats from these operations and confirm appropriate screening capability on site.) 
6. What types of structures are on site (temporary/permanent structures, types of housing, etc.)? 
7. How will these structures be used during the current mission? What were the prior uses of these 
structures? Are intended uses compatible with prior uses? 
8. What is the historical use of the land prior to current site development and use? (Provides insight to 
possible soil contamination [e.g., agricultural, industrial].) 
9. Are there other water sources (above/below ground) on or near the site that may be utilized for purposes 
other than drinking water (i.e., sewage lagoons, cooling ponds for industrial uses, irrigation ditches, 
livestock watering holes, etc.)? Are there potential health hazards associated with those water sources, 
(i.e., agricultural runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers, animal/human waste, industrial discharges into 
the water source that may contain heavy metals, etc.)? What are the drinking water sources? How is the 
distribution system setup? (Identify typical drinking water sources and possible health risks to common 
water contaminants in country.) 
10. What is the security posture of the environment near the location? (An environment with active 
insurgents/terrorists could increase the likelihood of drinking water contamination and/or toxic industrial 
chemical release.)

7.4.2.2.2 Preliminary Conceptual Site Model  
As illustrated in Figure 3-5, a key part of the initial planning for the OEHSA survey is generating a preliminary 
CSM of EPs. This CSM should identify all of the probable and potential EPs the team thinks might need to be 
established for the location. These pathways should be based on all the gathered information from the PLHA, 
EBS, and other sources. EPs should generally not be generated within DOEHRS-IH at this step in the process. 
Rather, a preliminary CSM should be crafted and used to structure plans for the site visit. There are three key 
features of preliminary CSMs: 
1. Preliminary CSMs are not recorded in DOEHRS-IH. They are planning tools used to structure FHP team 
site visit activities and to project what EPs might eventually get created within DOEHRS-IH. 
2. Preliminary CSMs do not include all EP details. They are limited to the type of content in the example 
CSM shown in Figure 3-3. Additional details are not needed at this planning step. 
3. Preliminary CSMs do not include any EP priority levels. The priority levels will be established by the team 
after the initial site visit once actual site conditions are verified by the FHP team.  
Note 
Once an EP is created in the active CSM area of DOEHRS-IH, a priority level is 
required. 
7.4.3 Site-specific Planning for Existing Sites 
For existing sites where an OEHSA survey has already been conducted and OSEM activities have been on-going, 
the predeployment, site-specific planning step involves gaining a full understanding of site conditions as 
described by others, initiating the next OEHSA survey, and comprehending the OSEM plans and data generation 
activities. 
This is accomplished by reviewing previously completed OEHSS components, such as the previous OEHSA 
survey, recent OEH status checklists, the current active CSM of EPs as recorded in DOEHRS-IH, existing and 
active OSEM monitoring strategies and SAPs, and any HRAs previously conducted for the location. In summary, 
the following are expected for an FHP team planning to perform OEHSS activities at an existing location: 
1. Communicate with out-going FHP team for lessons learned and OEH issues and concerns. 
2. Communicate with OEHS Center for historical site knowledge and best practices. 
3. Review existing engineers’ EBS and other site conditions reports. 
4. Review and understand previous OEHSA survey and the active CSM of EPs. 
5. Review and understand other information documented within DOEHRS-IH. 
6. Review and understand existing OSEM plans and findings. 
7. Initiate the OEHSA survey within DOEHRS-IH. 
A key enabling success factor for site-specific planning for existing sites is early communication with the current, 
out-going FHP team. They can provide all the information documentation and other lessons learned to the 
in-coming FHP team.

CHAPTER 8 
Preparation for Occupational and 
Environmental Health Site Assessments 
8.1 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT SURVEY 
PREPARATION FOR NEW AND EXISTING SITES 
As described in Figure 1-2, preparation occurs during deployment and improves the ability to conduct OEHSS 
activities, to include preparing for specific site visits and refining SAPs. 
Once in theater, Service FHP personnel prepare for conducting site visits and performing the first OEHSA survey 
at each deployment location for which they are expected to conduct OEHSS activities. At new sites, this is the 
first OEHSA survey to be conducted. At existing sites, this will be the first OEHSA survey conducted by the 
in-coming Service FHP team. 
8.2 GENERAL SURVEY PREPARATIONS 
Preparing for the OEHSA survey site visit generally involves establishing the tools and activity plans for 
conducting interviews, site visit reconnaissance, validation of EPs in the preliminary CSM (new sites) or active 
CSM (existing sites), and initial prioritization of those EPs.  
Note 
Some EPs can be immediately assessed via the execution of an R-SAP. 
Additional activities that can occur at this point are generating requests for support from specialized assets that 
may already be in theater (such as area medical laboratory support) and preparing the FHP team’s approach to 
conducting rapid (on-site) HRAs, if they are to be performed. 
While preparing for these activities, the FHP team can update the draft OEHSA survey in DOEHRS-IH based on 
all the information gathered. Completing as much of the OEHSA survey as possible prior to the site visit can 
speed up the timeline for survey completion. Additionally, the preliminary CSM may be able to be partially 
validated and/or updated after learning more about the site when performing initial email or phone interviews of 
deployed personnel prior to arriving for the site visit. 
The Service FHP team should engage with higher headquarters on the following: 
1. General review of OEHSA survey requirements and procedures 
2. Review of the location’s preliminary CSM 
3. Establishment of the required activities during the site visit 
4. OEHSA survey key activities and timelines: 
a. Finalization of CSM EPs to be documented in DOEHRS-IH 
b. Documentation of any R-SAPs executed while on site along with the findings 
c. Performance and documentation of any rapid HRAs while on site 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
8-2 
 
d. Site visit OEHSS out-briefs to include immediate recommendations 
e. OEHSA survey completion and review tasks. 
8.3 PREPARE TO UPDATE THE CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL OF EXPOSURE PATHWAYS 
During OEHSA survey preparation, Service FHP personnel can start building the active CSM in DOEHRS-IH, as 
shown in Figure 3-5. Performing this activity during OEHSA preparation is optional and, if performed, should 
temporarily set all of the EP priority levels to low. After the site visit, the FHP team would revise its pathway 
prioritization based on actual site conditions observed during the site visit. 
Documentation of CSM EPs within DOEHRS-IH should occur in the active CSM area of DOEHRS-IH (see 3.3.1 
and 3.3.5). After the EPs have been built in the active CSM, they will later be associated to various sections of the 
OEHSA survey. Detailed EP documentation should follow CSM best practices (refer to Appendix C). 
8.4 PREPARE RAPID SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS PLANS 
During OEHSA survey preparation, the FHP team considers the need for developing R-SAPs for its site visit. 
Ensuring its equipment is ready for such an activity is an important preparation step. During the initial OEHSA 
survey, the primary function of an R-SAP is to assist in the initial prioritization of an EP. These plans should be 
designed to use field measurement capabilities such as DRIs while performing site reconnaissance. Examples of 
an R-SAP in action during a site visit includes the following: 
1. Field confirmatory testing of base camp water systems to compare water quality to short-term potability 
standards 
2. Area measurements of noise levels using sound level meters. 
Best practices for R-SAP development and execution will evolve over time as capabilities are advanced and 
lessons learned are translated into improved techniques. Preparation for this activity is important and should 
involve obtaining up-to-date guidance from the OEHS Centers. Guidance and model SAP templates are provided 
by the Service OEHS Centers and made available at the OEHSS support website: 
https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/oehss. 
Note 
An R-SAP is a SAP that can be generated and executed by Service FHP teams without 
reachback support from a Service OEHS Center. Refer to 4.4 for background 
information. 
8.5 PREPARE FOR OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE SURVEILLANCE 
STATUS BRIEFINGS 
At the end of each site visit, an out-brief should be provided with the status of the OEH conditions at the location 
to the base camp commander/BOS-I. During OEHSA survey preparation, the FHP team should develop an 
approach for completing the OEHSS status briefing. The primary goal of the OEH status briefing is to highlight 
the most important OEH findings that require risk management attention. An optional OEHSS status checklist can 
be used to support the development of the briefing. The checklist can be used by FHP personnel who perform 
OEHS and inspections to summarize findings and recurring reassessments over time. Appendix F provides an 
overview of the briefing template and checklist, which covers the following assessment areas: 
1. OEHSA survey 
2. Water

9. Noise hazards 
10. Air quality 
11. Soil contamination 
12. OSEM activities 
13. Service-specific elements 
14. Camp clinic and other concerns. 
8.6 RAPID HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS (OPTIONAL) 
A rapid HRA is an optional activity typically reserved for experienced FHP teams with the necessary equipment 
and expertise to perform them. Figure 3-6 defines a rapid HRA in contrast to an enhanced HRA. A rapid HRA is 
produced during, or immediately after, a site visit without reliance on reachback support from a Service OEHS 
Center. It represents a basic, screening-level assessment of a DOEHRS EP that relies on-site observations, 
professional judgments, and data generated by field expedient methods. Ideally, any data used in the assessment 
will be generated via the execution of an R-SAP based on best practices published by the OEHS Centers. 
During OEHSA survey preparation, the FHP team considers the need for performing rapid HRAs during or 
immediately after its site visit. Developing the HRA approach and ensuring its equipment is ready for such an 
activity is an important preparation.

CHAPTER 9 
Execution of Occupational and 
Environmental Health Site Assessments 
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
The deployment location site visit represents the beginning of the execution phase of the OEHSA survey. The site 
visit and associated activities are all based on predeployment planning (see Chapter 7), active deployment 
preparation for the OEHSA survey (see Chapter 8), and observations and surveillance decisions made during the 
site visit. In summary, execution of the OEHSA survey involves the following activities: 
1. Ground truthing and perform site interviews and reconnaissance. 
2. Validate or revise the active CSM of EPs. 
3. Execute R-SAPs and generate data. 
4. Perform rapid HRAs. 
5. Identify risk management options for potentially unacceptable risks. 
6. Complete DOEHRS-IH documentation details and remaining portions of the OEHSA survey. 
7. Perform OEHSA survey quality assurance review and approval tasks. 
Site interviews and reconnaissance allow Service FHP personnel to understand OEH conditions at the deployment 
location, identify and/or validate OEH threats associated with the location, and identify and/or validate active 
CSM EPs. The primary objective of interviews and reconnaissance is to identify and visually verify the existing 
OEH conditions at the site that could negatively impact the health of personnel. Site reconnaissance and 
interviews allow Service FHP personnel to cultivate what was learned in both the predeployment planning and 
early deployment preparation phases, generate more detailed information, and identify other potential sources of 
OEH threats. 
OEHSA survey information and data can become classified. Service FHP personnel must be aware of what data 
or information can cause the OEHSA survey to become classified (e.g., vulnerabilities, recording grid 
coordinates, including maps of the site, and photographs of potentially high-interest facilities). Service FHP 
personnel should consult with the appropriate original classification authority guidance and procedures for 
classification and distribution. 
Note 
Within DOEHRS-IH, the start and stop dates for an OEHSA survey should correspond 
to the dates of the actual initial site visit and last date content within the survey was 
added or revised. The stop date may be modified during the survey quality assurance 
(QA) process if changes are needed to achieve a QA-approved status. The duration of 
any given OEHSA survey (i.e., the duration between the OEHSA survey start and stop 
dates) will vary. A general rule is that an initial OEHSA survey can be prepared and 
marked “Ready for QA” within 2 to 30 days, and subsequent OEHSA surveys 
prepared and marked “Ready for QA” within 1 to 10 days. There is flexibility in 
deciding when to stop an OEHSA survey. Waiting until the end of an FHP team’s 
deployment cycle is an option, but not the general expectation for all Services.

9.2 SITE INTERVIEWS 
Service FHP personnel should conduct interviews with personnel who are familiar with the deployed location and 
its historical land use. Interviews are necessary to obtain site information that may not have been previously 
available and/or to validate previously collected information identified in the OEHSA survey template. Interviews 
should be conducted before reconnaissance, when able (see Chapter 8), and can be continued during and after 
reconnaissance to clarify information on potential sources of OEH threats. Credible, knowledgeable individuals 
may be on hand for established locations; however, these individuals may not be readily available for a site 
without existing infrastructure. Figure 9-1 lists organizations/personnel from which Service FHP personnel can 
gain valuable information required to complete the OEHSA survey. Interviews with host nation liaisons may 
provide a wealth of information pertaining to local or surrounding industries or sources of OEH threats at the site, 
and may provide insight on historical land use.

9.3 SITE VISIT RECONNAISSANCE 
Service FHP personnel should request that personnel who have historical knowledge of the site, and other SMEs 
from the organizations providing base operating support (see Figure 9-1), participate in the on-site 
reconnaissance. The major objectives of reconnaissance are to identify and verify existing occupational and 
environmental conditions at, or adjacent to, the site that could impact the health of personnel. Furthermore, 
Service FHP personnel should be on the lookout for industrial operations that are conducted inside and outside the 
wire of the deployment location. If, in the professional judgment of the lead FHP professional, the OEH threats 
associated with these operations may pose an immediate health threat, actions should be taken to preclude or 
avoid unnecessary OEH exposures. 
One of the first steps of site reconnaissance is to obtain or update the current map of the area (e.g., aerial or 
satellite photographs). This can usually be obtained from the PLHA or the EBS. Obtaining on-site and off-site 
maps to support site reconnaissance is vital. Photographs also provide excellent documentation. Obtain approval 
prior to taking photographs, if necessary, and be careful not to include photographs that may change the 
classification of the OEHSA. All photographs must have a good description depicting the context of the photo 
(e.g., "This picture depicts the burn pit from the closest occupied work center, 250 meters SSW of the pit.”). 
When conducting reconnaissance, Service FHP personnel should focus on potential OEH threats identified in the 
preliminary CSM (for new site) or active CSM (for existing sites), living areas, and/or primary work locations. 
However, the site reconnaissance should span every area of the site in order to identify additional OEH threat 
sources. As part of the site reconnaissance, all buildings and industrial areas within the deployment location 
should be systematically visited. Passive observations of hazard threat sources outside the wire (e.g., industrial 
emissions and noise) should be documented. No attempt should be made to actively surveil or investigate 
activities outside the wire due to legal considerations (e.g., Geneva Convention limitations). 
Service FHP personnel shall drive or walk the inside perimeter of the site to identify the boundaries of the site, 
recording the military grid reference system coordinates for the corners, and estimating the total area occupied by 
the site. The site reconnaissance must be extensive enough to identify all outfalls or potential incoming sources of 
pollution that may affect personnel living and working on the site. The list below outlines some key items, areas, 
and hazard sources that Service FHP personnel must look for and describe during site reconnaissance. The 
majority of these are covered in the OEHSA survey (see Appendix B). 
1. Building’s exterior/interior conditions 
2. Storage tanks (above and below ground) 
3. Pits, ponds, or lagoons 
4. Current use (adjacent properties) 
5. Pools of liquid 
6. Stained soil 
7. Geology, hydrology, topography 
8. Drums 
9. Stressed vegetation 
10. Type of roads 
11. Unidentified containers 
12. Ambient air conditions 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
 
9-5 
JAN 2023 
13. Signage indicating hazardous material use/storage areas 
14. Water source 
15. Wastewater and storm water disposal methods. 
Site perimeter reconnaissance provides an opportunity to identify potential off-site industrial operations that could 
impact site operations. As a minimum, any major industrial operations identified in the PLHA should be recorded 
in the OEHSA survey along with observational notes added from the perimeter reconnaissance. Service FHP 
personnel should follow any Service specific guidance that dictates otherwise. 
Site reconnaissance includes entering/describing existing buildings/structures and identifying all key on-site 
industrial operations (e.g., maintenance and transportation), existing controls, and the frequency/duration these 
operations are performed. Industrial shops and potentially hazardous processes should be documented in the 
appropriate sections of the OEHSA survey. Service FHP personnel should observe all operations or processes to 
determine whether or not these processes have the potential to affect another population outside the workplace. 
Note 
Formal IH programs may be established for some ELs due to their size, infrastructure 
maturity, and longevity (see 2.1). In such cases, these workplaces should be identified 
in the OEHSA survey by a comment that exposure monitoring activities for those 
workplaces are captured in the IH module of DOEHRS-IH rather than within the EH 
module for the ongoing monitoring. It is advisable that when this situation arises, 
requirements are clarified by higher headquarters. EPs that address IH workplaces 
SHOULD NOT be created when there is an IH program for the workplace. 
If the OEHSA survey represents the first FHP team visit to the site, responsibilities may include recommending 
ideal living and work locations for the site to eliminate or mitigate potential EPs. Temporary locations for 
sleeping and eating quarters, work locations, etc., may need to be quickly identified with the understanding that 
relocation may be necessary based on on-going OEHSS activities. In this situation, coordination should be made 
to reassess the site once the camp is established, preferably within 30 days, in order to determine additional 
potential EPs relevant to site configuration and operations. 
9.4 RAPID SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS PLAN EXECUTION 
During site visit reconnaissance, the FHP team should execute R-SAPs as part of its assessments of EPs 
previously identified during preparation and validated during reconnaissance. The findings should be used to help 
prioritize each EP. Using a model SAP template, an R-SAP can be completed and immediately executed by the 
FHP team while on site. Once completed, an R-SAP should be uploaded to the EP inside the active CSM within 
DOEHRS-IH. Information and data generated during the execution of R-SAPs should be used to perform an EP 
assessment and documented as such within DOEHRS-IH (refer to Appendix C). 
Note 
Initial prioritization of EPs does not always require execution of an R-SAP. Also, 
guidance and model SAP templates evolve over time as capabilities are advanced and 
lessons learned are translated into improved techniques. Preparation for this activity is 
important (see 8.4) and should involve obtaining up-to-date guidance from the OEHS 
Centers. 
9.5 CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL EXPOSURE PATHWAY PRIORITIZATION AND COMPLETION 
Based on the findings of the interviews, site reconnaissance and other information collection, and any rapid 
sampling and analysis, validated EPs should be established and prioritized (see Figure 3-4) during OEHSA survey 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
9-6 
 
execution. Initial priority levels should be assigned to each validated EP according to CSM best practices (see 
Appendix C, specifically C.7.). Final documentation of CSM EPs and their priority levels should occur in the 
active CSM area of DOEHRS-IH (see 3.3.1 and Figure 3-5). Detailed EP documentation should follow CSM best 
practices (see Appendix C). 
After the active CSM is completed, the FHP team associates each of the active CSM EPs to one or more sections 
within the OEHSA survey in DOEHRS-IH. All the EPs that have been associated to the sections of the survey 
will appear in the OEHSA CSM. This evolution of the CSM is reflected in Figure 3-5. 
Note 
Multiple EPs can be associated to a single OEHSA survey section and a single EP can 
be associated to multiple OEHSA survey sections. Within DOEHRS-IH, the OEHSA 
CSM will display all the EPs that have been associated to the survey. 
9.6 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE SURVEILLANCE STATUS BRIEFING 
AND RISK ACCEPTANCE MEMORANDA 
At the end of the OEHSA survey site visit, the FHP team provides an out-brief to the base camp commander 
and/or BOS-I referred to as the OEHSS status briefing (also referred to as the OEH status briefing). The primary 
goal of the OEH status briefing is to highlight the most important OEH findings that require risk management 
attention. The briefing should be designed to support the commander’s risk management process and identify 
when potential health risks for one or more EPs may require command attention. The OEH status briefing can be 
supported by the OEH status checklist, which can assist FHP personnel summarize site surveillance and sanitary 
inspection findings. Appendix F provides a briefing template and the checklist. 
When an EP is assigned a priority level of high or urgent (see Figure 3-4 for definitions), a commander’s risk 
acceptance memorandum shall be prepared. Consistent with the risk management requirements in DODI 6055.01, 
DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program and DODI 6490.03, the memorandum documents the 
commander’s decisions on whether to implement identified OEH risk mitigation recommendations. All risk 
acceptance memoranda should be adequately documented as part of the OEHSA survey within DOEHRS-IH. 
Updates to commanders’ decisions and their risk acceptance memoranda need to be documented in concert with 
each successive iteration of the OEHSA survey for a deployment location. Appendix G provides a suggested 
format and list of minimum elements for the memorandum. 
9.7 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT SURVEY CREATION 
By fully addressing each subject area within the OEHSA template (Appendix B), the FHP team will capture all 
the necessary information and data to complete the OEHSA survey. Development and completion of the survey is 
largely impacted by whether or not the FHP team has access to the DOEHRS-IH. It is highly recommended that 
the survey be completed online within DOEHRS-IH. 
During OEHSA survey execution, Service FHP teams should input all the collected information and data into the 
online OEHSA survey section of DOEHRS-IH. Once all the information, EPs, and associated data are entered 
into the online OEHSA survey, the DOEHRS-IH OEHSA survey should be marked “QA ready” and a review of 
the survey should commence. 
Service FHP teams without DOEHRS-IH access will have to generate the OEHSA survey manually. The 
completed OEHSA survey template (see Appendix B) will be the primary OEHSA information used to generate 
the assessment. At a minimum, the survey should include: an executive summary identifying significant OEH 
threats that have potential to affect one or more populations living/working on site, the operational mission and 
recommended courses of action, an OEHSA CSM of EPs that have been prioritized, and any limitations of the 
assessment due to time and operational mission constraints. The survey should be reviewed and approved by the 
FHP team’s approving official.

9-7 
JAN 2023 
9.8 OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SITE ASSESSMENT SURVEY REVIEW 
AND APPROVAL 
The CCMD FHPO is responsible for QA review and approval of the OEHSA survey. Review and/or approval 
may be delegated to the senior on-site FHP professional or elevated to a higher echelon FHP professional. If 
performed outside of DOEHRS, the approval must be documented in the OEHSA survey. 
Before submitting the OEHSA survey through the chain of command for final approval, the FHP team should 
seek a peer review through technical channels from Service FHP personnel on the joint task force (JTF) and 
Service component command surgeon staff. Additionally, peer review can also be conducted by the appropriate 
OEHS Center. 
Final approval of an online OEHSA survey is achieved when it is marked “QA approved” within DOEHRS-IH by 
the OEHSA survey approving official. If the OEHSA survey was prepared manually (outside of DOEHRS-IH), 
the FHP team should submit the approved OEHSA survey document to the DOEHRS-IH document library and 
notify the appropriate OEHS Center.  
Note 
Classified material should be submitted to the classified portal (refer to Chapter 6). 
Once the DOEHRS-IH OEHSA survey is approved, surveillance can focus on OSEM activities until the next 
OEHSA survey iteration is required. The survey can be generated electronically from within DOEHRS-IH and 
handled as a PDF or hardcopy document. 
9.9 RAPID HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS (OPTIONAL) 
As described in 8.6, only experienced FHP teams are expected to potentially perform rapid HRAs. These units 
have the training necessary to make reliable risk judgments using direct reading/field portable analytical 
instruments. Additionally, if theater laboratory capabilities are nearby, they can take samples and generate 
laboratory analytical results within days. Remote laboratories can also receive samples in order to begin analytical 
results generation process. It is recognized that remote laboratories may be able to produce results before the rapid 
HRA must be completed; however, the generated information can be used after the fact to further assessment of 
the original rapid HRA findings. Rapid HRAs should be planned for, practiced, and based on use of a documented 
R-SAP (see 9.4). Guidance for how to conduct rapid HRA can be obtained from the OEHS Centers. Once 
completed, a rapid HRA should be uploaded to the EP as an EP assessment inside the active CSM within 
DOEHRS-IH. Refer to Appendix C for best practice guidance for how to perform this action.

CHAPTER 10 
Preparation for On-going Site Exposure 
Monitoring 
10.1 GENERAL PREPARATION CONSIDERATIONS 
OSEM preparation activities begin when the OEHSA survey’s EPs have been formally documented and 
prioritized according to best practices guidance. Figures 1-3 and 1-4 illustrate the timing of OSEM preparation 
within the OEHSS process. 
At a minimum, OSEM activities will involve two tasks: 
1. Qualitative monitoring of all EPs looking for more information and/or changing conditions that may lead 
to an elevation or downgrading of exposure concerns for the pathway (i.e., reasons to change the priority level 
or stop-date the pathway). 
2. Tracking the conditions at the deployment location for the possible addition of new EPs. These tasks can 
occur during recurring site visits and/or via remote communications with location personnel (e.g., phone 
conversations and email). 
During the preceding OEHSA survey, when the priority level of one or more CSM EPs is moderate, high, or 
urgent (refer to Figure 3-4 for definitions), OSEM activities will also include consideration of quantitative 
exposure monitoring using E-SAPs along with follow-on HRAs. The development and execution of an E-SAP for 
an EP is not automatic. Refer to 10.4. 
10.2 SCHEDULE RECURRING SITE VISITS AND SITE SURVEILLANCE STATUS BRIEFINGS 
During OSEM preparation, FHP teams should establish a site visit schedule addressing all the deployment 
locations to which they are assigned. The frequency of site visits for any given location should be based on 
characteristics and purpose of the location, available time and resources, the range of priority levels within the 
active CSM and any E-SAPs, guidance from the Service component command’s FHP officer, and CCMD risk 
management guidance. 
During site visits to some locations, various degrees of E-SAP execution activities will need to be coordinated. 
E-SAP guidance and preparation tasks are addressed in 10.4. At the end of each site visit, provide a site 
surveillance status briefing (out-brief) to the base camp commander/BOS-I. Refer to 8.5 for general site 
surveillance status briefing preparation guidance. 
10.3 PREPARE TO UPDATE CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL OF EXPOSURE PATHWAYS 
During OSEM preparation, FHP teams should develop an approach for how they will translate the findings of 
their OSEM activities (both qualitative and quantitative monitoring) into updated CSM EP documentation within 
the active CSM (see Figure 3-5), and how they will communicate adverse findings to commanders and higher 
headquarters. 
FHP teams execute qualitative monitoring for all EPs regardless of their priority levels. Findings that relate to 
changing site conditions or more information clarifying exposures should be recorded in the EP detail form within 
DOEHRS-IH.  
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
10-2 
 
Note 
New information may be discovered that leads to need to change the priority level of 
an EP. 
The FHP team should have a plan for who validates new EP information and who makes the actual priority level 
change within the active CSM in DOEHRS-IH. It is recommended the lead Service’s OEHS Center is informed 
and/or consulted when the following actions are being considered:  
1. Changing the priority level 
2. Stop-dating an EP 
3. Creating a new EP in between recurring OEHSA surveys.  
Best practice guidance is available for how to approach these changes (see Appendix C). 
For moderate, high, or urgent priority EPs, OSEM may also include quantitative monitoring based on E-SAPs. 
The FHP team should use guidance from and coordinate with its specialized support assets, analytical 
laboratories, and/or their OEHS Center to establish how data generated during E-SAP execution and follow-on 
HRAs will be recorded and attached to the EP within DOEHRS-IH. As the data and assessments are developed, it 
is best to know ahead when and who will make updates to the EP documentation within DOEHRS-IH. 
Note 
Detailed EP documentation should follow CSM best practices (refer to Appendix C). 
During OSEM, all data and information updates for an EP should only occur in the 
active CSM area within DOEHRS-IH. The OEHSA CSM should not be used to 
perform OSEM tasks. 
10.4 DEVELOP ENHANCED SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS PLANS 
Development and execution of an E-SAP should be considered during the preceding OEHSA survey when the 
priority level of one or more CSM EPs is established as moderate, high, or urgent (refer to Figure 3-4 for 
definitions). Execution of this data generation plan will generate exposure monitoring data for follow-on HRA 
activities. 
Consideration should be given to whether an E-SAP and associated HRA should be conducted for the EP. The 
development and execution of an E-SAP for an EP requires appropriate resources but may not be needed to 
address the exposure concerns. A deliberate decision will need to be made as to whether to pursue such 
monitoring based on command risk management guidelines, available capabilities and resources, and support 
from specialized assets and/or the appropriate OEHS Center. The decision to pursue additional monitoring should 
generally be made by the FHP team in coordination with the location commander, higher echelon FHP assets, 
and/or the supporting OEHS Center.  
Note 
CCMD policy may override or alter such decision-making processes. 
Once the decision has been made to develop and execute an E-SAP for an EP, the FHP team should initiate the 
process by obtaining the most recent guidance and model SAP templates from its Service’s OEHS Center and the 
OEHSS support website: https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/oehss. 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
 
10-3 
JAN 2023 
Note 
Gathering all EP E-SAPs into one sitewide SAP is acceptable but may create an overly 
burdensome administrative task and, over time, may not allow sufficient, speedy 
adaptation to changing ground conditions; this may affect some EPs. 
As described in 4.4, the development of an E-SAP will typically involve the OEHS Center in support of the 
deployed team. The construction of an E-SAP requires more advanced skillsets than are typical for most deployed 
FHP teams. While execution of the field sampling elements of an E-SAP will typically be performed by a 
deployed FHP team, the full plan and the supporting laboratory analysis elements will require participation or 
oversight by theater laboratory assets and/or OEHS Center personnel. 
The process of developing a site-specific E-SAP will require the deployed FHP team’s attention for the following 
elements: 
1. Awareness of the EP’s health hazards in comparison to actual monitoring capabilities 
2. Review of organic exposure monitoring equipment and standing operating procedures 
3. Consideration of the need to potentially augment the equipment set with specialized capabilities 
4. Establishment of the strategy and timing for site sample collection or use of DRI capabilities 
5. Confirmation of sample management procedures with respect to supporting analytical laboratories 
6. Health and safety considerations for the sampling team during the sampling event(s). 
Once completed, an E-SAP should be uploaded as an attachment to the EP inside of the active CSM within 
DOEHRS-IH. 
10.5 PREPARE FOR ENHANCED HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS 
Enhanced HRA activities will generally follow execution of an E-SAP and data quality reviews of the generated 
data. In general, enhanced HRAs should be conducted by an experienced FHP team or the lead Service’s OEHS 
Center. Other than confirming lines of communication and sampling and analysis methods during E-SAP 
development, the key considerations for preparing for an enhanced HRA include the following: 
1. Who will conduct the HRA and who will receive the results? 
2. The types of quantitative data to be generated during E-SAP execution. 
3. Data quality assurance and control checks to be performed on generated data. 
4. Time periods covered by the sampling in relation to actual (or potential) exposure timeframes. 
5. The types of exposure estimates that can be generated and planned exposure guidelines (see 3.5). 
6. Expectations for the turn-around time of any analytical laboratory analyses and data results. 
7. Expectations for the turn-around time of the overall HRA. 
 
 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
10-4 
 
For EPs dealing with chemical health hazards, the HRA methodology for conducting an enhanced HRA will 
typically involve use of the MEGs and follow the guidance within Technical Guide 230. Additional exposure 
guidelines and HRA methodologies may be necessary depending upon the circumstances, health hazards under 
consideration, and guidance and/or consultative advice from the Service’s OEHS Center. 
For more context, refer to Chapter 3 for the general HRA framework used during OEHSS activities. 
Note 
Enhanced HRA methodologies for dealing with health hazards other than chemical 
substances are available on the OEHSS support website:

CHAPTER 11 
Execution of On-going Site Exposure 
Monitoring 
11.1 INTRODUCTION 
When OSEM preparation activities are completed, OSEM execution begins immediately (see Figure 1-3). 
Generally, after every recurring OEHSA survey is completed, the scope and magnitude of OSEM activities that 
will occur between each OEHSA survey should be reassessed. OSEM execution will sometimes involve both site 
visit and remote activities at supporting laboratories and the Service’s OEHS Center. 
Throughout all OSEM activities, deployed FHP teams should continuously communicate with their chain of 
command and supporting remote assets on the progress of site findings and potential health risks as they are 
identified and assessed. 
Note 
After the OEHSA survey, the priority level for each EP is further assessed on a 
recurring basis using information and data generated during OSEM. 
11.2 ON-GOING SITE EXPOSURE MONITORING SITE VISIT ACTIVITIES 
During OSEM execution, the deployed FHP team is responsible for the site visit activities listed below: 
1. Recurring site visits and communications with personnel stationed at the deployment location 
2. Site visit reconnaissance, facility inspections, EP validation and qualitative assessments 
3. E-SAP field execution activities for selected EPs during site visits 
4. OEH status briefings to the base camp commander/BOS-I 
5. Facilitating new or potential updates to the commander’s risk acceptance memoranda 
6. Associated updates to DOEHRS-IH documentation. 
Guidance for nearly all of these activities is the same as covered in Chapter 9 for executing an OEHSA survey. 
The main difference during OSEM is the nearly sole focus on the active CSM of EPs; however, the execution of 
E-SAPs for selected pathways also occurs. 
The frequency of recurring site visits to any given deployment location should be directed by CCMD FHP policy 
and may be tailored to the conditions at the location and priority levels of EPs within the CSM. For example, 
locations with multiple EPs set to high are likely to require more frequent site visits compared to locations with all 
EPs set to low. 
A major activity during OSEM is the recurring execution of E-SAP tasks that were developed during OSEM 
preparation (see 10.4). The execution of most SAPs will include challenges and unforeseen events. Therefore, the 
execution of an E-SAP should generally involve regular communication between the deployed FHP team 
performing on-site tasks and its support elements in-theater and at remote locations (e.g., the supporting OEHS 
Center). Dealing with contingencies and making adjustments to deal with sampling strategy hurdles and other 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
11-2 
 
difficulties is a major enabler for effective and successful E-SAP execution. All deviations from the written 
E-SAP should be communicated and documented along with the original E-SAP. The E-SAP documents should 
be uploaded to the EP inside the active CSM within DOEHRS-IH. Information and data generated during the 
execution of E-SAPs should be included as part of an enhanced HRA (refer to 11.5) and/or as part of an EP 
assessment documented within DOEHRS-IH (refer to Appendix C). 
11.3 ON-GOING SITE EXPOSURE MONITORING REMOTE ACTIVITIES 
During OSEM execution, the specialized assets, laboratories, and the OEHS Center supporting the deployed FHP 
team may be responsible for the remote activities listed below: 
1. E-SAP laboratory execution activities at in-theater or remote analytical laboratories 
2. E-SAP data quality assurance reviews 
3. E-HRA activities for the selected EPs 
4. Updates to the active CSM of EPs based on the aggregation of all relevant findings 
5. Development of risk mitigation recommendations, as needed 
6. Support for OEH status briefings to commanders, if requested by the deployed field team 
7. Associated updates to DOEHRS-IH documentation. 
Guidance for key activities is provided below. The specialized assets, laboratories, and the OEHS Center should 
be aware that the deployed FHP team may turn to them for assistance to deal with on-the-ground contingencies 
and other unforeseen events that might impact SAPs. 
11.4 DATA GENERATION AND QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS 
This manual does not address the specifics of the methods that in-theater or remote analytical laboratories use to 
generate data. However, laboratory-generated data should always be produced in support of a written site-specific 
SAP. After data has been generated and documented in DOEHRS-IH, data quality control checks should be 
performed prior to use within OEH assessments. Field sampling and laboratory analytical procedures and the 
results should undergo the qualitative and quantitative data evaluation and assessment to ensure generated data 
meets data quality standards defined within programmatic SAPs, or as documented in site-specific SAPs if 
deviation from programmatic standards was deemed necessary (see Chapter 4 and Appendix D). 
1. Data verification will consist of a review of field sampling and laboratory analytical records to determine 
that sampling and analytical procedures were carried out according to plan. 
2. Data validation will consist of a precision, accuracy (bias), representativeness, completeness and 
comparability (often referred to as the PARCC criteria) review of field and laboratory data to determine the 
extent to which variances in actual field or laboratory procedures or results may have affected data usability. 
Overarching standards for OEHSS activities should be defined within programmatic SAPs. 
3. Data assessment will consist of a review of all generated data for an EP to assess whether the data address 
the exposure concerns; likelihood that health hazards are present; likely environmental fate and transport 
pathways; and if EP scenarios are properly documented within the active CSM. Any deficiencies should be 
documented and considered during follow-on HRA activities.

JAN 2023 
11.5 ENHANCED HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS 
Enhanced HRA concepts are highlighted in Figures 3-1 and 3-6, and 10.5. In general, enhanced HRAs should be 
conducted by the OEHS Center or an experienced FHP team and based on an E-SAP (see 9.4) and any other 
supporting data deemed necessary. Enhanced HRAs should either include data quality reviews or follow such 
reviews (see 11.4). 
For EPs dealing with chemical health hazards, the HRA methodology for conducting an enhanced HRA will 
typically involve MEGs and follow Technical Guide 230. Additional exposure guidelines and HRA 
methodologies may be necessary depending upon the circumstances, health hazards under consideration, and 
consultative advice from the Service’s OEHS Center. 
Note 
Enhanced HRA methodologies for dealing with health hazards other than chemical 
substances are available on the OEHSS support website 
https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/oehss. 
At the conclusion of the risk assessment, sufficient information should be available to reassess the EP’s priority 
level and whether to collect additional data to support exposure monitoring and performance of additional HRAs 
over time. Appendix C provides best practice guidance for how to revise the priority level based on the results of 
the HRA. If the priority level changes, the OSEM plans for the EP may need to be altered to correspond to the 
health risk estimation results. Higher priority generally means more monitoring activity or risk mitigation actions. 
Once completed, an enhanced HRA should be uploaded to the EP as an EP assessment inside of the active CSM 
within DOEHRS-IH. Refer to Appendix C for best practice guidance on how to perform this action.

CHAPTER 12 
Periodic Occupational and Environmental 
Monitoring Summaries 
A POEMS is a retrospective summary document of the OEH exposure concerns and HRAs at a deployment 
location. The document compiles information from one to many years at specific locations. OEH clinical 
providers are the primary audience for POEMS. The following is the formal definition: 
POEMS. Unclassified and publicly releasable OEH monitoring summaries (e.g., noise, thermal stress, 
airborne pollutants, soil and water contaminants, incidents, and infectious diseases) that identify 
location-specific OEH hazards and population based health risks. POEMS provides estimated exposures, 
assessment of whether estimated exposures [were] acceptable or unacceptable, and the criteria used for 
the estimate (i.e., above or below Military Exposure Guidelines) along with anticipated acute, chronic, 
or latent health effects. POEMSs are updated or certified as current at least annually. 
DODI 6490.03 (JUN 2019), Deployment Health 
A POEMS should be considered for every major deployment location as soon as sufficient data are available. In 
general, a POEMS should reflect the results of the OEHSS process, information and data generated, and 
assessments performed over a year or more, in order to adequately evaluate potential health risks from long-term 
exposures that personnel experienced at a deployment location. 
As shown in Figure 1-3, the development of a POEMS for a deployment location is generally considered an 
activity that is performed after deployment because it is a retrospective assessment. For deployment locations that 
persist through longer periods of time, the process to prepare a POEMS will overlap with successive FHP team 
deployments. 
Per DHA-PI 6490.03, CCDRs specify which deployment locations require a POEMS document and all completed 
POEMSs are to be recorded in DOEHRS-IH, with any portion-marked classified content recorded in the MESL 
(using the SECRET Internet Protocol Router). Completion of the POEMS is the responsibility of the geographic 
CCDR who prioritizes and ensures POEMSs are completed by either developing them or requesting OEHS Center 
support to author and accomplish in accordance with CCMD written guidance. Appendix H provides POEMS 
template information.

CHAPTER 13 
Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record 
The ILER is an online application designed to create a complete record of every Service member’s OEH 
exposures over the course of the Service member’s career. It is a web-based application that provides DOD and 
VA the ability to link an individual to known exposure events to compile an exposure history to improve the 
efficiency and quality of health care. ILER provides DOD and VA clinicians, claims adjudicators, and benefits 
advisors actionable data required to improve care to Service members and veterans. The ILER is a relatively new 
capability and will eventually represent the complete and authoritative source for all OEHS data, including 
hazardous exposures to Service members in theater as well as to critical nontheater exposures that impact DOD 
and VA medical care and disabilities. The information, data, and assessments on CSM EPs that are compiled over 
time and documented within DOEHRS-IH will eventually be included in the ILER and made available for review 
by DOD and VA clinicians, claims adjudicators, and benefits advisors. 
Access to the ILER is restricted to specific users and is accessible at: https://iler.csd.disa.mil/iler/.

CHAPTER 14 
Assessment and Training 
14.1 ASSESSMENT 
Assessment measures the approach to and performance of OEHSS activities used to provide adequate FHP and 
inform future decisions. An assessment helps to answer the following questions: 
1. What happened? 
(Collection and Monitoring) 
2. Why? So what? 
(Analysis and Evaluation) 
3. What do we need to do? 
(Action for Improvement) 
Assessment is a continuous activity that begins in its design and continues through execution. It should include 
subordinates and mission partners and incorporate both quantitative and qualitative indicators. It is best practice to 
understand that human judgment is integral to assessment and often key to success. Assessment should balance a 
reliance on human judgment (qualitative) with direct observation and mathematical rigor (quantitative) to reduce 
the likelihood of skewed conclusions and decisions. A key best practice is to be careful of falling into the trap of 
assessing what you can versus what you should. 
1. Task assessment. Focuses on, Are we doing things right? It assesses performance of our tasks. Task 
assessment, much like after-action reviews and hot washes, helps review and improve techniques and 
procedures in how tasks are performed. 
2. Operational environment (OE) assessment. Focuses on, Are we doing the right things? It assesses how we 
are changing the OE, for better or worse. Within the context of OEHSS, OE assessment evaluates the 
accomplishment of the key tasks within the comprehensive OEHSS process in terms of speed, quality, and 
relevance. OE assessment informs prioritization, amending current plans—if off course—and future planning. 
3. Campaign assessment. Focuses on, Are we accomplishing the mission? It assesses progress in achieving 
objectives. Campaign assessments occur at higher echelon commands and simultaneously at the OEHS 
Centers. Within the context of OEHSS, this includes assessment of the actual protection of health and 
readiness of the force at each deployment location, and how exposures and assessments are properly 
documented in the DOEHRS-IH for future recall within POEMS documents and the ILER. Campaign 
assessment focuses on whether the operation is progressing as planned in terms of timelines or success 
criteria, and provides recommendations for addressing shortfalls or emerging challenges. 
A well-balanced assessment process (between qualitative and quantitative indicators) avoids excessive and 
time-consuming assessment schemes or quantitative collection efforts that squanders valuable resources and may 
be insufficient in informing the decision cycle. Avoid assessments performed at the speed of irrelevance or cost of 
other important activities. This is best accomplished with a continuous assessment cycle involving all staff and 
functional elements.

14.2 TRAINING GUIDELINES 
These MTTP describes standard procedures and establishes uniform operational concepts based on a common 
terminology. Lead Military Services and other pertinent organizations will adapt training with this MTTP for 
maximum FHP and combat effectiveness. A phased approach to training OEHSS activities can be an effective 
strategy for preparing FHP teams; however, the approach to each training event should be tailored to the situation 
and audience. The list below is an example of a phased approach:  
1. OEHSS training should initially focus upon the full framework components and fundamental concepts 
discussed within Chapters 1 through 6, and an overview of the entire manual. Brief highlights of relevant 
parts of DOEHRS-IH should be included. 
2. OEHSS training should focus upon how to engage with basing location Engineer Operations, understand 
the basics of deployment location design, and perform site visit related activities of the OEHSA survey in 
cooperation with Engineer Operations personnel, or independently. 
3. Training should focus upon CSMs and how to conceive and/or construct a set of valid EPs for a 
deployment location. How EPs are to be associated to elements of the OEHSA survey should be included, as 
well as how the CSM is to be maintained during OSEM activities over time. The CSM elements of 
DOEHRS-IH are also important to cover at this phase. 
4. Training should re-engage in HRA concepts and how important EPs will need to be assessed using HRA 
activities. HRA topics should include who performs them, how they are conducted, where they are 
documented in DOEHRS-IH, and how to communicate the results and recommendations. The training should 
also introduce the important concepts of data generation plans and the role of site-specific SAPs. 
5. Since the role of data generation and data quality plans would have been introduced in the previous topic 
(HRA Concepts), the next phase of training should focus on how to use the EP-specific model SAPs to create 
and execute site-specific SAPs. This will involve how to collaborate with OEHS Centers and possibly include 
refresher training related to exposure monitoring equipment and other capabilities. This part of training will 
necessarily be the most hands-on and field-relevant and should include field exercises and actual use of 
equipment and exercises of example site-specific SAPs. 
6. Topics related to measuring data quality and how that impacts use of data and long-term exposure records, 
should be an immediate follow-up to SAP-related training. 
7. Teams should be trained on how to complete the OEHSA survey within DOEHRS-IH, initiate the survey 
review process, and get the survey approved and finalized. 
8. FHP teams can also learn how to evaluate the OEH status of a deployment location, with or without use of 
an OEH status checklist; develop risk mitigation options; and create and give a status briefing to commanders. 
9. Training for experienced FHP personnel should also include use of emerging technologies and capabilities 
and how to handle unique CSM EP problems.

Site Assessment Survey 
The OEHSA survey provides a comprehensive overview of both occupational and EH threats associated with a 
deployment location and the activities and missions that occur there. Figure B-1 defines the 21 sections of the 
OEHSA template. The OEHSA survey template is the data/information collection tool used to describe site 
conditions and identify OEH threats in order to build a comprehensive CSM for a particular deployed location. 
The OEHSA survey should be recorded directly into the EH module of DOEHRS-IH. A template is available at

APPENDIX C 
Conceptual Site Model Best Practices 
The creation of a CSM of EPs should proceed according to a set of best practices developed and maintained by 
the OEHS Centers. Technical Guide 392, Conceptual Site Model Best Practices and Exposure Pathway Guidance, 
provides current best practices and is available on the OEHSS support website: 
https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/oehss. 
The CSM best practices for EPs include the following (details are provided in the technical guide): 
Preliminary CSM: 
1. The creation of a preliminary CSM is an activity best suited for planning the first site visit to a new 
location. Preliminary CSMs do not need to be created within DOEHRS-IH. 
EP Creation (within DOEHRS-IH): 
2. Within DOEHRS-IH, create, revise, and update EPs within the active CSM area of the EH module. 
Associate those pathways with specific sections of the OEHSA survey after they have been created, revised, 
or updated in the active CSM. All pathways linked to the OEHSA survey are viewable in the OEHSA CSM. 
Refer to Figure C-1 for how to locate these two different CSMs within DOEHRS-IH. 
3. When a deployment location has an active IH or occupational radiation safety program, EPs should not be 
created within the EH module of DOEHRS-IH for the specific workplaces under the management of those 
programs. 
4. The creation, and subsequent management, of EPs over time is a collaborative effort involving 
boots-on-the-ground FHP teams, their higher echelon FHP officers, and SMEs at the reachback OEHS 
Centers. 
5. Use standard EPs for a given deployment location. Name each EP using the naming conventions in the 
CSM best practices technical guide. Unique situations can be addressed with nonstandard pathways. 
6. Use the CSM best practices technical guide to determine which EPs are required for a location and how to 
document the details of each EP within the EH module of DOEHRS-IH. 
7. Each EP requires the selection of a priority level. The CSM best practices technical guide provides 
instructions for determining the initial priority level at the time an EP is created. It also provides instructions 
for potential revisions of the priority level based on the collection and evaluation of additional data and 
information (see step 10). 
8. In the rare situation when there is a desire to assign specific individuals to an EP, consult the CSM best 
practices technical guide. 
EP Management: 
9. Ensure the EPs found in the active CSM at any given time reflect the health hazard exposure conditions at 
the location. Add new pathways as required, modify existing pathways as new information is generated, 
record risk management decisions and actions taken within the pathway details, and stop-date those pathways 
that are no longer complete.

10. After EP HRAs, or other kinds of EP assessments, are completed, validate or revise EP priority level 
using the CSM best practices technical guide. 
11. Document EP HRAs, and other kinds of EP assessments, within the EP using the EP assessment feature 
in the EH module of DOEHRS-IH.

General Sampling and Analysis Plan 
Guidance 
D.1 INTRODUCTION 
This appendix provides general guidance for SAPs. Refer to Chapter 4 for a description of the OEHSS framework 
for SAPs. Data generation and exposure monitoring during OEHSS should proceed according to defined, written 
SAPs that address sampling strategies, sample management, laboratory analyses, and associated quality 
assurance. Basic guidance is provided by current data generation planning manuals prepared by the Service OEHS 
Centers (e.g., Technical Guide 317, Technical Guide for the Collection of Environmental Sampling Data Related 
to Environmental Health Site Assessments for Military Deployments; Technical Manual-Preventive Medicine 
6490.2, Technical Guide for Collection of Environmental Sampling Data Related to Environmental Health Site 
Assessments for Military Deployments; and U.S. Air Force 2019 Bioenvironmental Engineering Field Manual, 
U.S. Air Force Medical Readiness Agency (AFMRA)). However, there have been significant OEHSS lessons 
learned and recent advances in professional best practices for EH data generation and quality assurance that the 
OEHS Centers can translate into programmatic and site-specific approaches for OEHSS activities. Deployed FHP 
field teams should coordinate with their Service OEHS Center to obtain current, operationally practical SAP 
guidance and templates. 
Available programmatic plans and model SAP templates and other guidance can be found at the OEHSS support 
website: https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/oehss. 
D.2 GENERAL GUIDANCE 
The primary objective of OEHSS data generation is to estimate exposure levels and characterize health risks 
associated with OEH threat sources and their health hazards. The right type, quantity, and quality of data over 
time required to support these objectives throughout the OEHSS process should be defined within programmatic 
plans and site-specific SAPs. Data generation activities are best employed in a two-phased approach, whereby the 
first phase is to screen for potential exposures of concern and the second phase is to further characterize those 
exposures and associated health risks. These two phases are embedded within the OEHSS. 
The consequences of inadequate planning for EH investigations have been summarized by the ITRC: 
Many in the environmental community have recognized the need for systematic project planning as 
reflected in the [Environmental Protection Agency’s] DQO process, the USACE TPP Guidance (USACE 
1998), and others. Too often during the course of performing environmental investigations, insufficient 
attention is directed to establishing clear objectives for the work, sometimes leading to unproductive 
investigations that fail to efficiently gather the information necessary for scientifically defensible 
decisions.

Data generation for OEHSS activities should be based on a systematic planning process that blends available best 
practice guidance with a heavy emphasis on use of the DQO process (see Figure D-1) in order to provide the 
structure for articulating the numerous planning factors involved with executing worldwide data collection efforts. 
The DQO process is one of a number of best practice techniques that guides the resource-effective acquisition of 
EH data. In its DQO guidance manual, the EPA stated: 
The DQO Process is a series of logical steps that guides managers or staff to a plan for the 
resource-effective acquisition of environmental data. It is both flexible and iterative, and applies to both 
decision-making (e.g., compliance/noncompliance with a standard) and estimation (e.g., ascertaining the 
mean concentration level of a contaminant). The DQO Process is used to establish performance and 
acceptance criteria, which serve as the basis for designing a plan for collecting data of sufficient quality 
and quantity to support the goals of the study. Use of the DQO Process leads to efficient and effective 
expenditure of resources; consensus on the type, quality, and quantity of data needed to meet the project 
goal; and the full documentation of actions taken during the development of the project.

In its guidance on use of the triad approach for environmental project management, the ITRC emphasized that 
systematic planning revolves around one central concept: understanding and managing uncertainty. It further 
stated that: 
Environmental investigations are truly multidisciplinary endeavors, and this fact creates a management 
challenge. The project team must avoid a loss of focus on the specific investigation objectives while 
integrating different technical viewpoints. This goal is accomplished by achieving consensus on the 
investigation objectives prior to beginning generation of planning documents that support field work. 
This vital step of systematic planning is central to a successful investigation. 
Interstate Technology & Regulatory Council, 2003 
The above best practices are recommended. Successful sampling investigations must begin with a shared 
understanding of the purpose and use of the generated data and planning for the investigation should focus on 
understanding and managing uncertainty. Figures D-2 (adopted and slightly modified from the EPA DQO 
guidance (EPA 2006)) and D-3 (see EPA’s Guidance on Systematic Planning Using the Data Quality Objectives 
Process) provide insight to the kinds of considerations that need to be addressed while developing plans.

In a probability-based sampling design, each possible sampling unit has a known probability of being selected, 
and only those sampling units selected will provide data for the study. 
In a judgmental sampling design, the sampling units are not assigned a known probability of being selected, but 
rather, are selected at the discretion of the person in charge of the sampling effort. 
These two types of sampling designs have considerably different types of inference that can be drawn from the 
sample data. 
Statistical inference techniques (e.g., hypothesis tests, confidence intervals) require a probability-based 
sampling design, as this type of design will allow you to properly characterize uncertainty in the outcome of the 
data collection process. Because the DQO process is centered on properly dealing with uncertainty in your 
data, such designs are highly recommended as part of this process. Examples of common probability-based 
sampling approaches include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and systematic and grid sampling. 
Probability-based sampling allows you to draw quantitative conclusions about the target population, while also 
properly expressing uncertainty in these conclusions through calculating confidence intervals, controlling for 
decision error probabilities, etc. 
Judgmental sampling involves the selection of sampling units on the basis of expert knowledge or professional 
judgment. Emphasizing historical and physical knowledge of the underlying site condition and sampling units 
over the need to implement potentially complex statistical sampling theory make judgmental sampling an 
appealing option for some applications. However, judgmental sampling designs will not allow you to 
characterize uncertainty properly. As a result, the outcome of statistical analysis on data collected through 
judgmental sampling cannot be used to make any type of scientifically defensible probabilistic statements about 
the target population. Conclusions are made solely on the basis of scientific judgment, and therefore, depend 
entirely on the validity and accuracy of this judgment.

APPENDIX E 
Exposure Incident Guidance and Reports 
E.1 GUIDANCE FOR EXPOSURE INCIDENT REPORT DETERMINATION AND ACTIONS 
Exposure incidents and reports are not generally part of regular site surveillance exposure monitoring. They only 
apply when unusual exposure situations occur. OH exposure guidelines should be relied upon to assess OH 
exposure incidents, and EH exposure guidelines to assess EH exposure incidents. The following guidance can 
assist in the determination of whether an exposure incident report should be triggered by one or more of the 
criteria published in the DHA-PI 6490.03. 
E.1.1 Exposure Incident Report Criterion 1: Visual/Sensory Cues 
DHA-PI 6490.03 Criterion: Visual/sensory cues are, or were, present indicating potential presence of an OEH 
hazard (e.g., smoke/cloud, odors, strange liquid/powders, etc.). 
1. Relevant health hazards. Chemicals, radionuclides, and microbiological organisms or toxins. 
2. When triggered. The criterion is triggered if an initial field account survey (IFAS) was prepared, or by 
professional judgment, when an FHP team learns about the event and determines the cues are indicative of a 
situation creating an unknown hazard of concern or a known hazard to which personnel may have been 
exposed in an unusual way. Exposure could have occurred, or is occurring, if all six elements of an EP are 
satisfied (refer to 3.3.2). 
3. When not triggered: The criterion is not triggered if exposure did not occur because one of the six pathway 
elements was not satisfied or the situation can be quickly explained as nonhazardous by the FHP team. 
4. FHP actions: The determination should be documented by the FHP team in the EP within DOEHRS-IH. If 
the criterion is triggered and exposure is on-going after the incident, EP should be prioritized as urgent and an 
incident investigation and report (incident report survey (IRS)) is required. Environmental sampling and 
analysis may need to be performed.  
Note 
If triggered solely by an IFAS, the incident may not be associated with an existing EP. 
E.1.2 Exposure Incident Report Criterion 2: Real-time Detection 
DHA-PI 6490.03 Criterion: The presence of an acute OEH hazard is indicated through positive detection using 
real-time field equipment (e.g., direct reading instruments, joint chemical agent detector, improved chemical agent 
monitor, M8 chemical detector paper, or M256 chemical agent detector kit). 
1. Relevant health hazards: Chemicals, radionuclides, and microbiological organisms or toxins. 
2. When triggered: The criterion is triggered if an IFAS was prepared, or by professional judgment when an 
FHP team, or CBRN team, generates a valid and reliable presumptive hazard detection using real-time field 
equipment that indicates exposures in an area used by personnel might be higher than what would be 
considered low risk. For non-CBRN chemicals in air, this would generally not occur unless a concentration 
was detected higher than the appropriate short-term marginal MEG or equivalent guideline. 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
E-2 
 
3. When not triggered: The criterion is not triggered if the detection is low enough (as defined above), or 
exposure is not, or did not, occur because one of the six pathway elements was not satisfied (refer to 3.3.2 for 
these elements). 
4. FHP actions: If the criterion is triggered, the determination should be documented in the EP within 
DOEHRS-IH, the EP should be prioritized as urgent and an incident investigation and report is required. 
Additional environmental sampling and analysis may need to be performed using field confirmatory, theater 
validation, and/or definitive analysis. 
E.1.3 Exposure Incident Criterion 3: Data Evaluation 
DHA-PI 6490.03 Criterion: Evaluation of data by an appropriate medical/health professional indicates that 
exposure could plausibly result in some significant adverse health outcome, either short- or long-term. 
1. Relevant health hazards: Any type of health hazard. 
2. When triggered: The criterion is triggered by professional judgment of an appropriate medical or health 
professional during the course of the performance or review of an HRA generated during OEHSS process. 
This would only occur when an HRA concludes that the risk was high or extremely high. 
3. When not triggered: The criterion is not triggered when an HRA concludes that the risk was low or 
moderate. 
4. FHP actions: If the criterion is triggered, the determination should be included in the HRA report and 
documented as part of the EP assessment. The EP should be prioritized as urgent until an incident 
investigation and report is completed. Additional environmental sampling and analysis may need to be 
performed using field confirmatory, theater validation, and/or definitive analysis. 
E.1.4 Exposure Incident Criterion 4: Significant Exposure Occurrence 
DHA-PI 6490.03 Criterion: Incident results in a significant exposure to any deployed individual(s), including 
from CBRN agents and acutely toxic industrial chemicals. 
1. Relevant health hazards: CBRN agents and acutely toxic industrial chemicals. 
2. When triggered: The criterion is triggered by one or more of the conditions that would trigger criteria 
numbers 1 (visual/sensory cues), 2 (real-time detection), and/or 3 (data evaluation). 
3. When not triggered: The criterion is not triggered in the same way as criteria numbers 1, 2, and/or 3. 
4. FHP actions: The actions should match those described for criteria numbers 1, 2, and/or 3 for the situation 
applicable to the significant exposure occurrence.  
E.1.5 Exposure Incident Criterion 5: Observed Acute Clinical Outcomes 
DHA-PI 6490.03 Criterion: The presence of a health hazard is plausibly associated with actual observed (acute) 
clinical health outcomes that are reported and/or treated (e.g., complaints of headaches, dizziness, skin or eye 
irritation/burning, coughing, nausea, etc.). 
1. Relevant health hazards: Any type of health hazard. 
2. When triggered: The criterion is potentially triggered by professional judgment of an appropriate medical 
professional during the course of a clinical encounter at the deployment location, or elsewhere in-theater. If 
this is the case, the expectation is that the medical professional will contact the supporting FHP assets 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
 
E-3 
JAN 2023 
in-theater to collectively evaluate whether the reported health effects are plausibly associated with an incident. 
If agreed, an incident investigation is triggered. 
3. When not triggered: The criterion is not triggered when the professional judgment of an appropriate 
medical professional is that an OEH exposure is not plausibly linked to the outcome(s). 
4. FHP actions: If the criterion is triggered, then the supporting FHP assets in-theater will begin an incident 
investigation and report. The incident may or may not be associated with an existing EP, and the cause of the 
acute effects in the personnel may not be initially known. 
E.1.6 Exposure Incident Criterion 6: Leadership Concern 
DHA-PI 6490.03 Criterion: Concern over a perceived or potential adverse health exposure leads to involvement 
of (PVNTMED [Operational Public Health]) assets and military leadership for investigation, assessment, 
determination and response. Document these actions as an incident report even when there is a determination that 
no adverse exposures or impacts to human health are expected. 
1. Relevant health hazards: Any type of health hazard. 
2. When triggered: The criterion is triggered by military leadership and the chain of command but not 
directly by findings from OEHSS activities. 
3. When not triggered: The criterion is not triggered until a commander requires an investigation. 
4. FHP actions: If the criterion is triggered, the expectation is that an FHP team will be ordered to begin an 
incident investigation and report. The incident may or may not be associated with an existing EP. 
E.2 EXPOSURE INCIDENT REPORTS 
The Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure Incident Report actually consists of two forms or sets of 
reported information, as described below: 
1. IFAS. A documentation of the on-site field information regarding the OEH hazard, detection results, 
exposures, symptoms, visual and witness information, and other details. This form is especially critical and 
will typically need to involve the units that were part of the incident and the FHP team involved in collection 
of any samples and reporting. There may be multiple units completing separate IFASs. 
2. IRS. A postincident overall health assessment that consolidates the incident information pertaining to 
personnel exposures, any associated health effects, and an HRA summary of the incident. Completion of the 
IRS ensures that the necessary information is consolidated and submitted to the designated DOD data archive. 
The IFAS and IRS forms are available in the Incident Reporting module of DOEHRS-IH and on the OEHSS 
support website. Use of this module allows for real-time data archiving; however, typically only 
PVNTMED/public health assets will have access to this system. If completed as hardcopy only, these forms must 
be submitted and stored in the MESL (refer to Chapter 6) or Service-specific data collection system. 
Note 
OEH exposure incident reports are the same as those used to document 
CBRN-exposure incidents, see: 
ATP 4-02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3. 
NTRP 4-02.9M/AFTTP 3-2.82/ATP 4-02.82 
JAN 2023 
E-4 
 
E.2.1 Guidance for the Initial Field Account Survey 
Typically, the units that are part of the incident would complete the IFAS along with the chain of command 
involved in the incident. The IFAS should be completed as thoroughly as possible and submitted to the command 
surgeon or PVNTMED/public health officer within 24 hours of an incident. 
Note 
If an IFAS was not prepared for an incident by the unit(s) involved, the FHP team that 
investigates the incident and prepares the IRS (next subsection) does not need to create 
an IFAS. 
Details in the IFAS and underlying reports, such as significant activity (SIGACT) reports and roster may be 
classified. Unit security personnel must review the IFAS and determine the classification it should have. Since 
standard SIGACT reports typically do not include all the required information for CBRN/OEH-exposure 
incidents, ensure the IFAS is filled out to expand the information that may have been put in the SIGACT report. If 
a SIGACT report already contains all the required information, a separate IFAS is not required and the SIGACT 
report may be uploaded into DOEHRS-IH; otherwise, the IFAS should be completed by the units involved and 
reference the SIGACT number. 
By completing the IFAS, the involved units can facilitate the assessment of exposure incident and appropriate 
medical surveillance follow-up. In addition, the information can provide valuable lessons learned that could help 
mitigate future similar events. 
E.2.2 Guidance for the Incident Report Survey 
The FHP team and/or one of the OEHS Centers will complete the IRS. The command surgeon/medical officer 
designates who will prepare the IRS. Ideally, the IRS is prepared as an unclassified document so personnel and 
providers can have access. While details in some of the underlying documents and reports (e.g., SIGACT, IFAS, 
and roster) may be classified; to the extent possible, the IRS report itself should be completed at the lowest 
classification possible for the widest distribution. 
Most elements of the IRS are straightforward and/or should be contained in other documents. Information such as 
SIGACT, IFAS, rosters, field and/or analytical data, and risk communication documents, may be used and 
referenced as attachments to the form. Additionally, an overall summary of the incident will need to be 
constructed and the various lines of evidence interpreted to provide an overall assessment of the incident. 
An exposure incident HRA may be needed to assist in the full investigation of the incident, which should include 
risk estimates for acute health effects and the potential for long-term health effects. These risk assessments should 
be conducted by experienced FHP team members and/or SMEs at one or more of the OEHS Centers (see 1.3). If it 
is determined that a significant exposure did occur or was likely to have occurred, the possible health effects 
should be described and any relevant medical information included for future reference by those who will conduct 
follow-on medical surveillance. 
Depending on the incident and/or conclusions of any risk assessment, risk communication products (for example, 
fact sheets and briefings) may need to be prepared. 
The IRS should include reference to the roster that indicates those persons medically treated and their disposition, 
and provide any rapid medical evaluation reports and any Standard Form 600 (Chronological Record of Medical 
Care) overlays. 
When completed outside of the Incident Reporting module of DOEHRS-IH, the IRS and all associated 
attachments and documents should be submitted to the combined JTF surgeon/FHP officer who is ultimately 
responsible for final determination and submittal to the DOEHRS-IH Document Library (or MESL for classified 
documentation [refer to Chapter 6]) or Service-specific data collection system.

Site Surveillance Status Templates 
The OEHSS status briefing (or OEH status briefing) is an FHP team briefing to the base camp commander/BOS-I 
that communicates the top OEH priorities for a basing location. Briefings are typically performed at the end of 
each site visit. The OEH status briefing can be supported by a status checklist, which can be used by FHP 
personnel who perform OEHSS activities and sanitary inspections to summarize findings and recurring 
reassessments over time. Figure F-1 defines the sections of the standard OEH status briefing template. The full

or positive change in environmental conditions at a base camp site. It amends the EBS and can help address 
environmental damage claims or other legal challenges that may arise during the life cycle of the base camp. 
(ATP 3-34.5/MCRP 4-11B) 
environmental health. The programs, activities, and subsequent risk determination associated with the 
anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and potential control of hazards identified within the media of the 
environment. Environmental health focuses on the reduction or mitigation of the health hazards identified in 
the operational or garrison environment. (DODD 6420.02) 
exposure estimate. Measurements or predictions of the level of exposure to a given health hazard. These 
estimates can be qualitative, but are traditionally considered to be numerical, quantitative estimates.  
exposure guideline. Hazard-specific exposure levels that are associated with a given level of health risk. 
Exposure guidelines can be categorized into tiers relative to their importance or stature. For example, such 
guidelines can be referred to as criteria, standards, or guidelines. The terminology difference can be important. 
Criteria generally carry legal weight, standards are generally regulatory in nature, and guidelines tend to serve 
as consensus risk assessment recommendations.

exposure medium. As an element of an exposure pathway, an exposure medium is the part of the physical 
environment containing a health hazards with which humans come into contact. Examples include water, soil, 
air, surfaces, and biological fluids.  
exposure pathway. A description of how exposure occurs from health hazard release from a source into the 
environment, transport through environment and within one or more environmental media (air, water, soil, 
surfaces, etc.), the routes of human exposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, etc.), and where and 
when specific personnel come into contact with the hazard (e.g. a specific cohort exposed at the same time or 
in a similar way as compared). There are six components of an exposure pathway that each must be present in 
order for an actual exposure to occur: (1) source, (2) health hazard, (3) exposure point, (4) exposure medium, 
(5) route of exposure, and (6) co-occurrence in time with a population-at-risk.  
exposure point. As an element of an exposure pathway, an exposure point is the geospatial location or where a 
population-at-risk comes into contact with an exposure medium containing a health hazard.  
field confirmatory analysis. The employment of technologies with increased specificity and sensitivity by 
technical forces in a field environment to identify chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazards 
with a moderate level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support follow-on tactical and 
operational decisions. (ATP 3-11.37/MCRP 10-10E.7/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44). 
health hazard. As an element of an exposure pathway, a health hazard is a chemical or radiological substance, 
microbiological organism or toxin, or physical condition (e.g., heat, noise) that has the potential to cause 
adverse health effects within the human body.  
health risk assessment. A scientific/analytic process used to estimate risk by synthesizing available 
information to identify sources of OEH threats at a site, identify the health hazards associated with each threat 
source, identify populations at risk, guide data collection requirements and plans, describe the magnitude and 
timing of population exposures, describe the kinds of health effects caused by the exposure, and characterize 
the risk information in order to effectively communicate to commanders and stakeholders.  
model sampling and analysis plan. A template document (with limited and targeted guidance embedded 
within it) for generating a site-specific sampling and analysis plan that defines the OEH problem requiring 
sampling data that addresses data quality objectives, sampling strategies, sample management, laboratory 
analyses, and associated quality assurance.  
occupational and environmental health surveillance (OEHS). The regular or repeated collection, 
analysis, archiving, interpretation, and dissemination of occupational and environmental health-related data for 
monitoring the health of, or potential health hazard impact on, a population and individual personnel, and for 
intervening in a timely manner to prevent, treat, or control the occurrence of disease or injury when determined 
necessary. (DOD Directive 6490.02E) 
occupational and environmental health site assessment (OEHSA). A FHP survey that formally 
documents the OEH conditions at a basing location. These surveys are typically updated annually and/or with 
the rotations of deployed FHP teams into and out of the Area of Operations.  
occupational and environmental health site surveillance (OEHSS). OEH surveillance focused upon 
health hazards and exposures at a specific military basing site in the operational environment (e.g., base camp, 
airbase, forward operating base (FOB)). It structures and facilitates exposure monitoring, health risk 
assessment, and risk management activities at these sites. The OEHSS process is iterative and educates FHP 
personnel about site environmental conditions, documents those conditions, identifies potential OEH threats 
and associated specific health hazards, includes OEH data collection and archiving activities and health risk 
assessments, and documents immediate risk mitigation actions.

on-going site exposure monitoring. The collection of OEH monitoring and assessment activities performed 
for a basing location that includes regular site visits, conceptual site model adjustments, sampling and analysis 
plans, field sampling, sample shipment, laboratory analyses, health risk assessments, and associated 
documentation. OSEM activities occur in between each recurring OEHSA survey and includes OEH status 
briefings.  
periodic occupational and environmental monitoring summary. Unclassified and publicly-releasable 
OEH monitoring summaries (e.g., noise, thermal stress, airborne pollutants, soil and water contaminants, 
incidents, and infectious diseases) that identify location specific OEH hazards and population-based health 
risks. POEMS provide estimated exposures, assessment of whether estimated exposures [were] acceptable or 
unacceptable, and the criteria used for the estimate (i.e., above or below Military Exposure Guidelines) along 
with anticipated acute, chronic, or latent health effects. POEMSs are updated or certified current at least 
annually. (DODI 6490.03) 
population-at-risk. As an element of an exposure pathway, this is a group of individuals who are or may be 
exposed to a health hazard via one or more routes of exposure.  
preliminary hazard assessment. A CCMD document that summarizes their review of relevant intelligence 
data, past hazard assessments, and all other available information for a new deployment location for the 
purpose of early identification of potential OEH threats and risk management countermeasures prior to 
deploying to a newly established location.  
route of exposure. As an element of an exposure pathway, an exposure route is the mode by which a health 
hazard enters or interacts with the human body. Example routes of exposure include, but are not limited to, 
inhalation of air; ingestion of water or soil; skin contact with water, soil, or air; ocular (eye) contact; puncture 
wound; physical entry (as for radiation or noise).  
sampling and analysis plan. A plan that defines the OEH problem requiring sampling data that addresses 
data quality objectives, sampling strategies, sample management, laboratory analyses, and associated quality 
assurance.  
source. As an element of an exposure pathway, a source is the origin of a health hazard that is released into the 
environment. Often referred to as a threat source. Example sources include a field of buried drums, burn pit, 
bulk chemical storage, incinerator, radio-frequency emitters, fugitive emission from off-site industries, on-site 
sanding/painting operations, and a transportation route.  
theater validation analysis. The employment of multiple independent, established protocols and technologies 
by scientific experts in the controlled environment of a fixed or mobile/transportable laboratory to characterize 
a chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with a high level of confidence and the degree of 
certainty necessary to support operational to strategic-level decisions.
