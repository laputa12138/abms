Chapter I 
DIVE CAPABILITIES IN JOINT OPERATIONS 
1. Diving in Joint Operations
In the United States (US) military, dive capabilities are maintained as specialized skill 
sets to facilitate accomplishing a unit’s assigned missions. Diving does not have to be a 
stand-alone mission, rather it can be incorporated in joint activities across the 
competition continuum to enhance military success. Additionally, integrating diving 
operations into the three major types of operations, offensive, defensive, and stability 
can enable or enhance tactical success. The following examples show how diving can 
be integrated. 
a. Offensive. These operations are conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces
and seize terrain, resources, and population centers. Divers can be employed to
infiltrate enemy areas, install devices on land that will disable enemy key
infrastructure, and aid follow-on forces.
b. Defensive. These operations are conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time,
economize forces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive and stability tasks.
Divers can be rapidly deployed in response to national security concerns and assist
in placing and maintaining physical security systems in critical areas, such as ports,
bridges, and dams.
c. Stability. Diving operations can include salvage (for repair), logistical support, and
search and recovery. Salvage (for repair) is conducted to recover or restore assets
or equipment which has been submerged in depths of water. Diving provides
logistical support for global force or civilian infrastructure sustainment, especially
after a disaster. Also, search and recovery diving is conducted to recover personnel
to the joint force component commanders.
2. Dive Missions in Support of Joint Activities
The use of diving in support of joint activities has steadily increased since the inception 
of military divers; however, the benefit of using diving assets is not generally understood 
at the tactical level. To help showcase diving across joint activities (which range from 
shaping to enabling in Joint Publication (JP), 3-0, Joint Campaigns and Operations), 
some diving vignettes are highlighted on subsequent pages. To best understand how 
diving is related to each joint activity, a brief explanation precedes each vignette and 
figure 1 explains a notional joint combat operation model from JP 3-0.

a. Shaping Activities. Shaping activities include long-term persistent and preventive
military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence actions to assure friends,
build partner capacity and capability, and promote regional stability. One example of
using diving assets for this purpose is exemplified in the following vignette, when the
US Navy assisted the Philippine Navy in 2001.

COOPERATION AFLOAT READINESS AND TRAINING 2001, 
SHAPING ACTIVITIES 
While deployed on a combined readiness and training exercise in 2001, United 
States (US) military divers trained the Philippine diving and explosive ordnance 
disposal (EOD) forces on basic salvage and demolition core skills. The Philippine 
Navy requested help in identification and disposal of ordnance found on WWII 
sunken US ships in Subic Bay, Philippines. Additionally, the Philippine Navy 
requested assistance in salvage and disposal of the same ships. US Navy EOD 
divers identified and provided training and guidance for safe ordnance disposal 
while multi-Service divers, simultaneously, trained and assisted in salvage of the 
same sunk US ships. This greatly enabled the Philippine Navy in clearing these 
harbor obstructions and provided a safer environment for the host country, as 
well as building partnership capability and honing strategic and regional 
relationships.

b. Deterrence Activities. Diving operations can provide options to deter enemy
forces. According to JP 3-0, once a crisis is defined, deterrence actions may include
mobilization, tailoring forces, and other predeployment activities. Predeployment
activities may include initial deployment into a theater; employing intelligence
collection assets; and developing mission-tailored command and control,
intelligence, force protection, and logistic requirements to support contingency
operations. The following vignette showcases using diving assets to emplace
underwater countermobility measures, such as emplacing obstacles and mines.
WORLD WAR II, DETERRENCE 
In March of 1945, Navy Underwater Demolition Teams 7, 11, 12,13,14, 16, and 
17 conducted a series of military dive operations in Okinawa [Japan] to clear 
potential beach landing sites for Marine assault forces, as well as conduct feints 
to create the illusion of landing sites in other locations. This was the largest 
single diving operation of World War II. These operations consisted of mobility 
and countermobility dive missions that emplaced obstacles in areas assumed to 
be used as avenues of approach by Japanese forces, and reduced and removed 
obstacles in sites chosen for Marine beach landing sites. These missions were 
conducted to deter Japanese forces from focusing their attention and forces on 
the actual beach landing sites used by Marine landing forces. These dive 
missions facilitated Marine forces landing and ensured the successful invasion 
and seizure of the island of Okinawa. Furthermore, this type of diving asset use 
can provide an option to use underwater security detection and monitoring 
devices, which not only enable a commander to gain insight for potential future 
plans, but also work as flexible deterrent options for enemy forces. 
SOURCE: United States Marine Corps, March 1945 
c. Seize Initiative Activities. Commanders seek to seize the initiative by using
decisive joint force capabilities. In combat, this involves starting defensive and
offensive operations at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate

offensively and setting the conditions for decisive operations. Applying joint combat 
power rapidly may be required to delay, impede, or halt the enemy’s initial 
aggression and deny the enemy’s initial objectives. Operations to gain access to 
theater infrastructure and expand friendly freedom of action continue during this 
phase, while the commander seeks to degrade enemy capabilities with the intent of 
resolving the crisis at the earliest opportunity. Diving operations during this activity 
are often not immediately considered but divers can execute missions well and 
provide a commander with the tactical surprise to control the battlefield. The 
following vignette highlights these endeavors. 
OPERATION LIGHTS OUT, SEIZING THE INITIATIVE 
At approximately 0200, special operations forces divers conducted a clandestine 
infiltration and emplaced demolitions on strategic infrastructure and a key main 
supply route bridge to deny the enemy’s ability to quickly reinforce and sustain 
themselves. Upon H-hour, the enemy’s sudden and total loss of power, water, 
and communications, disrupted the ability to react and enabled the follow-on 
ground and air assaults by United States (US) Special Operations Command 
land forces. Near simultaneously, previously infiltrated elements led indigenous 
forces to capture and control strategic airfields and ports. Conventional ground 
forces deployed through these seized entry points and achieved their strategic 
objectives. The use of diving assets over conventional methods to accomplish 
these objectives greatly reduced visibility and the risk of US detection. This 
enabled tactical surprise and provided minimal collateral damage. This operation 
caused scalable damage to infrastructure, which allowed for ease of repair and 
minimized risk to follow-on, conventional ground and air forces.

d. Dominate Activities. Diving operations can be used to break an enemy’s will to
resist. When used with other activities, diving can assist forces with the ability to
dominate in a joint operation. A commander can employ diving assets for offensive
operations (such as mobility, infiltration and exfiltration, and using explosives).
Reducing obstacles increases mobility which will allow forces to dominate. Additional
operations, which include countermobility, physical protection and using explosives,
capitalize on the friendly’s momentum and initiative. Some of these activities include
demolishing bridge structures, facilities, and infrastructure, which ultimately impede
an enemy’s ability to maneuver.
e. Stabilize and Enable Activities. During stabilizing and enabling activities of a joint
operation, diving assets can be invaluable in reestablishing a safe and secure
environment, providing essential government services, emergency infrastructure
reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. Through diving support to the host
government, the host nation’s civil authority can regain its ability to administer the
services and needs of the population. Diving assets were critical to accomplish this,
as highlighted in the vignette discussing the US assistance after the Haiti earthquake
in 2010. This operation also exemplifies one of the first successful US joint diving
operations.

OPERATION UNIFIED RESPONSE, STABILIZING AND ENABLING 
On 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti. The 544th 
Engineer Dive Team was deployed on the United States Naval Ship Grasp (T-
ARS-51) on a mission to train the Belizean Navy in diving techniques in support 
of US Southern Command. Immediately after the earthquake, the 544th was 
redirected from Belize to Haiti to participate in disaster relief efforts. 
A US Air Force special tactics squadron was also deployed. Its mission was 
to secure the airfield and coordinate air traffic to facilitate inbound relief efforts 
and additional personnel. Pararescue teams provided emergency services and 
waterborne rescue capabilities to the commander. 
Upon arrival in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the 544th immediately began 
assessments of three different ports and waterfront facilities to determine 
feasibility for disaster relief usage. The hasty inspections determined that the port 
structures in Port-au-Prince were so severely damaged that they could not be 
used for cargo off-load, and posed a severe risk to all vessels currently moored 
to the pier. 
US Navy Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit (MDSU) 2, and Underwater 
Construction Team (UCT) 1, were activated to assist the joint task force (JTF) 
commander with port-opening operations. The task force was commanded by a 
Navy O-6 and consisted of divers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
The dive team conducted a hasty underwater inspection (of the remaining 
pier) and hydrographic surveys to determine landing sites for Army shore landing 
vessels. (Within 48 hours of the Army’s arrival, the Navy dive teams were on the 
ground, supporting the joint diving task force.) 
The UCT 1 expertise was critical in establishing a plan of action to return the 
port to operational status. Under UCT 1 guidance, the MDSU 2 and 544th divers 
conducted a detailed underwater inspection of the existing port facilities. The 
inspection determined that 200 feet of pier could be repaired using underwater 
concrete emplacement techniques. The JTF immediately began pier repair 
operations. 
Concurrently, salvage operations were underway within the port to clear 
channels of obstacles and obstructions. Under MDSU 2 guidance, the UCT 1 and 
544th dive teams assisted in these efforts to clear a path for Army shore landing 
vessels. For larger ships, MDSU 2 employed a more accurate and automated 
bathymetric survey system. 
The commander used other diving capabilities the dive teams provided for 
various activities. These included hyperbaric chamber operations, medical 
support, small boat support; and side-scan sonar, unmanned underwater vehicle, 
remotely operated vehicles, ship husbandry, and search and recovery 
capabilities. 
The combination of expertise and capabilities used across the operation 
enabled 200 feet of pier to be repaired, the port deemed safe, operational, and 
handed over to Haitian civil authorities within three months. The port opening

DIVE MISSION AREAS 
1. Introduction
Dive mission areas describe capabilities to which military divers may be trained. There 
are 15 dive mission areas, as listed in table 1. Dive mission areas may include 
subcategories, of which some are detailed in this chapter. It is important to note, 
however, that diving units may not be trained in all dive mission areas. For example, a 
dive unit may only be trained in scuba and limited to capabilities in which scuba can be 
used. Refer to appendix A for an overview of Service-specific dive mission areas.

2. Dive Mission Area Descriptions
a. Mobility. Divers provide critical support for water obstacle crossing by supplying
the information needed to determine crossing sites, bridging locations, and time
estimates for reducing or removing obstacles. Divers gather this information by
conducting hydrographic or bathymetric surveys and shore reconnaissance, which
leads to obstacle reduction or removal.
(1) Structural, Bridge, and Fording Site Reconnaissance. Divers determine the
type of construction used and condition of the structure, perform a battle damage
assessment (BDA), and prepare repair estimates. Structural engineer
augmentation may be required. Engineer divers can reconnoiter fording sites and
their near- and far-shore approaches to provide data to higher echelons and help
determine the best fording site.

16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(2) River Reconnaissance Operations (as a full river or sections of a river).
Divers conduct reconnaissance of the near and far shores of a water obstacle to
determine the ability of the site to support future wet gap-crossing operations.
They identify the bottom composition and establish bank slopes, water depths
and velocity, and possible staging areas and rally points on the near and far
shores.
(3) Obstacle Reduction. After identifying obstacles to mobility, divers can remove
or reduce the obstacles using mechanical or explosive methods.
(4) Installing Protective Barriers for Bridging Structures. Divers assist in installing
impact booms, antimine booms, and antiswimmer nets upstream and
downstream of crossing sites. Also, they can inspect these devices routinely for
signs of tampering or damage and repair them.
(5) Underwater Surveys. Dive units can create accurate charts of the waterway’s
bottom and note any obstacles to navigation. A few personnel and small
watercraft (configured with various types of technology packages) can conduct
the initial survey to provide a quick, and fairly accurate, description of the
underwater terrain. If divers find obstructions or receive questionable readings,
they can physically inspect the underwater anomalies. The following are the
three kinds of underwater surveys.
(a) High Resolution. A high-resolution survey involves post-survey data
rendering and aerial photograph overlays, and provides sub meter accuracy.
Survey data can be provided in paper and digital form. High-resolution
surveys take the most time compared to the other types of underwater
surveys.
(b) Medium Resolution. A medium resolution survey provides a graphic
representation of the bottom profile with sub meter accuracy. A digital copy is
available within hours of the survey.
(c) Low Resolution. A low resolution survey provides 1- to 3-
meter/approximately 3- to 9-foot accuracy with a verbal description of the site
and basic markings.
(6) Very Shallow Water (VSW) Operations. Divers conduct advanced force and
preassault mine countermeasures (MCM) and reconnaissance operations in the
VSW zone (from 3- to 12-meter/10- to 40-foot water depths) to locate and clear
potential landing sites in support of joint littoral power-projection operations.
b. Countermobility. Divers aid the countermobility mission by creating obstacles in
and around potential crossing sites. They can emplace underwater minefields and
other explosive and nonexplosive obstacles, and rigging bridges for command and
time fused detonations.
(1) Obstacle Emplacement. Divers can build various types of obstacles designed
to slow or impede the enemy’s ability to conduct wet gap-crossing operations.
These obstacles can be placed underwater with sub meter accuracy, creating
interlocking barriers navigable by allied forces and an obstacle to enemy forces.

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(2) Bridge Structure Demolition. To impede an enemy’s ability to cross bridges,
dive units can demolish bridges to render them impassible. Some dive units have
substantial training in precisely conducting demolitions. These teams, when
augmented with structural engineers, can demolish a bridge in such a manner as
to create an obstacle for the enemy.
c. Protection (Physical Security). Divers can enhance protection in contingency
operations in response to national security concerns (including counterterrorism and
counterdrug operations) and large-scale operations. Divers can rapidly deploy to
secure critical areas. Physical security of bridges, ports, locks, and dams may
include active and passive systems to protect or provide early warning of impending
breaches.
(1) Passive or Active Detection Methods. Divers assist in placing and
maintaining physical security systems in port areas, waterways, and on bridges,
locks, or dams.
(2) Security Inspections. Divers provide security and active early detection of
explosive hazards (EHs) by searching the underside of ships’ hulls and the
adjacent piers. Divers conduct these inspections before vessels enter a facility or
while moored outside a secured perimeter.
(3) Vulnerability Assessments. Divers perform inspections and surveys to
facilitate assessment of vulnerabilities to threats.
(4) Contraband Search. Divers conduct searches on the underside of ships’ hulls
to locate foreign devices and objects.
d. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and EH.
(1) Locate and Mark. An EH is material posing a potential threat that contains an
explosive component such as unexploded explosive ordnance, booby traps,
improvised explosive devices (IEDs), captured enemy ammunition, and bulk
explosives. EHs may be found above or below the waterline. Types of
underwater EHs are sea mines, limpet mines, torpedoes, unexploded ordnance
(UXO) and underwater improvised explosive devices. Underwater EHs may be
located on the seafloor, on ship hulls, on pier pylons and in the vicinity of port
and underwater infrastructure. Without disturbing EHs once they are located,
divers should record all identifying EH features and mark the location so that
EOD can reacquire expeditiously.
(2) Render Safe or Dispose of Underwater Ordnance and EHs. EOD forces
detect, locate, access, identify, diagnose, render safe/neutralize, recover, exploit,
and dispose of weapons and explosives that threaten personnel, property, and
lines of communications. For underwater EHs, water depth will be a factor when
determining EOD response. For instance, it might be possible to access EHs
within a few feet of the surface with little to no diving capability required.
However, for deeper EHs, diving equipment will be required. For maritime mine
threats, Navy EOD MCM platoons (PLTs) are equipped with special low influence
signature gear to operate in close proximity to influence initiated ordnance.
10 
ATP 3-34.84/MCRP 3-10.2/NTTP 3-07.7/ 
16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
NOTE: Navy EOD has very unique and specific requirements when conducting 
underwater EOD operations. Navy EOD is the only Service EOD that is manned, 
trained, and equipped to perform underwater render safe procedures and 
conduct EOD dive operations. 
(3) Marine Mammal System Operations. The marine mammal system (also
referred to as MMS) detachments are tasked through the global force
management process for worldwide MCM and force protection missions or to
provide support to fleet commanders for MCM contingencies. These PLTs can be
supported from a well deck-equipped amphibious ship or from expeditionary
shore facilities within small boat range of the area of operations. The PLTs
provide an enhanced capability for underwater MCM in the shallow water and
VSW zones of the littoral battlespace. The PLTs provide an enhanced capability
to detect, identify, mark, render safe, recover, and neutralize objects within the
water column to include mine hunting and neutralization operations against
bottom, moored, and buried mines in the shallow water and VSW zones.
e. Infiltration and Exfiltration. These operations use diving as a means to circumvent
enemy lines and defenses to facilitate follow-on missions, such as offense, defense,
or stability.
f. Maritime Disablement Operations. These operations use diving as a means to
install or deploy devices to disable or reduce maritime vessels’ ability to maneuver.
This operation can be conducted on static or moving vessels. The maritime
disablement operations are nondestructive and temporary.
g. Underwater Ship Husbandry. Ship husbandry is in-water vessel inspection,
maintenance, and repair. Vessel inspections are performed to assess the condition
of the underwater hull and appendages. These inspections cover all parts of the
vessel below the waterline and are part of a scheduled or emergent maintenance or
damage assessment.
(1) Inspections.
(a) Hull inspections assess damage and identify buildup from marine growth
on the hull, and the condition of antifouling paint surfaces.
(b) Propulsion and steering systems inspections check the condition of
shafts, propellers, and rudders, and the serviceability of protective coatings,
seals, and bearings.
(c) Vessel appendages inspections check the general condition and
operational ability of the vessel.
(2) Maintenance. Underwater maintenance tasks include hull cleaning; replacing
sacrificial anodes; maintaining cathodic protection systems; replacing worn or
corroded nuts, bolts, and screws; maintaining fairing in hydrodynamic surfaces;
and servicing any items that would fall into disrepair if they are not maintained.
Maintenance procedures require hand tools, pneumatic or hydraulic tools, and
other special equipment, such as hull-cleaning devices.

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(3) Repair. Most underwater repairs are intended to be permanent. Tasks
consist of removing and replacing hull appendages, sealing cracks or separated
seams, and performing mechanical and metal repairs. Divers may accomplish
repairs in a wet environment or a cofferdam (a watertight enclosure pumped dry
to permit construction work below the waterline).
(4) BDA and Repair. BDA and repair provide immediate assistance to a vessel in
distress. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) can be used to inspect and assess
areas of damage and provide real-time video feed to repair facilities via satellite.
Repairs are temporary and are meant to keep the vessel afloat until permanent
repairs are made. Divers conduct BDAs and repairs in a semi-permissive or
permissive environment. BDA and repair capabilities are grouped into two
categories. They are:
(a) Temporary Repair. Install small damage control plugs as well as design
and emplace patches.
(b) Permanent Repair. Wet weld large patches and repair or replace
underwater propulsion and steering systems.
h. Underwater Construction. Underwater construction is the construction,
inspection, repair, or  removal of in-water facilities in support of military operations.
An in-water facility can be defined as a structure, system, device, or utility adjacent
to, floating upon, or submerged in a freshwater or marine environment including in
shore, rivers, and lakes. Pipelines, cables, sensor systems, and fixed or advanced
base structures are examples of in-water facilities. More information on ocean
construction may be obtained from Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command
(NAVFAC) Ocean Facilities Program managers. Underwater construction planning
resources can be found in: Navy Tactical Reference Publication (NTRP) 4-04.2.8,
Conventional Underwater Construction and Repair Techniques; NTRP 4-04.2.9,
Expedient Underwater Construction and Repair Techniques; and NAVFAC P-992,
UCT Arctic Operations Manual.
i. Port and Harbor Clearance. Port and harbor clearance operations include
facilities’ opening, construction, clearance, and rehabilitation. Ports, harbors, and
inland waterway facilities are fundamental to moving personnel and equipment for
any military operation. Inspection, maintenance, and repair of these facilities can
greatly contribute to the long term success of phased operations. Facilities can be
improved for friendly forces and civil relief, or modified to deny use by the enemy.
(1) Planning and Inspection. Divers assist in planning port operations to help
determine priorities of work or prepare work estimates. A completed inspection
can provide the area commander with a report of existing conditions of
underwater port facility structures.
(2) Hydrographic and Bathymetric Survey. Divers conduct surveys to depict
water depths, bottom contours, and obstruction locations to determine the size of
ship a port can support.
12 
ATP 3-34.84/MCRP 3-10.2/NTTP 3-07.7/ 
16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(3) Clearance. Divers undertake clearance operations to neutralize or reduce
obstacles blocking shipping channels in ports, loading facilities, mooring sites,
marine railways, dry dock facilities, lock and dam structures, and other navigable
waterways.
(4) Repair. Repairing port facilities is more desirable than initial construction
because it requires far less time and fewer resources. A repair may involve
underwater and surface operations and will depend on closely integrating divers
and general engineer assets. Inspecting and repairing structures may require
specialized equipment and additional support personnel.
(5) Construction. Constructing new ports and facilities is a major undertaking,
requiring an extensive use of divers. Divers provide valuable information during
the initial site selection and survey. Divers conduct hydrographic surveys of the
proposed area to determine water depths, sea bottom contours, shipping
channels, and underwater obstacle locations. New port or facility construction
would require additional support personnel working with diving assets.
j. Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS). JLOTS operations occur when Navy and
Army logistics over-the-shore (LOTS) forces conduct LOTS operations together
under a joint force commander. LOTS is the process of loading and unloading ships
without the benefit of deep-draft capable, fixed-port facilities; or as a means of
moving forces closer to tactical assembly areas. Divers support JLOTS operations
through the following tasks.
(1) Survey. Divers conduct a survey of the operation site, including an
underwater bottom profile, to determine potential LOTS operation sites. Dive
units create sub-meter accurate charts of the bottom and note any obstacles to
navigation. The initial survey can be conducted by a few personnel with small
watercraft (configured with various types of technology packages) which will
provide a quick, and fairly accurate, description of the underwater terrain. If
obstructions are found or there are questionable readings, divers can conduct a
physical inspection of the anomalies.
(2) Obstacle Reduction. After identifying obstacles to LOTS sites, divers can
remove or reduce obstacles using mechanical or explosive methods.
(3) Medium Salvage (Objects Weighing 10 to 75 Tons). In the event supplies are
lost overboard, dive units can search the area to locate the submerged
equipment. Depending on the size and depth of the submerged equipment,
divers will attach lifting devices to the object for surface cranes to raise. If
overhead lift support is not available, divers can attach inflatable bags and
pontoons to the object, float it to the surface, and tow it into shore.
(4) Anchoring System Recovery and Repair. During LOTS operations, a ship’s
anchor and anchor chains may become entangled in underwater cables, caught
on reef structures, or wrapped around sunken objects. Divers can unfoul an
anchor and anchor chain so the surface vessel can get underway. Anchors may
also become detached from their chains and cables. Divers can locate and
reattach them.

13 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(5) Anchoring Systems to Stabilize Causeway. Divers imbed anchoring systems
into the seafloor to provide greater stability to a causeway during rough seas.
k. Offshore Petroleum Discharge System (OPDS). OPDSs are designed to facilitate
the high-volume movement of bulk, liquid cargo from ship to shore and are used
extensively during fuel transfer operations. Divers and transportation watercraft
groups play important roles in preparing, installing, repairing, and operating OPDSs.
Divers are required to support OPDSs by performing the following actions.
(1) Installing a single-anchor leg mooring (SALM) system. The SALM system is
emplaced as a mooring station and discharge manifold providing a semi-
permanent installation for bulk fuel transfer directly from an offshore tanker to
port storage.
(2) Conducting hydrographic surveys to determine beach gradient, underwater
contour, and geotechnical information.
(3) Improving beach approaches.
(4) Clearing enemy emplaced or natural obstacles from beach approaches.
(5) Anchoring underwater pipelines to the seafloor.
(6) Inspecting pipelines and their components.
l. Salvage. Major salvage operations include clearing and removing submersed or
sunken vessels, equipment, supplies, or other materials from port channels, berthing
and docking facilities, mooring sites, lakes, lock and dam facilities, and other
navigable waterways. A diver’s ability to salvage vessels or other equipment
depends on the type, size, and location of the object and the time available for the
salvage effort. Salvage methods range from simple to large-scale operations
requiring complex integration of surface-support assets, including multiple vessels
and lift assets. There are three categories of salvage operations: light, medium, and
heavy.
(1) Light salvage is done to clear berthing spaces. Objects weighing less than 10
tons are considered light salvage.
(2) Heavy salvage is anything weighing more than 75 tons.
m. Search and Rescue/Recovery. Divers assist in search and rescue/recovery of
personnel and equipment lost in or near water.
(1) Physical searches. Divers use various techniques to locate personnel during
combat, natural disasters, and other emergencies.
(2) Recovery. Recovery operations are focused on recovering personnel,
sensitive equipment, or material of forensic value.
(3) Dewatering. Divers provide dewatering capabilities for vessels impacted by
flooding. Dewatering restores buoyancy to a sunken or partially sunken ship. It
can be completed with pumps, compressed air, and water replacement.
Additional techniques are detailed in the US Navy Salvor’s Handbook, Revision
2, 1 January 2021.

(4) Submarine Disaster Rescue. Operations to recover personnel and equipment
from distressed submarines.
n. Disaster Response Measures. Divers assist local, state, tribal, and federal
authorities after a natural disaster.
(1) Assist in making plans and assessments of damage caused by natural
disasters.
(2) Remove obstacles to navigation in areas damaged or covered by floods,
earthquakes, or other naturally occurring and man-made disasters.
(3) Repair dams, levees, breakwaters, and other man-made retaining structures.
(4) Validate hydrographic surveys by verifying existing charts are accurate and
waterways were not affected by the disaster.
(5) Provide dewatering capabilities for facilitates or areas impacted by flooding.
o. Hyperbaric Chamber Operations. Provide recompression therapy for pressure-
related injuries resulting from flight or diving operations. Dive units may provide their
own hyperbaric chambers. If not, available chambers may be located through the
Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) worldwide web address
(http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/SUPSALV/00C3-Diving/) or by contacting the
Naval Experimental Dive Unit emergency number (850) 230-3100. These are not the
definitive sources for all recompression chambers worldwide but can be used as
planning resources.

Chapter III 
PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
1. Requesting Dive Assets
a. Not every Service can perform every category within each dive mission area and
some Services are not trained at all in some of the dive mission areas.
b. The timelines and scalable diving packages are specific to each Service and are
detailed in chapters IV to IX. Once diving units are in theater, they will be likely task-
organized to the joint task force commander; however, this can change based on the
duration of the diving mission and if follow-on requirements occur. There are two
methods to use to request diving assets. Both methods require the requestor to ask
for a capability, such as one of the dive mission areas, not a specific Service or unit
to perform a mission.
(1) The first method is the standard process through the global force
management, which flows through the combatant command and onward to the
Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense, upon approving the request,
would task the Service chiefs who have the ability to complete the request. This
method processes nonemergent, noncontingency diving requests.
(2) The second method is to request diving assets through Service Authority.
This is the method of request used when there is an emergency or an unplanned
mission needing diving assets. Tactical units can reach out to Service diving
entities within their theater by requesting Service authority assistance. An
example is a high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle roll over with either
immediate personnel or sensitive equipment recovery or recovery within a strict
timeline. Then, the unit needing diving assets could first determine which Service
has diving assets closest to their location, using the diving contact list in
appendix B, and contact that Service command to request Service authority
assistance. The Navy has two references for how to request diving assistance.
(a) The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) has published step-
by-step instructions on how to request Navy salvage and recovery assets
based on the situation in OPNAV Instruction 4740.2H titled Salvage and
Recovery Program, specifically section 7, Procedures.
(b) Pacific Fleet and Fleet Forces commands provide instructions on how to
request Navy diving assets, see Commander Pacific Fleet/Commander US
Fleet Forces Instructions 4740.1K, titled Salvage, Recovery, Towing, and
Offshore Oil Spill Response Operations, which provide guidance such as in
figure 2. The instructions also include a sample salvage situation report
format.

Figure 2. Salvage Response Process 
c. When considering diving operations, it is imperative that planners understand the
first 12–24 hours can make the difference between an accident (a ship grounding

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
that can be refloated), and a disaster (a ship gets driven ashore or broken up by 
seas creating an environmental and military crisis). If diving capabilities are required 
and diving assets are not already assigned to the command, NAVSEA can provide 
immediate technical direction for initial triage and assist the unit with potential asset 
requests. 
2. Considerations When Using Dive Assets
a. Dive-Site Security. Most dive teams have a limited self-defense capability. Plan to
provide site security at the support facilities and around the dive site.
b. Logistic and Environmental Considerations. Dive operations have specific
logistical and environmental considerations that must be addressed during planning.
These considerations will determine the manning, equipment, qualifications, and
time required to accomplish the mission. Planners requesting dive capabilities
should provide as much information about the operating environment as possible.
Table 2 provides a minimum checklist to assist in initial coordination.
Table 2.  Dive Unit Initial Coordination 
This checklist is an example of what could be asked when a unit is requesting dive assets. These items are not 
all inclusive and could change based on which Service is in the theater and requires support. Timely dive unit 
notification, with as much of the basic information listed below as possible, will increase the degree of mission 
success. Use weather observers and forecasters, on-scene personnel, the Internet, and any other available 
sources to gather data. 
1. Determine the required capabilities.
a) Dive Mission Area(s).
b) Subcategories.
2. Determine requested location for dive or linkup
location with dive units.
a) Grid Coordinate or Latitude/Longitude.
3. Point of Contact for Requesting Unit.
a)
Higher Headquarters Point of Contact (Contact
Number).
b)
Dive Unit Point of Contact (Contact Number).
4. If known, provide the following information to
assist the dive unit: 

Permissive or nonpermissive dive site.

Water contamination.

Air and water temperatures.

Water depth.

Current.

Tide charts.

Underwater visibility.
5. If possible, and as necessary, be prepared to
coordinate logistics for these prior to dive team
arrival:

Hazardous materials transportation.

Compressed gas.

Explosives.

Generators and motors.

Transportation requirements.

Site security.

Fuel (gas or diesel).

Dive platform.

Other.
(1) Logistics.
(a) Transporting and Storing Compressed Air. Dive tanks (full of compressed
air) are not allowed on aircraft without appropriate hazardous material
declarations. If the dive team is transported by air, the tanks may have to be
refilled at the destination. Logistics officers at the tactical units will be able to
coordinate this for the dive units (through the base fire department or area
civilian dive shops). If this is not possible, the dive units will bring
compressors to refill their own tanks.

(b) Diver and Equipment Transportation Requirements. Requesting units
may be tasked to provide transportation.
(c) Diving Platform. Divers operate from a wide variety of platforms, including
piers, shores, barges, boats, and vessels of opportunity. The required
platform depends on the mission. This will be coordinated once the diving
mission is identified.
(d) Other Concerns. If there are additional considerations pertaining to the
US classes of supply, one through nine, they will be detailed in the specific
operation order for the diving mission.
(2) Environmental Conditions.
(a) Contaminated Water. Fuel, biological, or chemical contaminants may be
damaging to dive equipment and hazardous to divers. Additional equipment
or post-dive medical assistance may be required if these conditions exist.
Tactical units requesting diving assistance should communicate any potential
requests to medical personnel. Table 3 provides an overview of which
Services have the best equipment for diving in contaminated water.
(b) Water Temperature. Cold water will reduce submerged times for divers
and may require additional equipment or manning, such as the cold weather
diving equipment or cold weather clothing. The tactical unit requesting the
diving assets can provide this information.
(c) Water Depth. Deep dive operations reduce submerged times for divers.
Maximum operating depths depend, in part, on equipment.
(d) Currents. If currents are greater than one knot, the diving unit must be
informed prior to its arrival.
(e) Tide Charts. Tidal phases may influence water depth and currents at the
dive site. Tide charts are included in the initial briefing of the operating
environment or can be requested through the weather officer.
(f) Underwater Visibility. Low visibility may increase the time required to
accomplish a task. For example, if searching an area for a piece of
equipment, low visibility may require a dense search pattern or alternate
search technique.
(g) UXO. The presence of UXO may require additional considerations for the
type of dive being conducted, which would require the diving team to bring
specialized underwater demolition tools.

Chapter IV 
UNITED STATES ARMY DIVING 
1. Overview
The United States Army has two types of divers: engineer and special operations. The 
engineer divers specialize in conducting diving operations in support of combat, defense 
support of civil authorities (DSCA), general engineering, and geospatial engineering. 
Engineer dive detachments have a diverse range of capabilities and are able to conduct 
nearly every dive mission area, with only limited capability in the EH and ordnance 
disposal category. Special operations divers are members of a special forces (SF) team 
and will be discussed in detail in Chapter VIII, Special Operations Forces Diving. 
2. Engineer Divers
Note: For a detailed description on Army engineer diver capabilities, see Technical 
Manual 3-34.83, Engineer Diving Operations, 2 August 2013. 
a. Mission. The engineer diving detachment conducts diving operations in a
maritime environment in support of combat, general engineering, geospatial
engineering, and DSCA. Engineer divers provide support to assure mobility for the
forward movement of troops and equipment. Divers provide support to disaster
response, general engineering, and geospatial engineering operations in and around
water. Divers enhance protection by conducting force protection swims and
emplacing underwater obstacles and barriers. Divers also enable expeditionary
logistics by providing accurate waterway datum, surveys, and repair of existing
waterfront facilities.
(1) Engineer diving missions assist in infrastructure support and sustainment
operations.
(2) Dive detachment capabilities can be tailored to the mission allowing the use
of surface-supplied diving apparatus; scuba; and ROVs.
b. Capabilities. Engineer divers can rapidly deploy scalable assets to perform scuba
diving and surface-supplied diving in nearly all environmental conditions: swift water;
zero visibility; multiple levels of contamination; day or night; under-ice; and in rivers,
harbors, or open ocean. The Army has tasked 13 of the 15 dive mission areas to its
engineer divers. They are the following.
(1) Mobility.
(2) Countermobility.
(3) Protection (physical security).
(4) EH and ordnance disposal (limited capability, can only locate and mark).
(5) Underwater ship husbandry.
(6) Underwater construction.
(7) Port and harbor operations.

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(8) JLOTS.
(9) OPDS (limited due to the inability to install a SLAM system).
(10) Salvage (can only conduct light and medium).
(11) Search and rescue/recovery.
(12) Disaster response measures.
(13) Hyperbaric chamber operations.
c. Task Organization. Engineer dive detachments are relatively small, specialized
organizations assigned as theater assets and may be assigned or attached to
supported units anywhere within an area of operations. Engineer dive detachments
consist of 25 personnel and a full complement of diving equipment to support Army
engineer dive capabilities. Each detachment can be split to conduct simultaneous
dive operations at multiple locations. Figure 3 depicts an engineer dive detachment
organization.
Figure 3. Engineer Dive Detachment Organization 
d. Concept of Employment. The primary objective of engineer diving operations is to
conduct underwater engineering and disaster response operations. Engineer divers
are an integral part of a task organization that supports movement in or around any
wet gap-crossing, including ports, harbors, inland waterways, beachfronts, and
rivers. For short-term missions, diving assets are assigned, in direct support, to the
supported commander. For long-term or complex missions, divers are attached to a
company- or battalion-sized unit.

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
e. Tiered Rapid Deployment Capability. Engineer divers can rapidly deploy assets
to respond to time-sensitive emergencies. The following are tier deployment
capabilities and timelines.
(1) Tier one. Less than 48 hours from notification to departure from the current
station. Requires a 4- to 7-Soldier dive squad capable of conducting:
(a) Emergency response and a rapid assessment.
(b) Search and recovery.
(c) Engineer reconnaissance, inspections, and hydrographic surveys.
(d) Antiterrorism or force protection swims.
(e) Vessel inspections and maintenance.
(f) Underwater demolition.
(2) Tier two. Fewer than 5 days from notification or tier one assessment.
Requires an 8- to 14-Soldier dive element (can be two squads) capable of all tier
one capabilities plus:
(a) Light construction operations.
(b) Minor ports, harbors, and inland waterway repair.
(c) Light salvage operations.
(3) Tier three. Fewer than 7 days from notification or tier one and two
assessments. Requires a 25-Soldier dive detachment capable of all tier one and
two capabilities plus the 13 dive mission areas listed in paragraph 2. (Tier one
and two capabilities are detailed in chapter II).
f. Employment Considerations and Limitations. Engineer divers do not possess
organic transportation assets, so planners must make arrangements for support to
meet tiered deployment timelines. Engineer divers will require a security detail.
Engineer diving units have organic equipment to support diving operations to a
depth of 190 feet.
3. SF Missions
SF maritime operations are some of the many options available to a commander to 
infiltrate and exfiltrate a detachment into or out of a designated area of operations to 
execute SF missions. Other missions for SF combat divers include tactical 
reconnaissance, demolition raids against bridges and other maritime structures, and 
underwater searches for security and recovery. SF divers are covered in more detail in 
chapter VIII.

Chapter V 
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS COMBATANT DIVING 
1. Overview
The primary purpose of the Marine combatant diver is to provide a clandestine 
infiltration and exfiltration means for USMC ground reconnaissance elements, which 
facilitates the full range of amphibious reconnaissance and ground reconnaissance 
operations for Marine reconnaissance units, Marine special operations forces 
(MARSOF), and other supported commanders. (See chapter VIII for MARSOF dive 
mission capabilities.) The USMC underwater reconnaissance capability provides the 
supported unit commander with a capability to conduct clandestine subsurface 
operations in support of the force. Combatant diving is one of numerous specialized 
insertion and extraction methods used by Marine ground reconnaissance units to 
infiltrate and exfiltrate mission areas.  
Note: For a detailed description of USMC diver program management, see Marine 
Corps Order 3150.4A, Marine Corps Diving Policy and Program Administration, and 
Marine Corps Reference Publication (MCRP) 2-10A.6, Ground Reconnaissance 
Operations, with Change 1. 
2. Marine Combatant Divers
a. Mission. Marine combatant divers conduct underwater operations to facilitate
amphibious reconnaissance, ground reconnaissance, surveillance, and operational
environment shaping in support of the Marine expeditionary force (MEF), other
Marine air-ground task forces, or the Marine Corps component of a joint force.
b. Capabilities. Task-organized USMC ground reconnaissance elements plan,
coordinate, and execute over the horizon, clandestine, subsurface dive operations
via naval ships or aircraft to conduct full-spectrum amphibious and ground
reconnaissance missions. USMC ground reconnaissance elements are manned,
trained, and equipped for dive operations in the following mission areas.
(1) Conduct amphibious reconnaissance to collect and report information about
the activities and resources of an enemy or information concerning the
hydrographic characteristics of a particular area, well in advance of an
amphibious landing force.
(2) Conduct subsurface hydrographic surveys in support of all US Navy landing
craft and amphibious assault vehicles.
(3) Conduct initial and confirmatory beach reconnaissance.
(4) Conduct initial terminal guidance of amphibious assault vehicles, tactical
boats, amphibious ships, landing craft, and aircraft.
(5) Conduct subsurface insertion and extraction of combatant dive teams to
clandestinely infiltrate and exfiltrate designated ground reconnaissance mission
areas and other reconnaissance and battlespace shaping operations.

16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(6) Conduct subsurface infiltration and exfiltration in support of specialized
reconnaissance of littoral and coastal areas and defenses; including ports,
harbors, piers, and estuaries; and fords and bridges.
(7) Conduct subsurface limited search and recovery of personnel or sensitive
equipment.
(8) Conduct search operations for the amphibious ready group, expeditionary
strike group, and maritime pre-positioning ship in fleet support of force protection
to locate and mark limpet mines and IEDs. These operations include ship’s hulls,
piers, harbors, ports, fords and bridges.
c. Task Organization.
(1) The USMC combatant dive capability resides within the Active and Reserve
Component reconnaissance battalions and force reconnaissance companies. A
complete list of USMC units with an organic dive capability and their geographic
locations is provided in appendix B.
(2) USMC ground reconnaissance units are task organized to conduct the full
range of ground reconnaissance missions, including combatant diving. The
commander of deployed USMC ground reconnaissance elements and the
supported unit will plan, direct, and coordinate the actions of USMC combatant
dive teams. The general organization of the Marine combatant diver capability
within task-organized reconnaissance elements is as follows.
(a) Reconnaissance battalion: 13 dive teams each.
(b) Reconnaissance company: 3 dive teams each.
(c) Force reconnaissance company: 4 dive teams each.
d. Concept of Employment.
(1) A Marine ground reconnaissance unit employs six-person teams to conduct
reconnaissance. The unit can be employed in general support of the MEF or in
direct support or attached to a subordinate unit of the MEF or a joint force.
(2) Marine reconnaissance PLTs are assigned to the ground combat element of
each forward-deployed Marine expeditionary unit (MEU). If a company-sized
element is assigned to a MEF or another subordinate unit, the company
headquarters (HQ) will establish and maintain a reconnaissance operations
center in support of the MEF or supported unit’s combat operations center to
conduct command and control functions of subordinate units conducting ground
or amphibious reconnaissance missions.
(3) USMC reconnaissance PLTs can be task-organized and attached to
subordinate units of the MEF or a joint force. Under such employment, the PLT
HQ will establish and maintain a reconnaissance operations center in support of
the supported unit’s combat operations center.

27 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
e. Employment Considerations. Marine combatant divers have unique
considerations for their employment. The following must be considered when
employing Marine combatant divers.
(1) MEUs possess the organic tactical boat assets to conduct over-the-horizon
surface movement to a dive insertion point. The USMC tactical boat asset is the
combat rubber reconnaissance craft, which has very limited applicability in this
mission area.
(2) For planning purposes, the average speed for surface and subsurface
swimming for Marine combatant divers is one knot, unassisted. This translates
into a maximum distance of one nautical mile, subsurface, under ideal conditions.
Assisted by the diver propulsion device, the average motorized speed is 1.2
knots. Due to less expended energy, the diver propulsion device increases the
distance a dive team is able to travel.
3. MARSOF Combatant Divers
A MARSOF maritime operation is one of the many options available to a commander to 
infiltrate and exfiltrate a detachment into or out of a designated area of operations to 
execute special operations forces (SOF) missions. Other missions for MARSOF 
combatant divers include special reconnaissance, direct action raids against maritime 
structures, and underwater searches for security and recovery. MARSOF divers are 
covered in detail in chapter VIII.

special operational support. They can operate from vessels of opportunity
(VOOs), shorelines, and fixed waterfront facilities in varying maritime settings.
The conditions can be open ocean, inland, riverine, coastal, or littoral and may
include water temperatures ranging from polar to tropical/desert conditions, swift
water and contaminated water.
b. MDS Companies Capabilities.
(1) Rescue, Salvage and Recovery. MDS forces primarily, conduct expeditionary
salvage and diving operations. These operations encompass the entire spectrum
of diving and salvage operations, from providing humanitarian assistance to
supporting combat operations. They enable friendly forces increased access to,
and freedom of movement throughout, the maritime and riverine operating
environments. MDS forces provide rescue, salvage, and recovery capabilities
including:
(a) Stabilization, retraction, refloating, dewatering, salvage of ships, aircraft
and watercraft, items of national interest, and strategic assets.
(b) Damage assessment.
(c) Port recovery and harbor clearance.
(d) Emergency underwater ship husbandry.
(e) Shallow water search and recovery (<300 feet of water).
(f) Submarine search and limited rescue.
(g) High-value object recovery.
(h) Rigging and crane related services.
(i) Rigging for and augmented towing.
(j) Explosives employment in underwater ship husbandry.
(k) Manned and unmanned underwater inspection, search, location, and
detection.

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(o) Prisoner of war and missing in action underwater identification and
support.
(p) ROVs.
(q) Rigging ships for tow at sea.
(2) Enabling Area Access. This is a proactive means to ensure forces can freely
enter and exit the theater of operations enabling increased access and freedom
of movement throughout the maritime and riverine operating environments.
Subcapabilities to enable area access include:
(a) Port, harbor, riverine, and waterways assessment and clearance.
(b) Manned and unmanned underwater inspection, search, location, and
detection.
(c) Hydrographic surveys.
(d) Aids to navigation operations.
(e) Beach clearance and salvage.
(f) Stabilization, retraction, refloating, dewatering, and salvage of ships,
aircraft, spacecraft, and watercraft; items of national interest; and strategic
assets.
(g) Search and recovery.
(h) Demolition.
(3) BDA and Repair. BDA is the practice of assessing damage inflicted on a
target. MDS can provide BDA and repair for vessels in distress needing
immediate assistance and located in remote, semipermissive or permissive
environments.
(4) Force Protection. MDS has a limited self-defense capability. MDS forces can
conduct preventative actions to mitigate hostile actions against Department of
Defense (DOD) personnel, resources, facilities, and critical information. For
MDSU, force protection does not include direct action against the enemy or
protecting against accidents, weather, or disease.
(5) Diving and Salvage used for DSCA and humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief operations.
(6) Fly away recompression chamber teams diagnose and treat decompression
sickness and other diving and aviation related illnesses.
c. Task Organization. There are two MDSUs, with locations to cover east and west
coasts of the US.
(1) MDSU 1 is stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and is tasked through Pacific
Fleet. MDSU 1 has seven MDS companies. Figure 4 depicts an MDSU company
organization.

16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(2) MDSU 2 is stationed at Little Creek, Virginia and is tasked through Fleet
Forces. MDSU 2 has five companies. Each company is staffed with 17 divers,
including one diving officer and one master diver. Within the MDSU, there is an
area search PLT (listed in figure 4 as PLT 2), which consists of eight personnel,
when it is fully manned.
Figure 4. MDSU Company Organization 
d. Concept of Employment. MDSU deploy MDS companies to support salvage
operations. MDSUs can deploy multiple MDS companies, simultaneously, to support
larger operations. In these cases, deploying units can be augmented with a
deployable command and control cell to provide control and direction for a task
group commander exercising control over larger expeditionary salvage operations.
(1) MDS companies are equipped with a diverse range of diving and salvage
equipment deployable, scalable, and tailorable according to mission objectives;
employ the full spectrum of surface supplied, open and closed circuit, self-
contained, and recompression chamber diving.
(2) MDSU companies provide expeditionary salvage, clearance reconnaissance,
BDA, underwater explosive demolition, site survey, lightweight towing, and
aircraft recovery with a craft of opportunity. A MDSU company can exploit
available retrograde or abandoned opposition-force craft and assets to augment
a mission. An MDSU company has an organic capability of air dives to depths of
190 feet. Dives deeper than 190 feet and mixed gas to depths of 300 feet utilizing

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
MK16 underwater breathing apparatus and surface supplied diving systems. 
Heavier salvage capability is represented in the emergency ship salvage 
materials equipment pool. This equipment is provided by the MDS parent 
command or through the in-theater emergency ship salvage materials pool. Due 
to their size, MDSU companies are limited in their ability to provide self-protection 
and may require nonorganic force protection when in a nonpermissive 
environment. 
(a) Area search PLTs employ underwater scanning, ROV and unmanned
underwater vehicle (UUV) capabilities to:
Search for, locate, identify, and mark designated targets in support
of MDSU operations.
Scan harbor bottoms and waterways to enable freedom to
maneuver.
Restore access to ports and facilities.
(b) The primary mission of the area search PLT is to provide a capability to
detect and localize submerged objects in support of salvage operations.
These units are equipped with side-scan sonar, ROVs with a variety of
sensors, and expeditionary equipment to conduct area search operations via
organic small craft. Due to their small size, area search PLTs are limited in
their ability to provide force protection and require nonorganic, waterborne
force protection when in a nonpermissive environment.
3. Navy UCTs
a. Mission. Navy UCTs conduct inshore and deep-ocean facility underwater
construction, inspection, repair, and maintenance operations in climates ranging
from the arctic to desert and tropical regions. UCTs support amphibious landing
operations and deploying the OPDS in support of JLOTS. Other supported missions
include: foreign humanitarian assistance, DSCA, and recovery operations. The
UCTs conduct:
(1) Responsive underwater engineering and construction, inspection, repair,
maintenance, and demolition of ocean and waterfront facilities. This is in support
of Navy, Marine Corps, and combatant command operations in permissive and
combat environments. When assigned by fleet commanders, UCTs accomplish
additional underwater construction projects for other naval commands,
laboratories, and offices.
(2) Diving operations to provide underwater construction in support of other
naval construction force units, amphibious operations for naval beach groups,
operating forces, sealift support facilities, and other fleet units, as directed.
(3) Installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of undersea range facilities
and in-shore cables for undersea surveillance systems.
(4) Foreign humanitarian assistance, humanitarian mine action, humanitarian
aid, disaster response, DSCA, and military civil action activities.

16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
b. Capabilities. UCTs are capable of scuba and surface supplied diving operations
in nearly all environmental conditions. These include zero visibility, contamination,
day or night operations, and ice diving in rivers, harbors, and open-ocean. UCT
capabilities and functional tasks include the following.
(1) Underwater Engineering and Construction, Repair, and Maintenance. This
includes shallow and deep-water structures, mooring systems, underwater
instrumentation, light salvage, and precise demolition.
(2) Inspection.
(a) The UCTs conduct hydrographic surveys using differential Global
Positioning System and hydrographic survey systems to collect data within
sub meter accuracy. Survey teams can be rapidly deployed to perform field
data collection and postprocessing operations using a small boat deployable,
mobile workstation or vessel of opportunity. Advanced underwater
reconnaissance techniques include bathymetric surveys to sub meter
accuracy, side-scan imagery, still photography, and full-motion video.
(b) The UCTs operate ROVs to a depth of 500 feet. They can deploy
vertically or horizontally. Hydrographic survey data can be georectified and
processed in the field by the UCT construction diving detachment and sent to
HQ via organic high-frequency radio, ultrahigh frequency radio, or satellite
communications.
(c) This information assists commanders in assessing battle damage;
avoiding navigational hazards; locating debris in support of ports, harbors,
and inland waterway recovery operations. It also assists in locating and
recovering lost equipment and selecting locations for installing underwater
facilities (such as pilings, moorings, and cable landings).
(3) Data Collection. The UCT collects water-crossing data for bridging
operations.
(4) Blasting and Demolition. The UCT performs precision terrestrial and
underwater blasting using military or commercial explosives.
c. Task Organization. The two UCTs are commanded by a civil engineer corps
officer who specializes in ocean engineering and are permanently structured units
composed of personnel with the capability to plan, coordinate, and supervise general
engineering and construction diving operations. The UCTs are organized into sea
duty and shore duty components. Figure 5 depicts the UCT organization, with the
shore and sea duty components.
(1) The shore duty component is comprised of support departments that consist
of administration, engineering support, supply, equipment and material readiness,
communications, medical, and training. These are the garrison staff elements,
which only deploy in exceptional circumstances.
(2) The sea duty component of each UCT consists of independent, worldwide
deployable construction diving detachments, comprised of personnel capable of

conducting marine and terrestrial construction operations. The construction diving 
detachments can be task-organized to support various mission or operation sets. 
Figure 5. UCT Organization 
d. Concept of Employment. Each UCT functions independently, as an integral unit
of the naval construction force. UCTs operate with decentralized control providing
specialized underwater and general engineering services to the supported unit.
UCTs are deployed as independent construction diving detachments equipped and
trained for self-sufficiency in underwater construction to respond to emergency and
contingency operations to support underwater construction and repair in any
environment. The UCTs also provide:
(1) The UCT can deploy a certified Construction Diving Detachment (CDD) or
battle staff with weapons; procedures, guidance, and information (PGI); and a
light table of allowance (TOA) package within 48 hours of receiving an execute
order. The UCT can deploy additional CDDs with personnel and TOA within 96
hours of receiving an order.
(2) Trained and equipped construction diving detachments to conduct defensive
combat tactics. The UCTs can conduct force protection operations on open water
and urban terrain. Due to the UCTs’ small unit size, specialized equipment, and
expertise, they employ these tactics in direct support of construction diving
operations only. The UCTs require assistance from the supported unit with
transportation, perimeter security, and waterfront security operations in
nonpermissive environments.
(3) Construction diving operations in permissive and nonpermissive
environments in climates ranging from extreme cold weather to tropical or desert.

(1) Expeditionary MCM companies are dedicated capabilities that support the
mine warfare (MIW) missions to search, classify, map, acquire, identify, re-
acquire, countermine or neutralize, recover or exploit, and dispose or eliminate
hazards. Some hazards include floating, bottom, volume, and buried sea mines
and IEDs that impede freedom of navigation and are comprised of: one MCM
PLT, one unmanned system (UMS) PLT, one postmission analysis cell, and one
expeditionary MCM HQ.
(a) EOD MCM PLT. These types of PLTs are dedicated to supporting the
MIW mission and are functionally organized to locate, identify, neutralize,
recover, exploit, and dispose of underwater ordnance and EHs impeding
maneuver for friendly forces. MCM PLTs support other MIW platforms and
units, but are capable of limited independent MCM operations.
(b) UMS PLT. These types of PLTs, primarily, provide mine exploration,
reconnaissance, and hunting capabilities in support of MCM operations. In
addition, they provide fleet support for the purpose of recovering objects,
mapping other items of interest, and performing intelligence preparation of the
operational environment. Their focus is on the search, classification, and
mapping underwater mines and other hazards impeding friendly forces
dominant maneuver. Each UMS PLT is task organized to support
simultaneous operations in two disparate locations.
(c) Expeditionary MCM HQ. These HQ are functionally organized to provide
command and control over normal manning for an expeditionary MCM HQ
element.
(d) MCM PLTs. MCM PLTs provide diving and demolition support,
intelligence collection, range clearance, and underwater clearance. They also
provide shore detachment augmentation, riverine operations, Chief of Naval
Operations project support, contingency, and special operational support.
MCM PLTs can be a force multiplier to support aircraft and ordnance
recovery.
(2) Area Search PLT. This type of PLT employs underwater scanning, ROV and
UUV capabilities to search for, locate, identify, and mark designated targets in
support of MDS and EOD operations. An area search PLT scans harbor bottoms
and waterways to enable freedom to maneuver and restore access to ports and
facilities.
c. Task Organization. The Navy organizes EOD forces to support combatant
commanders. EOD officers within each numbered fleet, combatant commands, and
theater special operations command provide staff planning support for operational
EOD activities. (See a force structure flow chart in figure 6.) EOD warfare-qualified
officers are the subject matter experts for maritime MCM and can direct MCM
operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

relating to movement, control (when exercising operational control), readiness
and training, administration, and logistics. They are organized to deploy as a
commander, task force controlling Navy EOD and expeditionary salvage forces
or as the core of a joint EOD task force. Group staff EOD-qualified personnel
may be selectively mobilized, individually, as liaison officers to support local,
regional, littoral, or wartime EOD tasks. The EODGRU exercises Service
authority over assigned EOD forces to provide EOD services to the operational
commanders through explosive ordnance disposal mobile units, MDSUs, EOD
expeditionary support units, and EOD training and evaluation units. For additional

is to reach a distressed submarine within 96 hours. Its mission is worldwide 
submarine assessment, intervention, and rescue. 
b. Capabilities. The unit’s capabilities include a ROV, submarine rescue chamber,
pressurized rescue module, and two launch and recovery systems. The submarine
rescue chamber can rescue up to six persons at a time and reach a bottomed
submarine at depths of 850 feet.
c. Task Organization. The Undersea Rescue Command is homeported at Naval Air
Station North Island, Coronado, San Diego, California. The unit is comprised of
approximately 150 personnel. This includes active duty officer and enlisted Sailors,
contractors, and reservists.
d. Concept of Employment. The explanation of the multiple components within this
command follow.
(1) The Undersea Rescue Command uses a McCann rescue chamber operated
by two crewmembers and lowered to the submarine in peril using a tether. Once
the chamber reaches the submarine, it seals over the submarine’s hatch,
allowing Sailors to be safely transferred to the rescue chamber from the
submarine. The submarine rescue chamber is the main component of the
submarine rescue chamber flyaway system, which is capable of worldwide
submarine rescue missions. Once launched, the submarine rescue chamber
flyaway system can operate around the clock. The chamber consists of upper
and lower compartments. The upper compartment is maintained at atmospheric
pressure and contains operators, passengers, and controls. The lower
compartment is flooded at ambient sea pressure and blown dry to transfer
personnel after mating with a submarine. It contains a downhaul drum and
spooling device. The ballast tanks are normally dry, but flooded during the mating
process to add weight.
(2) The pressurized rescue module, called Falcon, is a tethered, remotely
operated submarine rescue vehicle. It can dive to depths up to 2,000 feet and
mate with a disabled submarine trapped on the sea floor up to a 45-degree angle
in pitch and roll. Two crewmembers operate the pressurized rescue module,
which can rescue up to 16 people at a time. The module is the main component
of the submarine rescue diving and recompression system, which can be flown
anywhere in the world to rescue either US or partner nation submariners in
distress. The submarine rescue diving and recompression system is designed for
quick worldwide deployment in the event of a submarine accident. The module is
transportable by truck, aircraft, or ship.
(3) The ROV, Sibitzky, consists of a 13.5 foot operations van, a 6.5 foot spares
van, a winch with 3,000 feet of soft umbilical cord, a launch and recovery system,
and the vehicle. The vehicle weighs 2,000 pounds, is variably buoyant and has a
maximum depth of 2,000 feet. It consists of six thrusters for maneuvering, five
high-definition cameras for intervention and salvage, two robust manipulators
capable of lifting 100 pounds each, a front-looking sonar system, and an
advanced navigation system that allows station keeping so the pilot can focus on

the work at hand. The ROV is the main component of the 
assessment/underwater work system, which also includes a launch and recovery 
system, and flyaway sonar and associated support equipment. This is the first 
system mobilized in the event a submarine becomes disabled. The system will 
help confirm and mark the disabled submarine, assess surrounding conditions, 
clear debris from a submarine’s hatch and provide emergency life support stores 
replenishment.

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE DIVING 
1. Overview
The United States Air Force (USAF) employs combat divers to conduct three missions: 
personnel recovery (PR), global access, and precision strike. There are USAF divers 
assigned to Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Reserve Command, the Air 
National Guard, and Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and United States Air Forces in Europe 
(USAFE), all as part of the Guardian Angel weapon system; and to Air Force Special 
Operations Command (AFSOC). The USAF Guardian Angel divers deploy as full units 
(squadrons) and do not have scalable diving packages. AFSOC special tactics combat 
divers employ dive teams as part of special tactics teams (STTs). 
Note: For a detailed description of USAF diver program management, see Air Force 
Instruction 10-3504, Dive Program, 28 January 2021. 
2. USAF Guardian Angel Combat Divers
a. Mission. USAF Guardian Angel combat divers are Pararescuemen and Combat
Rescue Officers. Their primary mission is to affect PR across the range of military
operations providing capabilities to support a joint force commander’s objectives and
directly impact the theater security cooperation goals. Guardian Angel forces plan,
prepare, execute, and assess PR operations. Executing PR operations includes the
doctrinal execution tasks of report, locate, support, recover, and reintegrate. PR
pertains to the recovering personnel only; however, Guardian Angel forces perform
other recovery operations, to include recovering sensitive technology.
b. Collateral Missions. These include casualty evacuation, civil search and rescue,
emergency aeromedical evacuation, and humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief. Furthermore, they provide international aid, noncombatant evacuation
operations, support for National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight
operations, special operations missions, and support to the President of the United
States.
c. Capabilities. Guardian Angel is organized as an independent ground force with
the ability to be augmented by enablers as mission requirements dictate. Guardian
Angel is deployed in proximity to specialized aviation assets that can provide rapid
access across the area of operations. Guardian Angel’s ground force capabilities are
employed by conducting sea, land, and air warfare tasks to recover isolated
personnel and sensitive equipment. In addition to being employed as ground forces,
Guardian Angel personnel can act as individual augmentees to other joint and
coalition forces.
d. Task Organization.
(1) Guardian Angel dive capability resides within the USAF PR dive rescue and
recovery in the Active and Reserve Components’ Guardian Angel rescue
squadrons. Rescue squadrons deploy with individual and team dive equipment,
watercraft, and aerial delivery equipment to provide commanders a dive search

and rescue capability. See figure 8 for an illustration of a Guardian Angel 
organization. 
(2) The theater USAF PR dive rescue and recovery capabilities are embedded in
expeditionary rescue squadrons and may be collocated with rescue-specialized
fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. These squadrons are task organized to provide
full-spectrum PR missions, including recovery of personnel and sensitive
equipment.
Figure 8. USAF Guardian Angel Organization 
e. Concept of Employment. The USAF employs combat divers as part of the
combatant commander’s PR capability and provide a rapid response search and
rescue/recovery capability. USAF PR forces are designed to penetrate hostile areas
to rescue/recover isolated personnel or sensitive equipment. PR divers are open
circuit or closed circuit combat divers and skilled in shallow water search and
rescue/recovery operations. They can conduct dives from shore or surface craft in
bodies of water at elevations up to 10,000 feet mean sea level. They can conduct
PR operations up to contaminated water category 3. Once assigned to a combatant
commander, PR divers are part of the joint force air component commander’s PR
force. In this capacity, they maintain an on-call alert with USAF fixed- and rotary-
wing aircraft to provide a quick response, in-land PR capability for combatant
commanders.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES DIVING 
1. Overview
SOF maritime operations are options available to a commander to infiltrate and exfiltrate 
a detachment into or out of a designated area of operations to execute SOF missions. 
Examples of missions for SOF divers include: tactical reconnaissance, demolition raids 
against bridges or other maritime structures, and underwater searches for security and 
recovery (of personnel or equipment). SOF combat divers are task organized in 
accordance with the assigned mission, and are aligned under a joint special operations 
task force.  
2. US Army Special Forces (SF)
a. Mission. SF use dive operations when required to execute any mission, including
infiltrating and exfiltrating into or out of a designated area of operations. Other
missions for SF combat divers include tactical reconnaissance, demolition raids
against bridges and other maritime structures, and underwater searches for security
and recovery.
b. Capabilities. SF combat divers use closed circuit oxygen rebreathers to make low
visibility, underwater approaches to land or maritime targets. These approaches are
the last legs of longer infiltration routes that may use air, surface, submarine, or a
combination of movement assets. Open circuit scuba diving is used for nontactical
search and recovery. The following six dive mission areas are identified for SF
combat divers.
Note: For detailed descriptions, see ATP 3-18.12, Special Forces Waterborne 
Operations, 14 July 2016.  
(1) Mobility.
(2) Countermobility.
(3) Protection (physical security).
(4) Infiltration and exfiltration.
(5) Search and rescue/recovery.
(6) Hyperbaric chamber operations.
c. Task Organization. Each SF battalion is comprised of three SF companies. Each
company has six SF operational detachments. One detachment per company is
designated as a combat dive team. Therefore, each SF battalion has three combat
diving teams.
d. Concept of Employment. The primary objective of SF diving operations is to
conduct stealthy approaches to preselected beach landing sites where the assault
force transitions environments to conduct missions ashore. This may be the most
advantageous avenue of approach, and combined with other movement techniques,
extends infiltration and exfiltration ranges.

3. Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARFORSOC)
a. Mission. MARFORSOC recruits, organizes, trains, equips, and deploys task-
organized, scalable, expeditionary MARSOF worldwide to accomplish special
operations missions assigned by United States Special Operations Command
(USSOCOM) or combatant commanders via the theater special operations
commands.
b. Capabilities. MARSOF combatant divers are capable of performing the following
dive mission areas:
(1) Mobility.
(2) Infiltration and exfiltration.
(3) Protection (physical security).
(4) Search and rescue/recovery.
c. Task Organization. Headquarters MARFORSOC is located at Camp Lejeune,
North Carolina. Subordinate commands within MARFORSOC, that maintain a
combatant dive capability, are the Marine Raider battalions. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
Marine Raider Battalions are located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Each
battalion has four Marine special operations companies. Each company has four
Marine special operations teams (MSOTs) with qualified combatant divers.
d. Concept of Employment. MSOT dive teams employ scuba, MK 25, and the diver
propulsion device for subsurface, clandestine entry into nonpermissive, uncertain, or
hostile environments where MSOTs transition to conduct missions that may include
direct action or special sensitive reconnaissance.
4. Navy SEAL Team
a. Mission. NAVSPECWARCOM is the USSOCOM lead component for special
operations conducted in and around all maritime environments.
NAVSPECWARCOM trains, equips, organizes, provides resources for, deploys, and
sustains naval special warfare (NSW) forces. This is in support of the Commander,
USSOCOM and other combatant commander requirements, including maritime
direct action, special reconnaissance, security force assistance, and foreign internal
defense.
b. Capabilities. NSW forces are tasked with maritime missions that require
sophisticated combat diving skills which facilitate the clandestine approach and
assault on targets by swimmers beneath, at, and from the waterline. NSW-unique
combat swimming operations include:
(1) Combat swimmer ship attack.
(2) Underwater demolition raids.
(3) Harbor reconnaissance.
(4) Submerged hydrographic reconnaissance.
(5) Underwater obstacle demolition.

AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(6) Maritime disablement operations.
c. Task Organization. The NAVSPECWARCOM HQ is a USSOCOM echelon II
command located in San Diego, California.
(1) NSW task groups are task organized into three NSW task units, comprised of
up to three PLTs each. Each NSW task unit can operate as a full task unit or
three individual PLTs. Moreover, when NSW task units deploy, they may also
include elements of a special boat detachment, a cross-functional detachment of
combat support personnel (e.g., EOD or interpreters), an unmanned aerial
vehicle system detachment, or a combat service support detachment. In any of
these configurations, NSW task groups have great flexibility in the manner they
can operate, either as a small contingent, or as an integrated cell within a larger
amphibious or land-based force.
(2) The SEAL delivery vehicle team has a similar NSW task unit level capability
and configuration. These SEAL delivery vehicle task units conduct direct action
and special reconnaissance missions from various surface and subsurface
platforms in support of national and combatant command priorities.
d. Concept of Employment. SEAL combat swimmers specialize in clandestine,
direct action, and special reconnaissance missions in permissive and nonpermissive
environments. NAVSPECWARCOM employs an array of open-circuit, semi-closed
circuit, and closed circuit underwater breathing apparatuses to meet force readiness
objectives.
5. United States Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) Special Tactics
Combat Divers
a. Mission. Special tactics units provide the interface between sea, air, and land
assets to synergize the capabilities of each. They produce precise sea, air, ground,
and space power effects in the operational environment for special operations and
conventional forces.
b. Capabilities. AFSOC special tactics combat divers employ dive teams as part of
special tactics teams (STTs). STTs are task-organized and may include combat
controller, special tactics officer, pararescuemen, combat rescue officer, and special
reconnaissance. They employ and operate by sea, air, and land in all environmental
conditions and terrain. Once assigned to a combatant commander, STTs are part of
the joint special operations component. In this capacity, special tactics combat
divers may be attached to other components. All special tactics core capabilities can
use combat dive as a means of infiltration and exfiltration.
(1) Precision Strike. This is the ability for joint forces to locate, survey, discern,
and track objectives or targets; select, organize, and use the correct munitions;
generate desired effects; assess results; and reengage with decisive speed and
an overwhelming operating tempo, as required. These include:
(a) Terminal control operations.
(b) Joint terminal attack control.

16 June 2023 
AFTTP 3-2.75/CGTTP 3-95.17 
(2) Global Access. Global access provides capabilities from air, land, space, and
cyberspace domains to affect an adversary’s warfighting capacity and to set the
conditions required by joint forces. Global access enables the strategic reach of
long-range missiles and multipurpose combat aircraft for a variety of
complementary missions across the range of military operations. These include
the following.
(a) An assault zone assessment or survey.
(b) Terminal control operations in support of global access.
(c) Specialized reconnaissance.
(d) Weather operations and environmental reconnaissance.
(3) Personnel Recovery. PR is the ability to report, locate and positively identify;
support, extricate, recover, evaluate; provide triage for, stabilize, transport to
definitive care; and reintegrate personnel and equipment during SOF and
humanitarian operations.
c. Task Organization. AFSOC, Hurlburt Field, Florida.
(1) Special tactics combat dive capability resides within the Active and Reserve
Components’ special tactics squadrons (STSs). The commander of the
expeditionary special tactics unit plans, directs, and coordinates the actions of
dive teams as part of STTs. The 123rd STS and 125th STS Air National Guard
units augment the 24th Special Operations Wing.
d. Concept of Employment. Air Force STS employ open- or closed-circuit dive
teams as part of the special operations component commander’s forces. In this
capacity, special tactics divers may be attached to other components or conduct PR
or global access in support of the joint special operations component, and may be
tasked to support one or more components of a joint force during the same
campaign. When employed in a forward theater of operations, special tactics assets
are assigned to an expeditionary STS reporting directly to the joint special
operations air component commander.

Chapter IX 
UNITED STATES COAST GUARD DIVING 
1. Overview.
a. Although the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is not a DOD entity, a few of its
dive missions overlap with some of the DOD’s dive mission areas. These include
categories within mobility, protection (physical security), EH and ordnance disposal,
and port and harbor clearance operations. The USCG military diver is trained in both
scuba and surface supplied diving systems. Divers are trained in the use of
underwater tools and advanced search and recovery techniques to perform such
complex underwater tasking as aids to navigation or cold water ice diving
operations.
Note: For detailed descriptions of policy and procedures for the administration, 
application, training and execution of all diving operations within the United States 
Coast Guard can be found in the Diving Program Manual, Commandant Instruction 
(COMDTINST) M3150.1D.  
b. Mission. The USCG dive mission is to provide diving capabilities and other
subsurface equipment and technologies to support all subsurface needs of the
Service. These capabilities are available to support the 11 statutory USCG missions.
c. Capabilities. USCG divers provide the following support to the 11 statutory USCG
missions.
(1) Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security. USCG dive teams conduct
subsurface inspections of piers, vessels, and adjacent shorelines to detect,
identify, and mark underwater threats. These include mines, parasitic devices,
IEDs, hazards to navigation, or other conditions that may hazard a vessel or
critical infrastructure.
Note: Coast Guard divers are not capable of conducting Render Safe Procedures. Only 
qualified EOD divers must attempt to render safe underwater ordnance or IEDs. 
(2) Aids to Navigation. Divers provide the ability to conduct extensive,
independent aid to navigation operations requiring minimal support. Divers can
inspect moorings, change out buoys and chains, salvage sunken buoys, and lift
buoy sinkers. Dive teams dive from small boats allowing them to work on aids to
navigation in shallow water that are not accessible by buoy tenders. The ability to
conduct fly-away aid to navigation missions in the aftermath of tropical storms
affords an immediate response in the event a buoy tender cannot arrive on scene
in sufficient time to reestablish commerce. This mission includes providing
subsurface capabilities for aid to navigation units and waterways managers in
support of the maritime transportation system.
(3) Drug Interdiction. The mission includes subsurface searches and inspections
of piers, bridges, vessels, adjacent shorelines, and any other maritime
infrastructure or structure to detect, identify, mark, and recover potential
contraband.

(4) Defense Readiness. This mission includes operations, exercises, and joint
training with other US military Services and allied and partner nations. This
mission also includes underwater ship husbandry tasks in support of defense
readiness for the underway fleet.
(5) Other Law Enforcement. This mission includes search and recovery of
weapons, human remains, and other evidence in support of USCG law
enforcement or other agencies. USCG divers provide diving subject matter
expertise support for USCG investigations and case prosecution.
(6) Migrant Interdiction. This mission includes assisting in the enforcement of
immigration laws at sea to interdict and process illegal and undocumented
migrants as far from US shores as possible. USCG divers provide support to this
mission set as requested by operational commanders.
(7) Marine Safety. This mission includes a variety of underwater tasks that
support maritime safety. These include such as identification and removal of
hazards to navigation, channel clearance for reestablishment of maritime
transportation systems following natural or man-made disasters, and assistance
in marine casualty investigations.
(8) Living Marine Resources. This mission includes environmental surveys and
search/recovery of derelict fishing nets and other marine debris. It also includes
oceanographic research and scientific sampling.
(9) Marine Environmental Protection. This mission includes oil spill response,
hazardous materials response, other search and recovery, and investigation of
hazards to the marine environment.
(10) Ice Operations. This mission includes hull maintenance, damage
assessments, and repair of USCG ice breakers and other cutters operating in the
polar latitudes, and other mission areas requiring subsurface capabilities in the
vicinity of floating ice environments. The US Navy-USCG Memorandum of
Agreement on the Operation of Ice Breakers of 22 June 1965, commits the
USCG to maintaining diving and salvage services in polar latitudes.
(11) Search and Rescue. This mission includes, but is not limited, underwater
search, identification, and potential rescue or recovery of persons, vehicles,
vessels, and aircraft.
2. Task Organization.
a. The USCG has designated three primary duty regional dive lockers (RDLs) which
all function within the Operations Department of USCG Maritime Security Response
Team West (MSRT West). The names and locations of each dive locker are:
(1) Regional Dive Locker East, Portsmouth, Virginia.
(2) Regional Dive Locker West, San Diego, California.
(3) Regional Dive Locker Pacific, Honolulu, Hawaii.

b. USCG RDLs were primarily designed, resourced, and equipped to support Coast
Guard ports, ports waterways and coastal security; aids to navigation; ice
operations; and defense readiness missions. RDLs operate in diverse environments
that include the inland, coastal, offshore regions; homeland and US littorals; polar
regions; and open ocean for subsurface operations. RDLs are organized to support
all primary missions as a deployable, adaptive force package provider with
capabilities to perform both pre-planned and short notice operations. RDLs can
rapidly deploy a dive team within 24 hours of notification to conduct subsurface
operations in most global environmental conditions.
c. The RDLs operate under the operational control and tactical control of MSRT-
West commanding officer. Tactical control is normally delegated to a sector
commander or specific joint, interagency, or coalition task force commander. The
most demanding projected operating environments for a RDL is a short notice
deployment to an arctic environment.
d. Each RDL has 15- to 18-active duty diver billets assigned under the supervision
of a command diving officer.
e. When deployed, RDLs have limited organic logistics capabilities. The supported
commander must provide berthing, messing, medical care (other than first
responder), appropriate towing vehicles, and marine support platforms with
adequate capacity for operations.
f. RDLs are equipped, trained, and outfitted to conduct operations in the following
environments:
(1) Inland, coastal, and offshore zones as well as homeland and US littorals,
forward regions and open ocean segments with direct logistical support in all
regions the USCG executes missions.
(2) Air temperatures ranging from tropical climates (over 100° F) to arctic
conditions (-30° F), and water temperatures ranging from 95º F to 28º F.
(3) Day and night conditions.
(4) All underwater visibility conditions, from zero to unlimited.
(5) RDLs can respond to intelligence driven events or be pre-positioned.
(6) RDLs require external support for all organizational and depot level
maintenance for engineering and electronics equipment.
3. Inter-Service Operations.
a. All US military divers receive the same baseline training and strictly follow the
diving protocols set forth in reference SS521-AG-PRO-010.
b. USCG divers are authorized to operate with other US military diving units to the
extent that qualifications allow.
(1)
USCG divers are authorized to integrate only with other US military divers.
USCG divers must not serve as the diving supervisor or designated person in
charge of non-US military divers. USCG divers may operate in the vicinity of and

in coordination with non-US military dive teams. Performing any diving, 
supervising, or other diving related roles with non-US military divers is prohibited. 
(2) When conducting inter-Service diving operations, the unit leading the mission
is responsible for verifying the qualifications of all divers
4. Employment Considerations and Limitations
USCG divers shall not be employed as combatants.

Appendix A 
DIVE MISSION AREA UNIT CAPABILITY CHART 
Table 4 provides a breakdown of capability by dive unit type. The units are grouped with 
their Services and categorized by either full or limited capability. 
Full capability means this dive mission area is a primary task this unit is trained and 
equipped to conduct. Limited capability means this dive mission area is a task this unit 
may be able to perform based on skill sets inherent in primary tasks. However, the unit 
may be limited by equipment or the unit has not trained to this task. 
Dive teams consisting of personnel from different Services are possible, but require 
additional coordination compared to those composed of a single Service. There have 
been instances where multiple Services are involved in a diving operation. For example, 
Army divers do not necessarily specialize in underwater ship repair on Navy ships. 
However, if Army divers are the only dive team in an area, Naval Sea Systems 
Command or Navy Expeditionary Combat Command can provide an engineer or subject 
matter expert who can augment the Army dive team to provide the technical knowledge 
and authority to conduct repairs on Navy ships. It is important to understand that, as 
needed, divers can augment units already in theater to accomplish nearly any diving 
operation.

DIVE POINTS OF CONTACT LIST 
When conducting planning for an operation, it is important to have knowledge of where 
all the diving assets are stationed across the Services. This is helpful if Services need to 
request diving assets across Services or would like diving assistance for an exercise or 
would like to request diving assets prior to a deployment. Table 6 provides a point of 
contact list.

COMMON EQUIPMENT 
1. Description of Common Equipment
Note: Dive units have multiple equipment packages based on the type of mission and 
term of deployment. Contact units for transportation considerations since most 
packages are scalable to meet mission requirements. 
a. Rebreather. Rebreathers are closed-circuit oxygen or mixed-gas underwater
breathing apparatuses primarily used by the United States Special Operations
Command community. This equipment combines the mobility of a free-swimming
diver with the depth advantages of mixed gas. The term closed circuit refers to the
recirculation of 100 percent of the mixed-gas breathing medium and results in
bubble free operations. There are multiple rebreathers across the Services, these
include the MK 25, MK 16, and Viper.
b. Scuba. Scuba divers do not need to be tethered. Scuba divers are limited by the
amount of air in their tanks and to currents up to one knot.
c. Surface Supplied Diving. Divers are tethered by an umbilical which provides
surface-stored air to the diver. Surface supplied equipment gives a diver relatively
unlimited air and allows dives to depths of 190 feet of seawater (FSW) using air or
300 FSW using mixed gas (helium and oxygen). A diver using surface-supplied
diving equipment can work in currents up to 2.5 knots, any current above 1.5 knots
requires additional weights. Surface-supplied divers have limited mobility based on
the length of their air supply hose, typically 300 to 600 feet.

Operational Considerations: 
A hyperbaric chamber may be required for any dive based on risk and planning
considerations.
Scuba dives deeper than 100 FSW require additional equipment and risk assessment
mitigation. This diving is not common.
Scuba dives deeper than 130 FSW require commander approval.
Notes: 
1. MK 25, MK 16, and MODE are closed-circuit, mixed-gas, underwater breathing
apparatuses.
2. Viper is a closed-circuit, mixed-gas rebreather model underwater breathing apparatus.
