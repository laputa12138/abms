Chapter 1 
PROCEDURES AND CONCEPTS 
1.1.  Overview.  Almost without exception, a joint force commander (JFC) designates the 
Commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) for a C-MAJCOM or C-NAF as the joint force air 
component commander (JFACC), and the resulting air component commander requires 
appropriately sized and configured C2 capabilities to effectively command and control the Air 
Force Service component and joint air forces made available for tasking.  An air component 
commander’s C2 capabilities should include an air component staff and an air Air Combat 
Command operations center (AOC).  This AFI (AFI) provides guidance on an air component 
staff’s organization, processes, and training required to accomplish its functions as an AFFOR 
staff as part of the air component. 
1.1.1.  An AFFOR staff and its AOC work together to perform warfighting functions and 
tasks and assist the air component commander to fulfill air component responsibilities to the 
JFC.  The air component staffs also help commanders of Air Force service components fulfill 
their United States Code Title 10 responsibilities for administration and support, which 
include the organization of service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel 
management, logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization and 
demobilization, and discipline. 
1.1.2.  During smaller-scale contingencies or day-to-day operations, an air component 
commander may tailor capabilities or teams described herein and the division of workload 
between an AOC and air component staff depending upon the requirements of the air 
component commander, mission requirements, and resources available. 
1.1.3.  An AFFOR staff consists of functionally oriented directorates, sometimes also called 
an “A-Staff,” a command section, a personal staff, and any required liaisons. 
1.1.4.  The AFFOR staff is responsible for the operational planning that occurs outside the air 
tasking cycle (e.g., contingency planning), to include the support of all phase requirements in 
the guidance for employment of the force, any joint strategic campaign plans, the global 
force management implementation guidance, and the global force management allocation 
plan. 
1.1.5.  The AFFOR staff is the vehicle through which the air component commander fulfills 
operational and administrative responsibilities for assigned and attached forces across the 
competition continuum.  In the steady state, the AFFOR staff performs administrative 
responsibilities, to include organization, training, equipping, and sustainment of AFFOR.  
The AFFOR staff also plans, executes, and assesses operations in support of the combatant 
commander’s (CCDR’s) theater campaign strategies and plans. 
1.1.6.  The AFFOR staff must establish responsive RegAF and air reserve component (ARC) 
augmentation to provide exercise and contingency support across the competition continuum.  
(T-1).  AFFOR staff should be prepared to use available resources until augmentation arrives 
and is integrated, making maximum use of total force integration, and support relationships. 
 
 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
5 
1.1.7.  The air component commander may prescribe other functional and specialty processes 
not provided in this AFI based on Combatant Command (CCMD) operations and activities, 
to include the declaration of certain Air Force forces as “organic” to an Air Force service 
component and the fulfillment of responsibilities specific to commercial support operations. 
1.1.8.  Specific air component’s, and ARC aligned air component unit’s, training program 
requirements are listed and explained in Chapter 6.  Personnel should be designated and 
formally trained to support assigned missions. 
1.1.9.  Readiness Reporting.  Air component staff readiness is reported in accordance with 
AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting. 
1.1.10.  Higher headquarters inspections and staff assistance visits are scheduled and 
conducted in accordance with AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System, and applicable 
major command (MAJCOM) supplements. 
1.1.11.  On behalf of the air component commander, an AFFOR staff develops, plans, 
monitors, executes, and assesses appropriate Service plans in support of the CCDR’s theater 
campaign plans.  The AFFOR staff also helps the air component commander:  develop 
steady-state strategy to support the CCDR’s strategy; contribute to the development of 
CCDR steady-state campaign plans and security cooperation country plans; develop 
campaign support plans in support of CCDR campaign plans; develop security cooperation 
country support plans in support of CCDR security cooperation country plans; recommend 
and implement policy and rules of engagement for the conduct of steady-state operations, 
including planning, execution, and assessment; and provide commander’s intent to inform 
tactical-level planning, execution, and assessment.  On behalf of the air component 
commander, an AFFOR staff also develops program and budget requests that comply with 
CCDR guidance on warfighting requirements and priorities and informs the CCDR and any 
intermediate JFCs of program and budget decisions that may affect joint operation planning. 
1.1.12.  The AFFOR staff is responsible for translating strategic direction into operational 
requirements and tactical action.  To do so, the AFFOR staff issues mission-type orders on 
behalf of the air component commander to direct the actions of subordinate units outside of 
the scope of the air or cyberspace tasking orders and to synchronize joint, interagency, 
intergovernmental, and multinational efforts toward desired end states.  Examples of such 
orders may include setting a baseline force protection condition, directing the move of a unit 
to another operating base, and overseeing the execution of steady-state or security 
cooperation operations.

Chapter 3 
AIR COMPONENT HEADQUARTERS ORGANIZATION 
3.1.  General.  The air component is responsible for supporting CCDR requirements across the 
range of military operations and at all levels of war.  A C-MAJCOM or a C-NAF is the air 
component to each unified CCMD.  Figure 3.1 depicts an example of an air component 
headquarters organization.  Units shall specify approved variances to Figure 3.1 in a unit 
supplement to this AFI.  (T-3).  Any proposed variances must first be approved via an 
organization change request outlined in AFI 38-101, Manpower and Organization.  Table 3.1 
depicts air component headquarters.  (T-2). 
3.2.  Component-MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM). 
3.2.1.  A C-MAJCOM is a MAJCOM that is the AF component to a unified CCMD.  It is 
commanded by the air component commander and includes supporting staff, one or more C-
NAFs/numbered air forces, and all assigned and attached forces.  The C-MAJCOM AFFOR 
staff integrates component activities across all competition continuum.  It supports the 
COMAFFOR in developing policy, formulating strategic level guidance, conducting 
administrative management functions, and executing CCDR Title 10 responsibilities to 
accomplish assigned missions, organize forces, and provide authoritative direction over joint 
training; this includes support related to Title 10 and Code of Federal Regulations Title 22, 
Foreign Relations Security Cooperation activities. 
3.2.2.  The C-MAJCOM, when supported by a C-NAF, is responsible for organize, train and 
equip for the MAJCOM.  When not supported by a C-NAF, it must perform all Title 10 
responsibilities, to include organize, train and equip.  (T-1).  Note: During conflict, the C-
MAJCOM should minimize its role in managing Service Secretary Title 10 functions (e.g., 
organize, train, equip, etc.) as necessary when these roles do not directly influence 
operational mission requirements or impact to support the CCDRs.  The C-MAJCOM staff 
should not duplicate the functions of the C-NAF staff or AOC/operations center (OC).  When 
the C-MAJCOM commander is the CCDR’s theater COMAFFOR, the JFC or the 
COMAFFOR may designate a theater JFACC.  Refer to Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-0, 
Operations and Planning, for additional information on component relationships and roles.  
Some MAJCOMs are both C-MAJCOMs and lead MAJCOMs and may support both CCDR 
and Secretary of the Air Force functions respectively.  C-MAJCOM commanders may elect 
to combine C-MAJCOM and C-NAF functions to achieve enhanced efficiency, effectiveness 
or responsiveness to Combatant Commands. 
3.3.  C-NAF. 
3.3.1.  A C-NAF is a specialized category that is structured to perform an operational and 
warfighting mission in support of a unified or subordinate unified CCMD.  The C-NAF is a 
command echelon directly under a C-MAJCOM/MAJCOM.  When the C-NAF is part of the 
C-MAJCOM, the C-NAF plans, commands, controls, executes and assesses all-domain 
operations and capabilities across the range of military operations.  A C-NAF supports the air 
component commander at the operational level.  When designated as the air component to a 
unified CCMD, the C-NAF supports the CCDR at the operational level, and the C-NAF 
commander is the air component commander.

AIR COMPONENT STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES 
4.1.  General.  The air component staff supports air component requirements and integrates air 
component capabilities into the CCDR’s joint force planning in coordination with an AOC/OC 
and other OCs.  The staff implements and establishes the air component commander policies and 
procedures (supplemental to CCDR policies and procedures) within the theater of operations.  
The air component commander is the single commander of an air component assigned or 
attached to a JFC.  The air component staff must establish processes to ensure integration with 
the CCMD staff, other service component staffs, the C-MAJCOM, the C-NAF, subordinate 
units, partner nations, governmental and non-governmental agencies for all phases of military 
operations.  (T-1).  The air component staff plans, organizes, conducts and assesses steady-state 
campaign activities in support of the CCDR’s campaign plan and conducts service, joint and 
multinational exercises.  Air component tasks and responsibilities may include command section 
support, public affairs (PA) office, protocol office, staff judge advocate office, strategic level 
theater security cooperation planners, and base operating support liaisons (as required to ensure 
the component receives the required support).  Establishing a transition plan, to include 
command structures prior to a crisis scenario, is essential to continuity of operations.  Command 
relationships should be in accordance with Joint Publication (JP) 1, Doctrine for the Armed 
Forces of the United States, policy or per Secretary of Defense operational/contingency orders.  
Air component staffs will establish command and control relationships (i.e., operational control, 
tactical control, support).  As an example, the formation/reception of new units (coalition, joint, 
service, etc.) within a theater and the ability to effectively command and control those units is an 
essential element of planning.  (T-2).

4.5.  Functional Advisors. 
4.5.1.  Director of mobility forces (DIRMOBFOR).  The DIRMOBFOR is the air component 
commander’s designated coordinating authority for air mobility with all commands and 
agencies both internal and external to the JTF and serves as the primary interface for other air 
mobility operations occurring in theater.  To ensure close coordination with the overall 
theater air effort, the DIRMOBFOR should establish direct liaison authority with 
USTRANSCOM, geographic CCDR J4, and other elements of the joint deployment and 
distribution enterprise.  The DIRMOBFOR coordinates with the AOC/OC’s air mobility 
division for mobility issues.  The air component commander may elect to establish a 
permanent DIRMOBFOR staff position or source from within their theater to meet 
provisional requirements, or the air component commander may request the AMC 
commander nominate a DIRMOBFOR to meet provisional requirements.  When unfilled, the 
C-MAJCOM or C-NAF's air mobility division chief may act as the DIRMOBFOR for daily 
operations when designated by the air component commander.  The DIRMOBFOR may also 
assist the A4 staff's logistic planning group (Refer to Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-17, Air 
Mobility Operations, for further discussion.) 
4.5.2.  Director of cyber forces (DIRCYBERFOR).  The DIRCYBERFOR supports the air 
component commander with senior leader perspective and guidance on planning, 
development, integration, and employment of cyberspace capabilities for air component 
operations.  The DIRCYBERFOR facilitates synchronization of efforts to provide cyberspace 
capabilities to achieve JFC objectives and serves the commander in four primary roles: 1) 
principal advisor for cyberspace operations; 2) advocate for cyberspace integration with all-
domain operations, and; 3) focal point to monitor and assist with cyberspace authority 
coordination, mission alignment and staffing activities supporting cyberspace requirements, 
and 4) focal point for planning of theater-level crisis action, adaptive, and exercise 
communications requirements. 
4.5.3.  Commander, Installation and Mission Support Center Detachment.  Provides liaison to 
AFIMSC for intermediate-level oversight, policy, and guidance for installation engineering, 
protection services, chaplain, legacy communications as well as logistical distribution, plans 
and transportation support in order to ensure installation and mission support capabilities.

Chapter 5 
AIR COMPONENT OPERATIONS 
5.1.  General.  The air component staff uses tools, systems and processes to ensure complete 
integration with theater capability providers to exercise air component C2 of air forces.  This 
chapter prescribes air component staff processes that support operational level C2. 
5.2.  Operational Planning.  The COMAFFOR uses the Joint Operation Planning Process for 
Air found in AF Doctrine, Annex 3-0, to assist the Joint Force Commander in developing COAs, 
staff estimates, CONOPS and plans to direct forces made available to accomplish missions.  For 
crisis planning or execution, the air component commander directs the OPG to explore the full 
range of adversary and friendly options and to analyze and compare friendly multi-domain 
capabilities.  The air component staff ensures both the OPG and long range planning group 
engange in a collaborative manner with the AOC/OC and other components.  Team composition 
(e.g., numbers, specialties, skill levels, etc.) is tailored to unique mission demands for geographic 
and functional combatant commands. 
5.2.1.  Operational Planning Group (OPG). The OPG is doctrinally led by the A3 with the 
expertise on the subject/situation being discussed/analyzed and is responsible for translating 
strategic direction into operational requirements and tactical action.  Smaller planning teams 
(e.g., operational planning team, battle staff, etc.) may be formed to support operations (e.g., 
crisis/contingency response, forward deployed C2 operations, etc.).  Operational planning 
applies air resources with joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational efforts for 
current and iterative action to achieve the desired end state.  The OPG develops and/or 
executes plans to provide planning estimates for combat support and calculating force 
deployment data.  During steady state and shaping activities, the OPG provides oversight and 
management for cross-functional efforts and coordination for the air component 
commander’s steady state (theater) mission.  The activities might include limited, short-term 
operations, joint and service exercise, and theater security cooperation engagements. 
5.2.1.1.  The OPG provides the air component commander with operationally relevant 
planning information and provides continuing staff estimates through the commander’s 
estimate process. 
5.2.1.2.  The OPG recommends force application and movement, maintains situational 
awareness, and develops responsive courses of action and adaptive plans in support of C2 
of air assets.  NOTE: Some planning functions do not apply to functional combatant 
command’s component staff.  For example, AMC may not write operation plans/concept 
plans as a component of USTRANSCOM.  However, AMC may write annexes or 
support plans to the CCDR’s plans. 
5.2.2.  The air component staff OPG works in concert with the AOC/OC strategy division to 
develop the air component commander’s joint (or combined) air operations plan.  The air 
component staff develops air component operation plans, operation orders, and other plans 
and orders. 
 
 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
41 
5.2.3.  Campaign Planning.  The air component staff is responsible for developing an air 
component commander campaign support plan and individual country support plans that both 
support CCDR theater campaign plans and include the enterprise related activities required to 
achieve theater and individual country objectives. 
5.2.4.  Boards, Centers, Cells, and Working Groups.  Boards, centers, cells, and working 
groups are regularly scheduled meetings, or as required, to coordinate actions in a cross-
functional forum.  These groups include representatives from within or outside a warfighting 
function and from other commands in some cases.  Membership and composition of each 
meeting depends on the issue or mission at hand.  The meeting is a control measure for 
regulating a specific action, process or function and for formalizing routine staff work under 
a structured approach to support the organization’s decision cycle. 
5.2.4.1.  Effective staff integration is achieved when functional expertise from across the 
staff and from external mission partners is brought together in direct support of the 
commander’s decision requirements, working groups, operational planning teams and 
decision boards, leveraging the analytical capability of the entire staff and mission 
partners to support decision requirements.  The use of such staff integrating elements 
(sometimes referred to as cross-functional organizations and events) makes staff 
coordination more routine; facilitates monitoring, assessment, and planning; and allows 
for the management of activities across the three event horizons (current operations, 
future operations, and future plans). 
5.2.4.2.  The battle rhythm provides the cross-functional collaboration structure for 
managing the AFFOR’s most important resource the time and knowledge of the 
commander and staff.  Coupling the battle rhythm with the staff integration process in 
both steady-state and crisis environments is the best solution for integrating and 
synchronizing tasks and processes toward completing the mission. 
5.3.  Operations.  The air component commander executes command and control of 
assigned/attached forces across the full range of military operations (Table 5.1).  Responsibilities 
include: 
5.3.1.  Manage requirements for the CCDR’s execution of force flow. 
5.3.2.  Provide timely total force accountability and force closure visibility at the tactical and 
operational level for all theater force bed down locations. 
5.3.3.  Ensure readiness of assigned/attached forces through exercises and assessments. 
5.3.4.  Provide oversight and guidance on the sustainment and resupply of assigned and 
attached forces. 
5.3.5.  Interface with AF commands as necessary to ensure assigned/attached forces are 
trained, organized and equipped to conduct theater operations. 
5.3.6.  Develop integrated programs, policies and guidance to execute CCDR force protection 
guidance. 
5.3.7.  Provide reach back support to deployed teams conducting security cooperation 
activities.

5.4.  Command and Control (C2).  The air component commander exercises C2 through the air 
component staff for forces assigned and/or attached.  The air component staff supports the air 
component commander with uninterrupted collection, integration, synchronization, and fusion of 
decision-quality information.  The air component C2 processes are executed through an 
arrangement of personnel, telecommunications and computing technology, facilities, systems, 
and procedures employed by the air component commander through planning, directing, 
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. 
5.4.1.  Air component commander’s decision cycle.  The air component staff enables and 
speeds the air component commander’s decision cycle (Figure 5.1) through actions directed 
by DAFPD 13-1, and defined in JP 3-33, Joint Task Force Headquarters. 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020

Figure 5.1.  Air component commander’s decision cycle. 
 
5.4.1.1.  Monitor.  The air component staff monitors ongoing activities that may influence 
the operational area or future operations.  The current plan or plans is/are the standard for 
measuring ongoing activities.  Although staff members monitor their individual staff 
functions to maintain current staff estimates, the preponderance of inputs come from the 
AOC/OC, logistical support representatives, Department of Defense agencies, 
subordinate forward-based Air Force forces, and host-nation representatives.  Outputs of 
monitoring provide inputs for the assessment process.  These outputs are communicated 
throughout this cycle, within the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF and with higher, lateral, and 
subordinate commands.  Individual functional monitoring is merged into a common 
operational picture to enable the commander to assess and determine new efforts or to 
prioritize ongoing efforts.  The air component staff monitors: 
5.4.1.1.1.  Commander’s critical information requirements and requests for 
information. 
5.4.1.1.2.  Operational situation. 
5.4.1.1.3.  Critical subordinate unit actions. 
5.4.1.1.4.  Critical supporting force actions. 
5.4.1.1.5.  Protection information throughout the force (threat levels and threat 
warnings). 
5.4.1.1.6.  Unit strength, current and projected. 
5.4.1.1.7.  Adversary actions and reactions.

5.4.1.1.8.  Logistics status. 
5.4.1.1.9.  Status of national, theater, and organic intelligence and intelligence-related 
assets. 
5.4.1.1.10.  Agile combat support capability thresholds. 
5.4.1.1.11.  Status of communications systems (confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability). 
5.4.1.1.12.  Assess, monitor, and evaluate progress of security cooperation activities. 
5.4.1.2.  Assess.  The air component staff evaluates progress in designated mission areas 
as measured against the plan to assess impact of events as they relate to overall mission 
accomplishment.  These judgments allow the air component commander and staff to 
determine where operational adjustments are necessary and serve as a catalyst for 
planning.  Key tenets of the assessment process are: 
5.4.1.2.1.  Measuring the overall effectiveness of forces and capabilities during 
military operations, using measures of performance and measures of effectiveness. 
5.4.1.2.2.  Assessing the progress toward accomplishing a task, creating an effect, or 
achieving an objective, using measures of performance and measures of effectiveness. 
5.4.1.2.3.  Analyzing the security, effectiveness, and potential of an existing or 
planned intelligence activity. 
5.4.1.2.4.  Judging the motives, qualifications, and characteristics of present or 
prospective enemy forces. 
5.4.1.2.5.  The air component staff assesses potential impacts to bed down decisions, 
impacts of time-phased force and deployment data, feasibility, and force closure 
estimates. 
5.4.1.3.  Plan.  During planning, the commander and staff adjusts the current plan or 
develop new plans with the purpose of successful completion of the broader mission.  
The air component commander’s planning guidance starts in the initiation phase and 
continues throughout the planning process, setting the conditions for successful plan 
development.  It provides the staff insight into how the commander wants to plan and 
conduct operations.  As the staff continues to plan, the commander provides additional 
guidance such as refining courses of action, identifying items requiring further analysis, 
or modifying parts of the draft operation order.  For more information on planning, refer 
to JP 5-0, Joint Planning and JP 3-30, Joint Air Operations. The air component staff is 
the critical linkage between the joint planning process (JP 5-0) and the air tasking cycle.  
The air component staff works in close coordination with the AOC/OC strategy plans 
team during strategy development and other planning processes.  Air component staff 
planning must enable and support the strategy and combat plans divisions’ efforts, 
ensuring the plans are executable and sustainable from a service component perspective.  
(T-1).

5.4.1.4.  Execute.  The execution process converts the commander’s decisions into 
effective action by subordinate organizations.  Execute functions may occur 
independently or in parallel with AOC/OC operations (e.g., execute plans such as force 
bed down).  This direction is accomplished with the broader purpose of achieving the 
overall mission.  The outputs of the execution process allow the air component 
commander to direct actions to ensure that current orders and directives are completed as 
intended.  The air component staff supports operational missions by: 
5.4.1.4.1.  Guiding the air forces toward mission accomplishment. 
5.4.1.4.2.  Making recommendations to assign missions. 
5.4.1.4.3.  Making course of action recommendations defined during planning. 
5.4.1.4.4.  Prioritizing and allocating resources. 
5.4.1.4.5.  Assessing and mitigating risks. 
5.4.1.4.6.  Assessing the situation and deciding when and how to make adjustments. 
5.4.1.4.7.  Synchronizing out-of-theater support to the joint AOC/OC’s intelligence 
efforts. 
5.4.1.4.8.  Making recommendations to organize assigned and/or allocated/attached 
forces. 
5.4.1.4.9.  Making recommendations to synchronize/de-conflict the actions of 
subordinate commanders. 
5.4.1.4.10.  Synchronizing out-of-theater support for security cooperation efforts. 
5.4.2.  Air component commander’s battle rhythm.  The air component commander’s battle 
rhythm is a logical arrangement of boards, centers, cells, and working groups/activities with a 
clearly defined purpose and outcome.  The joint force headquarters establishes a battle 
rhythm and, within this, the air component commander and subordinate commanders nest 
their battle rhythm.  The battle rhythm is regulated by the flow and sharing of information 
that support the commander’s decision cycle.  The air component commander’s battle rhythm 
consists of the scheduling of a series of meetings, report due times, and other activities.  The 
AOC/OC director and A-staff chief/director of staff collaborate to develop a synchronized 
battle rhythm to provide the commander a timeline for receiving critical information to 
establish set decision points.  The chief/director of staff is the OPR for managing the battle 
rhythm and knowledge management planning. 
5.4.2.1.  The air component staff supports the air component commander’s battle rhythm 
by requesting information updates and providing data to: 
5.4.2.1.1.  Plan the most effective use of assigned, attached and supporting forces to 
achieve the JFC’s strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. 
5.4.2.1.2.  Deploy, bed down, and sustain forces when and wherever needed to 
conduct the full range of military operations. 
5.4.2.1.3.  Disengage, redeploy, and reconstitute forces as needed. 
5.4.2.1.4.  Submit reports based on situations and as required by Air Force directives. 
46 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
5.4.2.1.5.  Conduct operational-level assessments to determine mission and overall 
effectiveness as required by the JFC to support the theater assessment. 
5.4.2.1.6.  Develop course of action alternatives for the air component commander. 
5.4.2.1.7.  Develop service component course of action alternatives and supporting 
actions for the COMAFFOR. 
5.4.2.1.8.  Communicate capabilities to fully integrate strategic and operational 
planning and execution processes to ensure consistency between intent and effect. 
5.5.  Air Component Reporting.  The C-MAJCOM and C-NAF staff processes and creates 
various reports essential for effective C2 of air forces.  These reports are typically processed 
through the staffs C2 node, (i.e., command center, watch cell, etc.) or through the AOC reports 
cell, depending on the organization.  AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP), 
provides guidance on operational reporting. 
5.5.1.  The HQ Air Force operational reporting system provides AF and intermediate 
commands with information necessary to make timely operational decisions.  Within the Air 
Force operational reporting system, operational report Type-3 is used to immediately notify 
commanders of any significant event or incident that should rise to the attention of 
MAJCOM, HQ USAF, or Department of Defense. 
5.5.2.  A commander’s situation report publishes information to higher headquarters to 
enable senior echelons to directly support forces, enable service management during adverse 
situations, and enable higher headquarters to advocate solutions.  The tactical/operational 
situation dictates the level of air component staff participation in formulating the situation 
report. 
5.6.  Air Component Commander Support Capabilities.  Agile Combat Support.  The air 
component staff utilizes tools, systems and processes to manage theater-wide apportionment, 
allocation and distribution of resources in support of operational requirements.  Agile combat 
support provides capabilities to support operational missions at the C-MAJCOM and C-NAF.  At 
the tactical level, commanders and their staffs forecast the consumption of resources associated 
with conducting operations over extended distance and time.  Refer to Attachment 5 for a link 
to the AFFOR C2 Toolkit that includes agile combat support systems utilized by the AFFOR 
staff.  Agile combat support systems support each phase of the operation and provide a key 
component of AFFOR staff support.  If required, the air component commander should identify 
an organization on the air component to lead agile combat support integration and 
synchronization. 
5.7.  JTF HQ.  In addition to the requirement to serve as the core of a service and joint 
functional component to the joint force, the air component headquarters should also be prepared 
to function as the core of a JTF HQ when organizationally capable.  The preferred approach to 
forming a JTF HQ is to use an existing C2 structure.  Typically, this is a CCMD’s Service 
component HQ or a subordinate Service component HQ.  The establishing authority (the CCDR) 
determines the appropriate level based on the scope and scale of the operation and nature of the 
mission. 
 
 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020

5.7.1.  CCDRs may designate an officer as a JTF commander and assigns the air component 
the responsibility to establish a JTF HQ.  The DoD relies on Service component HQ to adapt 
into a JTF HQ, often under crisis planning conditions.  The newly designated JTF HQ may 
require additional resources that are not organic to the core Service HQ. 
5.7.2.  The C-MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM/C-NAF air component staff forms the core of the JTF 
HQ’s J-staff and the service component AFFOR staff (AETF AFFOR Staff).  The AOC/OC 
may forms the core of the JTF HQ.  Depending on the complexity of the JTF mission, the air 
component staff, A-staff/AEW A Staff/AEW, AETF Staff, and JTF J-staff positions may be 
dual, or in some cases triple-hatted (Figure 5.2). For further reference see JP 3-33 and JP 3-0 
Joint Operations.

Chapter 6 
AIR COMPONENT STAFF READINESS AND TRAINING 
6.1.  General.  This chapter provides guidance for air component and designated ARC staff 
training programs.  It establishes training practices, management criteria, and administrative 
practices required for personnel to achieve and maintain air component staff certifications.  For 
the purposes of training, the air component staff is not considered a weapons system. 
6.1.1.  The AFFOR FAM approves unit training objectives for air component staff training 
Air Force global strike command (AFGSC)/A3O; AFSOC/A3O; AMC/A3C; PACAF/CSK; 
USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C; 
1AF 
(AFNORTH)/A3T; 
7AF 
(AFKOR)/A3T; 
12AF 
(AFSOUTH)/A3T and USAFCENT/A3T in coordination with ACC/A3C. 
6.1.2.  NGB/A2/6/3/10Y is the OPR for Air National Guard training and AFRC/A3T is OPR 
for Air Force Reserve training.  Training requirements should be based on the gaining air 
component training programs. NOTE: Due to the nature of their organizational structure and 
differing processes, functional air component staff training program requirements should be 
addressed in functional MAJCOM/Unit supplements.  Refer to Attachment 3 for the Air 
Component Master Training Task List. 
6.2.  Individual Training Waivers.  AF/A3T delegates individual training waiver authority to 
AFGSC/A36; AFSOC/A3; AMC/A3; PACAF/CS; USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3, and ACC/A3.  
ARC aligned units submit individual training waivers through NGB/A2/6C/3/10Y or 
AFRC/A3T.  Reserve and Guard component commanders are the approval authority for initial 
certification, mission certification and continuation training proficiency advancement for 
members when the member demonstrates performance above the syllabus standards. Proficiency 
advancement will not be used as a management tool for the purpose of graduating students or 
completing initial/mission certifications by a specific date.  (T-3). Note: See AFI 36-2101, 
Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) paragraph 3.7. for waiver process and 
evaluating waiver requests. 
6.3.  AFFOR Staff Training.  The AFFOR training program is sequentially phased and 
structured using three training tracks based on an individual’s rank or equivalent civilian 
positions.  Completion of the program is required to attain and maintain certification status.  
Training phases are ICT, MCT, and continuation training.  Training tracks are Basic (E-1 to E-5 
and O-1 to O-2), Intermediate (E-6 to E-8 and O-3 to O-5), and Senior (E-9 and O-6).  
Individuals who have been members of the AFFOR staff prior to October 2018 may be 
grandfathered for initial certification training and subsequent mission certification training as 
determined by the course director in conjunction with the training SQ commander.  AFFOR staff 
members initiate ICT by the 45 day of assignment and must complete ICT no later than 180 days 
after assignment to the Air Force Component HQ.  (T-2). 
6.3.1.  Designated “A staff” personnel (A4 and A5) should attend Joint Capabilities 
Integration and Development System training provided by the Defense Acquisition 
University. 
 
 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
49 
6.3.2.  Initial Certification Training (ICT).  ICT is the first phase of the air component staff 
training program designed to provide baseline knowledge on operational level planning and 
AFFOR staff functions.  ICT provides minimal baseline training of newly assigned air 
component staff by presenting foundational knowledge in order to provide the air component 
commander with specialized expertise to support operational missions and activities.  ICT is 
mandatory for personnel identified on the unit-manning document to ensure only trained 
personnel are matched to those positions. 
6.3.2.1.  ICT Requirements: 
6.3.2.1.1.  Complete the applicable on-line AFFOR staff training courses on ADLS. 
6.3.2.1.2.  Fundamental AFFOR training course, basic track. 
6.3.2.1.3.  AFFOR staff officer training course, intermediate track. 
6.3.2.1.4.  AFFOR senior staff officer training course, senior track.  Note: 
Completion of the AFFOR intermediate staff course (AISC), or AFFOR senior staff 
course (AFSSC), may be substituted for the on-line course to satisfy ICT 
requirements. 
6.3.3.  The following courses are highly recommended to provide increased breadth and 
depth of knowledge (either in ICT or MCT): 
6.3.3.1.  AFFOR AISC and civilian equivalent, intermediate track. 
6.3.3.2.  AFFOR AFSSC, senior track, select O-5s and civilian equivalents. 
6.3.3.3.  Contingency Wartime Planning Course, intermediate track for A-staff A4 and 
designated A2/6C, A3 and A5 personnel, and for general planners. 
6.3.3.4.  Joint Air Operations Planning Course, for A-staff A5 and designated A2/6C and 
A3 personnel, and for general planners. 
6.3.3.5.  USAF Steady-State Campaign Support Planning Course, intermediate track 
required for OPG and long range planning group members as well as all theater security 
cooperation planners, foreign area officers, political-military affairs strategists, and 
international health specialists.  Users have the option of taking this on-line course on 
platforms listed above. 
6.3.3.6.  Command & Control Warrior Advanced Course, lead planners. 
6.3.3.7.  ICT is mandatory for ARC aligned personnel to ensure units are trained to 
integrate with an AF component headquarters.  ARC personnel will complete one of the 
in-residence courses listed above.  (T-3).  Based on the members’ previous experience, 
this requirement may be waived by the unit commander. 
6.3.3.8.  ICT timeline.  ICT should be initiated not later than 45 days from date assigned 
to an air component staff position.  Ensure ICT is completed within 180 days of 
assignment for RegAF and 365 days for ARC. 
6.3.3.9.  Based on the members’ previous experience, individuals may be proficiency 
advanced by the first O-6 in the members’ chain in command.  NOTE: Refer to 
Attachment 2 for a list of AFFOR Staff Education and Training Courses. 
50 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
6.3.4.  Mission Certification Training (MCT). 
6.3.4.1.  Definition.  MCT is theater-specific training or functional training designed to 
prepare the air component staff to accomplish air component assigned missions.  In 
addition, MCT provides training in those processes and functions identified in Chapter 4 
of this AFI.  Air component OPRs listed in paragraph 6.1.2 are responsible for the C-
MAJCOM/C-NAF mission certification-training program.  NGB and AFR are offices of 
primary responsibility for ARC training. 
6.3.4.2.  MCT may involve tailored training and on-the-job training with applicable 
SMEs, classroom academics, self-study, and practice as necessary. 
6.3.4.3.  For designated personnel assigned to theater security cooperation and/or steady-
state campaign support planning duties in the intermediate track, to include foreign area 
officers, politico-military affairs strategists, and international health specialists, complete 
the USAF Steady State Campaign Support Planning Course.  Users have the option of 
taking this on-line course on the ADLS, Joint Knowledge Online, Blackboard® or other 
training platform. 
6.3.4.4.  Mission Certification Training Timeline. 
6.3.4.4.1.  Start MCT for Active Component not later than 45 days from ICT 
completion.  Complete MCT within 180 days of start of MCT. 
6.3.4.4.2.  Start MCT for ARC not later than 90 days after ICT and ensure completion 
not later than 365 days after training start.  MCT may be completed concurrently with 
ICT. 
6.3.4.4.3.  Theater specific training should also include an exercise as part of MCT. 
6.3.4.4.4.  MCT is complete when all unit training requirements are met.  Note: 
Officer and enlisted members are eligible for award of the USAF operations staff 
planner special experience identifier after completion of Contingency Wartime 
Planning Course, Joint Air Operations Planners Course, and Joint Air Operations 
Course with AF/A3OD approval and the Air Force Officer Classification Directory 
officer experience sets list.  Consideration for the award will also be made for 
graduates of the School of Advanced Military Studies, the School of Advanced 
Warfighting, the Maritime Advanced Warfighting School, or the Multi-Domain 
Command and Control Course.  (T-1). 
6.3.5.  Continuation Training. 
6.3.5.1.  Definition.  Continuation training provides the air component staff with the mix 
of training necessary to maintain proficiency in assigned staff positions.  Continuation 
training begins after the member is certified in an air component staff position. 
6.3.5.2.  Continuation training accomplishes two purposes: maintaining air component 
staff certification (MCT status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills.  
continuation training is the air component commander’s tool to ensure that the air 
component staff is prepared to support the CCDR and air component commander as 
required at all times. 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
51 
6.3.5.3.  AFFOR staff and mission certified ARC personnel must participate in annual 
exercises.  (T-2).  This requirement may be met by participating in a real world 
mobilization or planning event in an AOC/OC or air component staff position or by 
attending an in-residence course listed in paragraph 6.3.3.2 through 6.3.3.4  Units may 
supplement this continuation training requirement. 
6.3.5.4.  Continuation training timeline. 
6.3.5.4.1.  Continuation training requirements should begin no later than 30 days after 
the individual is air component staff certified. 
6.3.5.4.2.  Additional continuation training requirements for air component staff is 
addressed in unit/MAJCOM supplement. 
6.3.5.4.3.  ARC units accomplish continuation training over a two-year period. 
6.3.6.  Training Exceptions. 
6.3.6.1.  Training Extension.  Parent MAJCOMs approve individual training extensions 
(in accordance with paragraph 6.2).  An O-6 in the chain of command or equivalent may 
grant a one-time 30-day extension (180 days for ARC units) for the extension.  If the unit 
level extension lapses, the commander or designated representative has three options: re-
enter the individual into training (restart the clock), re-assign the member to a non-
operational level staff function, or allow the individual to continue duties for 180 days 
and complete training requirements with a waiver requested through air component OPR 
for air component staff training. 
6.3.6.2.  Extension Methodology.  Based upon recommendation of the training manager 
and supervisor, the commander or designated representative may grant a one-time 
training extension (30 Active Component days/180 ARC days), allow the individual to 
continue duties with a waiver in accordance with waiver limits established in paragraph 
6.3.6.1, or take appropriate action to remove the individual from air component staff 
duties.  Maintain all waivers in the individual’s training record.  If no waiver is granted, 
the air component commander or designated representative may take appropriate action 
to remove the individual from the air component staff position.  Individuals with waivers 
subsequently assigned to other air components should be reevaluated for reentry into 
training or extension of that waiver within 30 days of arrival.  The commander or 
designated representative may direct a downgrade of an air component staff member’s 
training status if he/she deems circumstances warrant it.  The individual should then re-
enter the directed level of training with the same time requirements from that downgrade 
date.  Removal from air component staff duties may include coordinating reassignment 
within the air component to another duty position. 
6.4.  Training Documentation. 
 
 
52 
AFI13-103  19 NOVEMBER 2020 
6.4.1.  Air Component Staff Documentation.  Document all training and maintain training 
records to include the following milestones: date assigned station, upgrade training start and 
completion dates, ICT and MCT dates, completion date, MCT completion date, deployment 
dates and continuation training dates to include exercises, operations and formal school 
completion dates, and any other significant training dates.  AFFOR training will be 
documented on all officer, enlisted and civilian personnel.  (T-2).  ARC units maintain their 
own records. 
6.4.2.  Maintain a copy of all waivers in an individual’s training records. 
6.4.3.  Use the official memorandum format established in Air Force Handbook 33-337, 
Tongue and Quill for mandatory reporting. 
6.5.  MAJCOM OPR Reportable Items. 
6.5.1.  ICT timeline exceeded (including extensions).  Training Managers will report all 
actions taken quarterly.  (T-2). 
6.5.2.  MCT failure to progress.  Training Managers must provide MAJCOM OPRs the 
report quarterly.  (T-2). 
6.5.3.  Training limiting factors and shortfalls to include continuation training: Training 
Managers report limiting factors and shortfalls annually.

Terms 
Agile—The ability to rapidly deploy, employ, sustain, and redeploy capabilities in 
geographically separated and environmentally diverse regions. 
Air Advisors—Air advisors work with partner nations to develop their aviation enterprises using 
the skills they already have as an Airman.  Air advisors are trained to do five core functions: 
assess, train, advise, assist and equip a partner nation’s air component. 
Area Air Defense Commander—Within a unified command, subordinate unified command, or 
joint task force, the commander assigns overall responsibility for air defense to a single 
commander.  Normally, this should be the component commander with the preponderance of air 
defense capability and the command, control, and communications capability to plan and execute 
integrated air defense operations.  Representation from the other components involved are 
provided, as appropriate, to the area air defense commander’s headquarters. 
Coalition—An ad hoc arrangement between two or more nations for common action. 
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated 
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.  C2 
functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, 
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and 
controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. 
Commander, Air Force Forces—The single Air Force commander of an Air Force Service
