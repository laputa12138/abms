Chapter 1 
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) DEFENSE 
OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY 
1.1.  Purpose.  This publication implements the DAF CBRN Defense Program and its 
responsibilities, procedures, and standards for organizing, training, and equipping forces to 
prevent, protect against, prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from adversarial use of 
CBRN weapons/materials to effectively preserve force survivability and mission continuation. 
Refer to DAFI 10-2501 for guidance on CBRN preparedness and response to terrorist use of CBRN 
weapons/materials and other continental United States (CONUS)-specific CBRN response and 
preparedness requirements. Additionally, this publication establishes cross-functional concepts, 
policy, standards, and actions to organize, train, and equip (OT&E) combat, combat support, and 
combat service support forces to survive and operate in and through CBRN contested 
environments. Primary policy objectives are to: 
1.1.1.  Set conditions to synchronize, integrate, and align related Department of Defense 
(DoD), joint and DAF CBRN defense doctrine and DoD/DAF instructions/manuals 
summarized in Chapter 1. 
1.1.2.  Synchronize this publication and AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical, 
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Environment. Guidance on synchronization is 
provided in Joint Publication 3-11, Operations in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and 
Nuclear Environments under the joint CBRN defense planning standards/mission areas. Note:  
AFMAN 10-2503 provides guidance for conducting and sustaining operations in contested and 
degraded environments under CBRN conditions. 
1.1.3.  Support operational imperatives to operationally-optimize information, generate 
resilient installations, and account for combat support maneuver aspects needed to protect 
forces from CBRN effects and continue mission operations. 
1.1.4.  Institutionalize CBRN defense fundamentals across the DAF to restore individual and 
unit CBRN defense preparedness to maintain the capabilities required to survive and operate 
in and through CBRN contested environments. This includes preparing and posturing forces 
during the Air Force Forces Generation (AFFORGEN) process and incorporating CBRN 
defense into ACE training, exercises, and operations. 
1.1.5.  Support integrated deterrence by demonstrating DAF readiness to operate in and 
through CBRN contested environments. 
1.2.  Situation.  Global CBRN effects to DAF personnel and OLs will continue to create 
substantial risk to DAF strategic, operational, and tactical capabilities in support of combatant 
command (CCMD) missions. 
1.3.  Mission.  The DAF will OT&E its forces to deter weapons of mass destruction (WMD) actors 
of concern and minimize the effects of adversary WMD attacks on its operations IAW AFPD 10-
26. Note:  CBRN defense is a subcomponent of countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) 
and helps to preserve force survivability and mission continuation. 
1.4.  Operational Environment (OE) Applicability.  CBRN defense is foundational to DAF 
global operations. For this reason, the DAF CBRN Defense Program structure and functioning will 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
9 
account for DAF warfighting operational contributions within the global operating model to 1) 
defend the homeland; 2) build partnership capacity through contact; and 3) support joint force 
blunt and surge operations. Ally and partner capability to function alongside USAF ongoing 
operations under CBRN conditions requires preparation of partner forces during contact layer 
activities (i.e., security cooperation, security force assistance [SFA], etc.). DAF CBRN Defense 
Programs at all echelons will integrate preparedness standards for combat operations under CBRN 
conditions. 
1.5.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Threat Overview.  The primary 
CBRN threats to DAF and joint operations and forces include nation state attacks with nuclear 
weapons, chemical and/or biological warfare agents, and the threat of the use of those weapons. 
This includes both overt and covert attacks with current or novel agents. Adversaries will continue 
to employ information operations in conjunction with CBRN events.  Additionally, state and non-
state actors are capable of employing CBRN materials, including toxic industrial materials (TIM) 
to disrupt DAF and/or joint operations and cause casualties. The loss of control or theft of CBRN 
materials, TIMs, and other WMD materials constitutes a significant threat to the joint force, as can 
naturally occurring phenomena such as pandemic influenza and infectious disease. The deadly, 
destructive, and disruptive effects of these weapons, materials, and phenomena merit continuous 
consideration by the commanders at all levels. 
1.5.1.  DAF commanders utilize the joint intelligence preparation of the operating environment 
(JIPOE) process to assess CBRN threats. A byproduct of the JIPOE process is a comprehensive 
WMD threat assessment developed at the CCMD echelon. Component-major command (C-
MAJCOM) Air Force Forces (AFFOR) and Air Operations Center (AOC) staff must gain 
access to and review their respective CCMD WMD Threat Assessment to ensure command 
operations, activities, and investments (OAI) result in an air component that is threat informed 
and organized, trained, and equipped to operate in a CBRN-contested environment. (T-2) 
Note:  C-MAJCOM AFFOR and AOC staff must ensure subordinate and supporting 
commanders obtain shared situational awareness regarding the WMD threat. (T-2) 
1.5.2.  According to the 2023 Annual Threat Assessment of the United States (U.S.) 
Intelligence Community, and unclassified threat reports from the Defense Intelligence Agency, 
https://www.dia.mil/Military-Power-Publications/, the People’s Republic of China, Russia, 
North Korea, and Iran either have or are pursuing WMD programs including CBRN 
weapons/materials. Refer to the Defense Intelligence Agency for additional information. 
1.5.2.1.  Potential U.S. adversaries are acquiring a larger number of more capable aircraft 
and missiles, making U.S. air bases increasingly vulnerable to physical attack by a wider 
array of delivery platforms. Air and missile attacks along with cyber, electronic warfare, 
antisatellite, and asymmetric (e.g., WMD) capabilities also threaten the communication 
systems that the joint force uses to command and control (C2) air operations. 
1.5.2.2.  CBRN weapons/materials can be delivered overtly by various delivery systems 
(e.g., missiles, rockets, artillery, aircraft, mines, and torpedoes). Other delivery systems 
(e.g., dirty bombs, radiological dispersal devices, or the use of CBRN materials against 
potential friendly targets, such as the food, water, and supply systems or postal systems) 
could be used for covert employment. 
1.5.2.3.  State actor(s) doctrine for CBRN use against U.S. forces may vary; however, an 
adversary would likely use CBRN weapons to impact the terrain, the force, or a 
10 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
combination of both. Airbases are vital to U.S. power projection which makes them an 
attractive target for CBRN weapons. 
1.6.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Hazards.  CBRN hazards are 
CBRN materials that could create adverse effects if released or disseminated accidentally, 
deliberately, or even naturally. They include TIMs (including toxic industrial chemicals [TIC], 
toxic industrial biologicals, and toxic industrial radiological materials), chemical and biological 
agents, biological pathogens that result in the spread of infectious disease, radioactive materials, 
and nuclear hazards. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for an overview of CBRN threat and hazard effects 
on DAF operations. 
1.7.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Incident.  A CBRN incident is 
any occurrence involving the emergence of CBRN hazards resulting from the use of CBRN 
weapons or devices; the emergence of secondary hazards due to counterforce targeting or other 
friendly force action; or any other occurrence that causes the release of TIMs (including TICs, 
toxic industrial biologicals, and toxic industrial radiological materials) into the OE. 
1.8.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense.  CBRN defense is the 
employment of aircrew CBRN (ACBRN), medical CBRN, and non-medical CBRN defense 
capabilities that counter the entire range of CBRN hazards. DAF commanders employ CBRN 
defense capabilities (e.g., integration of individual protective equipment [IPE] and other 
equipment to protect against CBRN effects or demonstrating to an adversary that warfighters are 
trained) in support of Joint Force Commander objectives to reduce or negate vulnerabilities and 
minimize the effects of CBRN contamination.

leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) spectrum, that 
counter the entire range of adversarial CBRN effects on DAF operations. 
1.9.4.1.  DAF commanders will use this publication to effectively organize, train, equip, 
and resource DAF personnel to obtain and maintain preparedness for CBRN warfare. (T-2) 
Note:  unless otherwise specified, the use of “DAF commander” throughout this 
publication implies that the requirement applies to both USAF and USSF commanders 
where applicable. 
1.9.4.2.  AFMAN 10-2503 contains more specific and technical information and is 
intended to articulate procedures for conducting CBRN defense during combat and 
contingency operations. DAF commanders tasked with CBRN defense responsibilities in 
this publication will use AFMAN 10-2503 to prevent, protect against, prepare for, mitigate, 
respond to, and recover from adversarial use of CBRN weapons/materials on OL. (T-2) 
1.9.4.3.  CBRN defense is an inherently complex joint activity requiring a high degree of 
technical competency to preserve force survivability and mission continuation. DAF 
commanders, including their CBRN defense staff (refer to Chapter 5 for CBRN defense 
staff details), will ensure DAF personnel use the Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and 
Procedures (AFTTP) listed in Attachment 3 when planning and preparing for CBRN

DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
1.10.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Doctrine. 
1.10.1.  Joint Publication 3-11 states the Joint Force Commander, and supporting commanders, 
train for and remain prepared to conduct the range of military operations through an OE 
impacted by CBRN weapons or materials. 
1.10.2.  Air Force doctrine publication (AFDP) 3-40, Counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Operations, states Airmen and Guardians should be trained to plan operations in a distributed 
or decentralized manner and execute the mission when isolated from higher echelons in 
distributed environments and environments degraded by the effects of attacks with WMD. 
Airmen and Guardians at all levels should be capable of making decisions independently, 
operating based on commander’s intent and the principles of mission command, even in 
conditions degraded and contaminated by WMD attacks. 
1.10.2.1.  The major commands (MAJCOM)/field commands (FLDCOM) Commanders 
must safeguard the force and manage the consequences of WMD activities through combat 
support, force protection, force health protection (FHP), homeland defense, and security 
cooperation. 
1.10.2.2.  Combat support includes fielding forces capable to survive and operate in a 
CBRN-contested environment; posturing forces in CBRN threat environments; protecting 
forces from CBRN weapons; generating the mission in CBRN-contested environments; 
and supporting and sustaining the mission, forces, and infrastructure in CBRN threat 
environments. 
1.10.2.3.  Force protection includes the DAF EM Program; CBRN defense training, 
exercises, and inspections; CBRN support to command and control (CSC2); first and 
emergency response operations; and specialized support/recovery teams (i.e., explosive 
ordnance disposal [EOD], rapid airfield damage repair, etc.). 
1.10.2.4.  FHP includes medical treatment and care as part of an all-hazards approach; 
aeromedical evacuation from CBRNE-contaminated environments; and medical stability 
operations (includes medical CBRN threat response). 
1.10.2.5.  Defense support to civil authorities and homeland defense. 
1.10.2.6.  Security cooperation includes CBRN defense relationships and foreign 
consequence management. 
1.10.3.  Joint Publication 3-11 provides joint doctrine describing the CBRN environment in a 
strategic context; provides necessary strategic and operational considerations; and describes 
CBRN defense activities and tasks applicable to joint operations. 
1.10.4.  Joint Publication 3-40, Joint Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, provides joint 
doctrine describing the WMD activity continuum, operational framework for countering 
WMD, organizing principles, specialized activities and tasks, and the role of the functional 
campaign plan for countering WMD. 
1.11.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Contested Operational 
Environment (OE).  A CBRN-contested OE include CBRN threats/hazards present and their 
potential effects on operations at OLs (e.g., installation, main operating bases [MOB], forward 
operating sites [FOS], cooperative security locations [CSL], or contingency locations [CL]). Refer 
to AF doctrine note (AFDN) 1-21, Agile Combat Employment, for additional information on OL 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
13 
terms. Additionally, DAF forces may be exposed to CBRN hazards when accomplishing missions 
away from an OL. 
1.12.  Assumptions.  The following greatest hazard/threat effect assumptions will guide strategic, 
operational, and tactical DAF CBRN Defense Program concepts; tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTP); organize, train/exercise, and equip requirements; and shape overarching 
deliberate to adaptive planning and risk management activities. 
1.12.1.  Strategic. The functions of the DAF, as specified in DoDD 5100.01, Functions of the 
Department of Defense and Its Major Components, (e.g., global strike, precision attack, global 
mobility, space operations, C2, agile combat support, etc.) are interdependent and mutually 
susceptible to degrading CBRN effects. Global CBRN threat information guides DAF wide 
preparation of forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war under CBRN conditions. 
1.12.2.  Operational. All MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs are susceptible to degrading CBRN effects. 
The DAF CBRN Defense Program generates shared battle space awareness along the C2 
continuum and enables AFFOR to generate and employ in and through a CBRN-contested 
environment. 
1.12.3.  Tactical. No DAF OL is a sanctuary from CBRN effects. No OL has sufficient 
resources, capabilities, and/or capacity to prevent, protect, prepare, mitigate, respond to, and 
recover on its own from the greatest CBRN hazards/threats. Reliance on mission partners and 
varying schemes of maneuver (i.e., avoidance, dispersal, return to operate, etc.) is essential to 
enable force survivability and mission continuation. Speed and timing of the conflict 
continuum, including adversarial fires and effects, requires the ability to quickly execute 
CBRN defense tasks to mitigate enemy CBRN fires and effects.

annually with all applicable HHQ and subordinate level CBRN defense area, zone, 
collection, and/or sub-collection centers. 
2.18.6.3.  AEW commanders planned to execute ACE (maneuver/dispersal operations) 
must evaluate both the virtual and physical (manual) CBRN warning, reporting and hazard 
prediction capability between the MOB, FOS, CSL, CL and/or other applicable OLs during 
a CBRN defense exercise and ensure that CBRN warning systems integrate with ally and 
partner force systems integrate with ally and partner force systems as required of the OL. 
2.18.7.  Ensure individuals performing inherently CBRN defense related duties and 
responsibilities (i.e., installation emergency manager/planner, CBRN defense specialists 
[AFSC 3E9X1], etc.) obtain and maintain an adjudicated Top Secret level clearance and be 
eligible for Special Compartmented Information clearance, where applicable. Appropriate 
access is required to effectively understand and assess CBRN threats in real time. 
2.18.8.  Ensure the IOEM develops a criticality, hazard, vulnerability, and capability 
assessment through the Integrated Risk Management Process IAW DAFI 10-2501. AEW 
commanders will use these assessments to identify and prioritize CBRN defense risks. Note:  
Refer to the applicable SCG when developing these assessments. 
2.18.8.1.  Commanders must develop and document risk mitigation strategies for all 
identified CBRN defense mission risks.

2.18.11.  Through the CBRN defense staff, review the alarm signals listed in AFTTP 3-2.46, 
Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, 
and Nuclear Passive Defense, and obtain the DAF attack warning signals and mission-oriented 
protective postures (MOPP) visual aids through the DAF Be Ready Campaign centrally 
managed by AFIMSC. Once obtained, tailor the attack warning to the most dangerous enemy 
COAs then implement, integrate, and evaluate the use of attack warning signals and MOPP 
levels during CBRN defense exercises. 
2.18.12.  Through the CBRN defense staff, divide the MOB into CBRN defense sectors on 
base grid maps and/or within the digital common operating environment. Consider aligning 
the CBRN defense sectors to any force protection sectors already established. Sectoring the 
MOB provides flexibility, through mission command, in CBRN defense preparations, response

respond to, and recover from CBRN incidents affecting CCMD and/or MAJCOM/FLDCOM 
identified mission-critical systems and infrastructure required to survive and/or operate in a 
CBRN-contested environment. 
3.4.2.  To the maximum extent practical, DAF commanders at all levels must ensure 
individuals and mission critical systems can conduct and sustain operations in CBRN-
contested environments in the theater during combat operations. 
3.4.3.  AEW commanders at OCONUS OLs with mission-critical systems must ensure 
emergency essential personnel are adequately protected to enable execution of mission-critical 
tasks in a CBRN-contested environment. CBRN survivability TTPs will be documented in a 
site-specific plan developed for each mission-critical system. 
3.4.3.1.  AEW commanders at OCONUS OLs will plan to provide individual CBRN 
protection for emergency essential personnel. (T-2) Where hazardous material 
(TICs/TIMs) threats exist, commanders will establish a SIP and evacuation program. (T-3) 
3.4.3.2.  AEW commanders at OCONUS OLs will provide a CBRN emergency response 
capability in support of CBRN mission-critical systems. (T-2) Commanders should 
consider the availability and capacity of on/off base emergency response capabilities to

3.6.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, 
and Nuclear (CBRN) Threat Planning 
Assumptions.  This section establishes planning assumptions to characterize the CBRN threat and 
associated OE from a tactical echelon level perspective. DAF commanders will consider these 
planning assumptions when developing CBRN response COAs when planning for distributed 
operations. These assumptions are derived from JP 3-11, AFMAN 10-2503, and various technical 
reports developed by AF/A10S and available through the Defense Technical Information Center. 
3.6.1.  An enemy order of battle would include both conventional and asymmetric capabilities 
delivered by a wide variety of platforms/systems. As a result, the enemy’s range to target would 
reduce the amount of warning time available. 
3.6.2.  Adversarial use of certain biological warfare agents prior to the start of conflict would 
significantly degrade force survivability as the onset of symptoms would begin appearing 
during the early hours/days of conflict. 
3.6.3.  An adversary would likely use conventional weapons to target centers of gravity (e.g., 
airfield, runways, fuel depot, C2 nodes, and/or maintenance/munition production facilities) 
throughout a regional cluster followed by a targeted CBRN attack. 
3.6.4.  Enemy mass fires/effects would significantly degrade communication capabilities 
dependent on existing physical infrastructure, lines of communication, and/or standard 
operating procedures designed for permissive operations.

3.6.5.  An adversary would employ persistent, nonpersistent, or a combination of both types of 
CWA to degrade force survivability and mission continuation. 
3.6.6.  An adversary would most likely target an OL with an air bursting nuclear weapon. 
Nuclear effects (e.g., nuclear fallout) from surface or sub-surface attacks on nearby locations 
is also a threat. 
3.7.  Air Component Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Threat 
Overview.  C-MAJCOM and subordinate commanders should rely on their respective CCMD 
WMD Threat Assessment to guide command CBRN defense OT&E activities. However, DAFI 
10-2501 provides a CBRN Risk Index tool C-MAJCOM and subordinate commanders will use 
when a CCMD WMD Threat Assessment is not available. (T-2) 
3.7.1.  DAFI 10-2501 introduces the installation tactical EM program execution requirements 
(TEMPER) to inform and shape advanced EM and CBRN defense capabilities. This 
publication adopts TEMPER from DAFI 10-2501 and uses it to characterize the CBRN threats 
to the air component and associated risk index as listed in Table 3.3. 
3.7.2.  DAF commanders will reference Table 3.3 and apply the installation TEMPER to 
inform how AFFORGEN FEs are organized, trained, and equipped to execute distributed 
operations in a CBRN-contested environment. Note:  Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for additional 
information on using the installation TEMPER.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) SUPPORT 
TO COMMAND AND CONTROL (CSC2) 
4.1.  Overview.  CSC2 provides DAF commanders with the capabilities required to understand 
and assess CBRN threats and effects in real-time. CSC2 assists the DAF commander in identifying 
those critical CBRN-related objectives and the operational end state so the commander can 
visualize the sequence of events in each COA that moves the force from its current state to the 
envisioned state. It also provides the ability to: 
4.1.1.  Report all CBRN attacks and resulting contamination. 
4.1.2.  Predict and warn of hazard areas from CBRN incidents. 
4.1.3.  Contribute to the evaluation of CBRN information to gain decision advantage. 
4.1.4.  Informs friendly force capabilities and an integrated warning capability for inbound 
threats. 
4.1.5.  Transmits advanced hazard warning of a potential CBRN agent/material. 
4.1.6.  Enables the interchange of CBRN reports with mission command partners, including 
co-located ally and partner leadership/forces. 
4.1.7.  Transmit processed sensor data from the lower tactical internet to the upper tactical 
internet or service equivalent, between unclassified to classified systems, utilizing service 
provided cross domain solutions. 
4.2.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Support to Command and 
Control (CSC2) Systems.  CSC2 systems must be resilient to physical, cyber, and electro-
magnetic spectrum threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data; have a near 
real-time update and refresh capability; and maintain the ability to detect, identify, and track 
CBRN threats to support the Advanced Battle Management System attribute of advanced sensing. 
(T-2) 
4.2.1.  DAF communication networks, by which, CSC2 information will be passed and posted 
to the DAF and Joint Service C2 common operating pictures (e.g., CBRN-Information System 
[CBRN-IS], Global Command and Control System [GCCS]/GCCS-Korea/GCCS-
Japan/GCCS-Europe) must be designated CBRN mission critical. (T-2) 
4.2.2.  CBRN-IS (including Joint Warning and Reporting Network [JWARN] and Joint Effects 
Module [JEM]) must be sustained throughout combat operations to ensure integrated early 
warning and joint all domain C2 objectives are accomplished for CBRN defense reporting and 
warning requirements. (T-2) 
4.3.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Support to Command and 
Control (CSC2) Enabling Tasks.  AEW commanders at OCONUS OLs will establish CSC2 
system capabilities that meet the minimum enabling tasks listed in Table 4.1. 
Table 4.1.  Support to Command and Control (CSC2) Enabling Tasks. 
Communicate information to maintain or restore C2 over ground and airborne systems. (T-2) 
42 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
Communicate information to maintain or restore primary mission capability. (T-2) 
Communicate information to provide support to joint service, coalition, and host nation forces. 
(T-2) 
Communicate information to direct alarm conditions and MOPP levels. (T-2) 
Communicate information to warn joint service, coalition, and host nation forces of CBRN 
hazards. (T-2) 
Communicate information to implement pre-, trans-, and post-attack activities. (T-2) 
Communicate information to survive attacks and restore operations. (T-2) 
Communicate information required to support non-combatant evacuation order operations. 
(T-2) 
Communicate information required to support CBRN warning and reporting. (T-2) 
Communicate information required for contamination avoidance and dispersal. (T-2) 
Communicate information required for blackout procedures; hardening; and camouflage, 
concealment, and deception activities. (T-2) 
Communicate information required for personnel and resource accountability. (T-2) 
Communicate information required to deploy and employ CBRN defense specialists and 
support teams. (T-2) 
4.4.  Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) Support to Command and Control (CSC2) and Mission 
Command.  The Airman’s philosophy for the C2 of airpower is mission command. Mission 
command is an approach to C2 that empowers subordinate decision-making for flexibility, 
initiative, and responsiveness in the accomplishment of commander’s intent IAW AFDP 1. AEW 
commanders use the mission command philosophy to C2 personnel under their command for 
operations in a CBRN-contested environment. 
4.5.  Crisis Action Team (CAT).  The CAT is the top echelon of airbase CBRN defense 
operations and is led by the AEW commander from the Expeditionary Air Base. The primary focus 
of the CAT is force survivability and mission continuation. 
4.5.1.  The CAT typically includes commanders and senior enlisted leaders from the 
AFFORGEN FEs. Members of joint, coalition, and/or partner nation may also be present. The 
CAT supports the AEW commander by assessing the situation, determining mission priorities 
and defensive actions, and directing subordinate units. 
4.5.2.  Effective CBRN defense operations require a team effort since most CBRN defense 
countermeasures and response actions have far-reaching impact on mission accomplishment 
and sustainment. The direction provided by the AEW commander and staff integrates actions 
of all warfighting functions across the OL. This integration requires direct input and feedback 
from other C2 centers (i.e., WOC, EOC, etc.) Refer to Table 4.2 for CAT CBRN defense 
enabling tasks. 
Table 4.2.  Crisis Action Team (CAT) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
(CBRN) Defense Enabling Tasks. 
CAT CBRN Defense Enabling Tasks

Provide support to joint, coalition, and/or host nation forces. 
7 
Direct OL alarm conditions and MOPP levels. 
8 
Provide attack warning to joint, coalition, and/or host nation forces. 
4.6.  Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  AEW commanders at MOBs and semi-permanent 
CLs OCONUS will establish an EOC capability IAW DAFI 10-2501 to oversee and manage 
CBRN defense activities before, during, and after CBRN response operations. AEW commanders 
at other OCONUS OLs (e.g., FOS, CSL) can request and employ the EM C2 manpower (4FPWC) 
and equipment (4F9WC) UTCs, to provide an expeditionary EOC capability to support ACE 
schemes of maneuver. Note:  The EM C2 UTCs may only be available as a CET. 
4.6.1.  Refer to UFC 4-141-04 when designing EOCs as new military construction. (T-3) Note:   
At OCONUS OLs, survivability and resiliency from enemy mass conventional and asymmetric 
fires/effects is the most important design consideration. 
4.6.2.  Design EOC C2 processes to allow individuals and functions flexibility to shift 
decisively from one incident or objective to another. (T-3) The EOC must have the capability 
to process and integrate information in real-time before, during, and after CBRN response 
operations to produce coherent CBRN defense COAs or modifications to existing ones 
enabling decision advantage. (T-3) 
4.6.3.  The EOC C2 capability may be virtual or physically located and integrated with other 
OL C2 systems and processes. AEW commanders should leverage mission command and task 
orders to the greatest extent possible for CSC2. 
4.7.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Control Center.  AEW 
commanders OCONUS will establish a CBRN Control Center capability, operated by the CBRN 
defense staff, to enable CSC2 for each OL. (T-2) IAW North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) standards and AFTTP 3-2.56, the CBRN Control Center serves as a CBRN Sub 
Collection Center providing information enabling commanders to make risk management 
decisions and to warn of CBRN hazards. 
4.7.1.  CBRN defense specialists will manage and execute the CBRN Control Center 
capabilities. (T-2) The CBRN Control Center will use all sources of information (i.e., open 
source, CBRN sensor data, non-CBRN data, plume modeling, etc.) and intelligence to provide 
the needed battlespace awareness and understanding to maintain freedom of action and 
decision advantage in a CBRN environment. (T-2) 
4.7.2.  The CBRN Control Center will follow AFTTP 3-2.56 and ATP 45, Warning and 
Reporting and Hazard Prediction of CBRN Incidents (where applicable), to ensure CSC2 
capabilities are standardized across the DAF. (T-2) 
4.7.3.  The CBRN Control Center must have redundant and secure capabilities to transmit 
information to each supported and supporting echelon. (T-2) This includes receiving and 
transmitting information from CBRN defense specialists at one or more OLs. 
4.7.4.  The CBRN Control Center will coordinate with mission planners to provide mitigation 
recommendations for potential CBRN threats to force survivability and mission continuation. 
(T-2) 
44 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
4.7.5.  The CBRN Control Center will maintain the capability to conduct its responsibilities 
using electronic capabilities (e.g., JWARN and JEM) in a permissive environment and the 
ability to execute in an electronically denied or contested environment under ACE at a given 
OL. (T-2) 
4.7.6.  CBRN defense specialists postured to 4FPWC UTC and required to perform CBRN 
Control Center duties at any echelon must attend the CBRN C2 training course (JCACP3E971 
0A1A) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, to obtain initial training certification and then attend 
the CBRN-IS training course offered by AFIMSC or the JPEO-CBDP to obtain currency. (T-2) 
Additionally, CBRN defense specialists must obtain and maintain training currency on new 
capabilities introduced to the CBRN Control Center. (T-3) 
4.7.7.  The CBRN Control Center may include augmentees, host nation and/or joint/coalition 
personnel as part of the CBRN defense staff. (T-3). AEW commanders OCONUS should 
consider coordinating localized CBRN Control Center training for host national or 
joint/coalition personnel. (T-3) 
4.7.8.  The CBRN Control Center will be organized, trained, equipped, and operated IAW ATP 
45, AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP), AFTTP 3-2.56, and AFTTP 3-2.70. 
4.7.8.1.  An OPREP is required IAW AFMAN 10-206 to provide the information 
necessary for timely operational decisions in support of C2 for aerospace forces. CBRN 
defense specialists must remain in close coordination with command post personnel to 
support OPREP during CBRN incidents. 
4.7.8.2.  CSC2, including warning and reporting activities of CBRN information, provides 
AEW commanders with essential information required to execute CBRN defense 
protection measures to preserve force survivability and mission continuation. 
4.7.9.  AEW commanders OCONUS should plan for providing an expeditionary CBRN 
Control Center capability at each FOS and/or CSL/CL. Submit a Request for Forces for the 
4FPWC UTC when assigned forces are inadequate to effectively plan for and execute CBRN 
Control Center operations. (T-2) 
4.8.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Information System (CBRN-
IS).  CBRN defense staff will analyze the CBRN threat assessment developed during the JIPOE 
process and use the CBRN-IS to develop most dangerous and most likely CBRN effects models 
for each potential OL. (T-2) 
4.8.1.  AFIMSC maintains an operational analysis and integration section. This section 
publishes CBRN defense related information obtained from open source and publicly available 
information in a read book format for command teams through the Installation Emergency 
Manager (IEM). The IEM must share the CBRN defense read book as “INFO ONLY” with 
senior leaders and command teams to provide a shared understanding of the OE in real-time. 
(T-3) 
4.8.2.  AEW commanders OCONUS will use the CBRN threat assessment, time event 
matrices, and effects models developed through the JIPOE process to establish and tailor alarm 
conditions and MOPP levels for each OL. (T-2) AEW commanders must establish and publish 
authorities for changing alarm conditions and MOPP levels. (T-3) All AEW commanders must 
assume adversarial employment of CBRN weapons could occur with little to no warning. (T-2) 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
45 
4.8.2.1.  AEW commanders OCONUS will adopt and implement attack warning signals, 
alarm conditions and MOPP levels listed in AFMAN 10-2503, and the related visual aids 
procured through the DAF Be Ready Program IAW DAFI 10-2501. Commanders may 
elect to tailor the attack warning signals, alarm conditions and MOPP levels based on 
CBRN threat assessment, time event matrices, and effects models developed through the 
JIPOE process. (T-3) Regardless of warning and notification products utilized, AEW 
commanders must assume that an attack could occur with little to no notice and be prepared 
to effectively warn personnel in a manner that best preserves force survivability and 
mission continuation. 
4.8.2.1.1.  Attack Warning Signals. AEW commanders OCONUS use DAF 
standardized warning signals to posture OLs for attacks, warn of attacks in progress, 
initiate post-attack recovery actions, and return the OL to the required state of 
readiness. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for additional information. 
4.8.2.1.2.  Alarm Conditions. AEW commanders OCONUS declare alarm conditions 
to initiate passive defense actions in wartime. Alarm conditions, combined with 
supplemental instructions through the chain of command, are the most effective way to 
establish the defense posture of an OL. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for additional 
information. 
4.8.2.1.3.  MOPP Levels. MOPP levels are protection options allowing the commander 
to balance protection requirements and performance degradation with mission 
requirements. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for additional information. 
4.8.2.2.  AEW commanders at MOBs OCONUS will enhance force survivability and 
mission continuation by planning to disperse CSC2 capabilities within defined OLs. (T-3) 
Each FOS and/or CSL/CL may have an individual C2 capability to communicate with a 
centralized MOB C2 node, but, at a minimum, each OL must also maintain the ability to 
communicate alarm conditions and MOPP levels independently from the MOB to all 
individuals at the OL. (T-3) 
4.8.2.3.  AEW commanders OCONUS with CBRN Collection and Sub Collection Centers 
at OLs will conduct a biannual test, or more frequently IAW command policy, of the CSC2 
capability including testing attack warning signals, alarm conditions, and the ability to 
transmit CBRN reports using CBRN-IS at each applicable OL. (T-3). Commanders will 
test and evaluate the CSC2 capability under a simulated communication-denied 
environment during the CBRN defense exercise. (T-3) 
4.8.2.4.  AEW commanders OCONUS tasked to operate at FOSs and/or CSL/CL will plan 
for and exercise providing CSC2 capabilities in a communication-degraded environment. 
(T-3) The emphasis must be on providing CSC2 based on mission command and tasking 
orders thoroughly planned and exercised beforehand.

Chapter 5 
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) DEFENSE 
ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE 
5.1.  CBRN Defense Staff and Unit Organization. 
5.1.1.  CBRN defense staffs and units are organized into scalable, tailorable, and 
multifunctional configurations that can best support joint and DAF operations. The tailorable 
force increases the mission command and sustainment capability for AFFORGEN FEs and is 
responsive to and aligned with Wings, C-NAF, and C-MAJCOMs. Note:  Other DAF 
organizations may also have a requirement for a CBRN defense staff. 
5.1.1.1.  The primary CBRN defense staff includes the following AFSCs: 
5.1.1.1.1.  AFSC 1N0X1, All Source Intelligence Analyst. 
5.1.1.1.2.  AFSC 1P0X1, AFE. 
5.1.1.1.3.  AFSC 2G0X1, Logistics Plans. 
5.1.1.1.4.  AFSC 3E8X1, EOD. 
5.1.1.1.5.  AFSC 3E9X1, EM (DAF CBRN defense specialists). 
5.1.1.1.6.  AFSC 4B0X1, Bioenvironmental Engineering. 
5.1.1.1.7.  AFSC 4E0X1, Public Health. 
5.1.1.1.8.  AFSC 4N0X1, Aerospace Medical Service. 
5.1.1.2.  The expanded CBRN defense staff includes the following AFSCs: 
5.1.1.2.1.  AFSC 3E7X1, Fire Protection. 
5.1.1.2.2.  AFSC 3P0X1, Security Forces. 
5.1.1.2.3.  AFSC 3F1X1, Services. 
5.1.1.2.4.  Other AFSCs may be required to support CBRN defense planning and 
response activities. 
5.1.2.  CBRN defense staffs are limited in size and capacity across all echelons. CBRN defense 
operations are not the sole responsibility of the CBRN defense staff, but they must be integrated 
and executed across staff sections. When CBRN incidents occur, logistics, medical support, 
maintenance support, and every staff section is impacted and quickly overwhelmed if they are 
not prepared collectively to execute combat operations under CBRN conditions. 
5.1.3.  CBRN defense specialists (AFSC 3E9X1) are primarily tasked with CBRN hazard 
detection, identification, and quantification responsibilities. However, it is every DAF 
commander, command team, and supervisor’s responsibility to ensure that all assigned 
AFFORGEN FEs are trained and can execute functional tasks in a CBRN-contested 
environment. 
5.1.3.1.  CBRN defense specialists assigned to and/or postured for AFFORGEN must be 
able to provide the CBRN defense capabilities listed in Table 5.1. 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023

Conduct laboratory analysis to provide up to theater level identification. 
Ability to provide assess, train, advise, assist, and equip CBRN OAIs with ally and 
partner forces during security cooperation/SFA across the competition continuum. 
5.1.3.2.  CBRN defense specialists must have lightweight, agile, and expeditionary 
transportation capabilities certified for airworthiness to enable CBRN defense activities in 
support of ACE. (T-2) 
5.1.3.3.  Where practical, AEW commanders OCONUS must consider integrating 
unmanned robotic platforms and unmanned aerial vehicles into CBRN defense units to 
reduce the amount of time specialists are exposed to CBRN hazards. (T-2) 
5.1.3.4.  CBRN defense specialists must consider the role of ally and partner surface and 
air transportation capabilities during security cooperation and SFA OAIs to optimize 
resource availability during crisis and conflict. (T-2) Refer to AFPD 10-43, Air 
Advising/Security Force Assistance, and AFI 10-4301, Volume 3, Air Advising Operations, 
for additional information. 
5.2.  The CBRN defense staff must conduct CBRN defense planning as part of the integrated 
risk management process IAW DAFI 10-2501 and JP 3-11.  CBRN defense requirements, 
capabilities, vulnerabilities, shortfalls, gaps, and/or weaknesses must be processed through the 
installation Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG) and elevated to the C-
MAJCOM/FLDCOM EMWG or AFIMSC EMWG (for non-C-MAJCOMs) for intermediate 
command visibility, validation, and coordination. (T-2) 
5.3.  DAF CBRN defense staff process CBRN defense requirements, capabilities, 
vulnerabilities, shortfalls, gaps, and/or weaknesses through the DAF CBRN MWG, chaired

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) DEFENSE 
TRAINING 
6.1.  Overview.  DAF commanders have the responsibility to ensure the forces under their 
command are capable of surviving and operating in a CBRN-contested environment. Successful 
CBRN defense depends on a strong, up-to-date education, training, and exercise program for 
individuals (basic capability), additionally trained non-specialists with mission essential tasks 
(enhanced capability), and trained CBRN defense specialists (AFSC 3E9X1) allowing for a full 
detailed assessment of CBRN defense readiness. 
6.1.1.  JP 3-11, DoDI 3020.52, DAFI 10-2602, AFTTP 3-2.46 and ATP 3.8.1, Volume III 
provide guidance on establishing CBRN defense education, training, and exercise standards to 
effectively prepare the force to survive and operate in a CBRN-contested environment. DAF 
commanders will oversee the integration, synchronization, and coordination of CBRN defense 
training within the EM all-hazards approach. (T-1) Refer to DAFI 10-2501 for additional 
details. 
6.1.2.  CBRN defense training is command driven based on an evaluation of threats and risks 
during the integrated risk management process. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 and the integrated 
risks management process IAW DAFI 10-2501 to assess and evaluate the CBRN threat and 
associated risks to determine the level of training required. 
6.1.3.  The CBRN defense education, training, and exercise construct in support of 
AFFORGEN is depicted in Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2. 
Figure 6.1.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Education 
and Training Construct in support of Air Force Forces Generation (AFFORGEN).

Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Education, Training, and Exercises. 
 
6.2.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Education and 
Training Standards. 
6.2.1.  CBRN defense training is required to ensure Airmen, Guardians, mission-essential 
civilians, and contractors (as specified in the performance work statement) currently assigned 
to any OCONUS OL or tasked for OPLAN/Contingency Plan (CONPLAN) support at an 
OCONUS OL to obtain the proficiency required to survive and operate in a CBRN-contested 
environment. 
6.2.2.  CBRN defense capability levels correspond with the training proficiency standards 
required to adequately prepare the force. 
6.2.2.1.  Proficiency at the basic capability level (attending CBRN defense training) 
ensures individual survivability. 
6.2.2.2.  Proficiency at the enhanced capability level (i.e., completing CBRN TQT) ensures 
individuals and teams ability to operate in a CBRN-contested environment. 
6.2.2.3.  Proficiency at the specialized capability level ensures CBRN defense specialists 
and medical personnel are qualified to accomplish assigned missions. 
6.2.3.  DAF commanders and staff must be knowledgeable on and able to evaluate the effects 
CBRN weapons will have on operational efficiency. (T-2) DAF commanders and staff must 
complete the required CBRN defense training to obtain the knowledge and competence in 
CBRN defense beyond the scope of that demonstrated by individual personnel but not to the 
degree required by CBRN defense specialists. (T-2) DAF commanders, with the assistance of 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
51 
CBRN defense specialists, must be aware of hazards arising from CBRN incidents to plan and 
conduct operations under the influence of such hazards. (T-2) 
6.2.4.  All individuals postured for AFFORGEN are expected to become proficient in two basic 
types of CBRN defense skills:  basic CBRN survival skills and basic CBRN operating skills. 
On becoming aware of a CBRN hazard, every individual should be capable of taking those 
actions essential for immediate survival. In contrast, basic CBRN operating skills are those 
which the individual should master to contribute towards the continued operations of the unit 
under any CBRN threat conditions. Attending the CBRN defense education and training 
courses listed in paragraph 6.3 ensures DAF Airmen and Guardians obtain and maintain 
proficiency in both CBRN survival and operating skills. 
6.2.5.  C2 and mission generation FEs, including aircrew, must be trained to continue to 
execute their METs in a CBRN-contested environment. (T-2) 
6.3.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Education and 
Training Requirements.  DAF commanders must establish and facilitate education and training 
for CBRN defense preparedness activities to enable DAF personnel (military, civilians, and 
contractors) to obtain and maintain the competencies required to survive and operate in a CBRN-
contested environment. (T-0) The following paragraphs list the minimum CBRN defense related 
education and training requirements. Note:  CBRN defense education and training courses fall 
under the Ready Airman Training (RAT) Program. Refer to AFI 10-405, Ready Airman Training 
for additional details. 
6.3.1.  BEPO. Emergency managers will provide localized CBRN defense preparedness 
information to all newly assigned personnel, including civilians, contractors, and dependents 
during newcomers’ orientation IAW DAFI 10-2501. 
6.3.1.1.  Intelligence analysts at OCONUS OLs will incorporate an unclassified CBRN 
threat briefing into the BEPO. (T-3) 
6.3.1.2.  CBRN defense specialists at OCONUS OLs will incorporate an overview of 
localized attack warning signals, alarm conditions, MOPP levels, OL zones/sectors, and 
any shelter management procedures into the BEPO. (T-3) 
6.3.1.3.  Medical SMEs at OCONUS OLs will incorporate an overview of medical 
countermeasures and OEG into the BEPO. (T-3) 
6.3.2.  CBRN Defense Orientation Course. When developed, this training is for enlisted and 
officer accessions (i.e., Basic Military Training, U.S. Air Force Academy, Officer Training 
School, and Reserve Officer Training Corps) and establishes the minimum training proficiency 
standards new accessions must meet to survive in a CBRN-contested environment. 
6.3.3.  CBRN Defense Survival Course. This training is for all DAF military members to 
include non-deployable members, members assigned on a CONUS AFFORGEN FE, 
USAF/USSF military members currently assigned to any OCONUS OL, USSF military 
members tasked for OPLAN/CONPLAN support located OCONUS, and DAF mission 
essential civilians and contractors assigned to any OCONUS OL. This course establishes the 
minimum training proficiency standards DAF personnel must meet to survive in a CBRN-
contested environment. Only AFSC 3E9X1 and EM civilians and contractors will instruct this

Terms 
Aircrew Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (ACBRN) Defense Equipment—
Individually fitted aircrew unique CBRN protective equipment for the sole purpose of protecting 
operators who fly into and out of a CBRN hazard/contaminated environment. 
Aircrew Contamination Control Area (CCA)—A self-sustaining aircrew only mitigation 
control area that minimizes cross contamination to aircrew and is staffed by certified AFE 
technicians.

Apportioned Forces—Those forces and resources assumed to be available for planning as 
averaged over the fiscal year. Apportioned forces are what a CCMD can reasonably expect to be 
made available, but not necessarily an identification of the actual forces that will be allocated for 
use when a contingency plan transitions to execution. They may include those assigned, those 
expected through mobilization, and those programmed. This estimate informs and shapes CCDR 
resource-informed planning but does not identify the actual forces that may be allocated for use if 
a plan transitions to execution. The apportionment of a force does not establish a command 
relationship.

minimize the effect of CBRN use to the joint force and other mission critical personnel. Actions 
to manage consequences support US and foreign civil authorities and their populations by 
responding to a CBRN incident and mitigating the hazards and effects of WMD use. The method 
of tactics, techniques, and procedures to save and sustain lives, stabilize the situation, protect 
property and the environment, and meet basic human needs during an intentional, naturally 
occurring, or accidental CBRN incident on DAF and host nation territories that support forces 
and/or supplies in which the DAF is located on, operates in, or transits through.

removing radioactive material clinging to or around it. 
Dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability. 
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)—The electromagnetic radiation from a strong electronic pulse, 
most caused by a nuclear explosion that may couple with electrical or electronic systems to 
produce damaging current and voltage surges. 
Evacuation—1. The process of moving any person who is wounded, injured, or ill to and/or 
between medical treatment facilities. 2. The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a

83 
Force Protection—Preventive measures taken to mitigate hostile actions against DoD personnel 
(to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information. Note:  Force protection 
is a fundamental principle of all military operations to ensure the survivability of a commander’s 
forces. A comparison of NATO, joint, and single Service definitions is instructive. NATO Doctrine 
explains that “[t]he operational environment may have no discernable ‘front lines’ or ‘rear area’ 
and an adversary may be expected to target Allied vulnerabilities anywhere with a wide range of 
capabilities.” Consequently, NATO defines force protection as “measures and means to minimize 
the vulnerability of personnel, facilities, materiel, operations, and activities from threats and 
hazards to preserve freedom of action and operational effectiveness thereby contributing to 
mission success. 
Forward Operating Site (FOS)—A scalable location outside the U.S. and its territories intended 
for rotational use by operating forces. 
Groundcrew Chemical Ensemble—A whole body protective system that includes a protective 
mask (M50), filter set, protective suit, protective gloves with cotton inserts, and footwear covers 
or overboots. It also includes a booklet of M8 Paper, a roll of M9 Paper, a M295 Decontamination 
Kit, (RSDL, M-256 Chemical Detection Kit, and personal dosimeter. 
Host Nation—A nation which receives the forces and/or supplies of allied nations and/or NATO 
organizations to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territory. 
Host Nation Support—Civil and/or military assistance rendered by a nation to foreign forces 
within its territory during peacetime, crises, emergencies, or war based on agreements mutually 
concluded between nations. 
Immediate Decontamination—Decontamination carried out by individuals immediately upon 
becoming contaminated. It is performed to minimize casualties, save lives, and limit the spread of 
contamination. Also called emergency decontamination. 
Intelligence—1. The product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, analysis, 
evaluation, and interpretation of available information concerning foreign countries or areas. 2. 
Information and knowledge about an adversary obtained through observation, investigation, 
analysis, or understanding. 
Individual Protective Equipment (IPE)—1. In nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare, the 
personal clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from biological and chemical 
hazards and some nuclear effects. 2. For AF units, this includes the groundcrew chemical ensemble 
or specialized equipment and field gear. 
Main Operating Base (MOB)—A facility outside the U.S. and its territories with permanently 
stationed operating forces and robust infrastructure. 
Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A flexible system of protection against nuclear, 
biological, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only that 
protective clothing and equipment (mission-oriented protective posture gear) appropriate to the 
threat level, work rate imposed by the mission, temperature, and humidity. Also called MOPP. 
Noncombatant Evacuation Operations—Operations directed by the Department of State, the 
DoD, or other appropriate authority whereby noncombatants are evacuated from foreign countries 
when their lives are endangered by war, civil unrest, or natural disaster to safe havens or to the 
U.S. 
84 
DAFI10-2503  6 OCTOBER 2023 
Operational Decontamination—Decontamination carried out by an individual and/or a unit, 
restricted to specific parts of operationally essential equipment, materiel and/or working areas, to 
minimize contact and transfer hazards and to sustain operations. This may include decontamination 
of the individual beyond the scope of immediate decontamination as well as decontamination of 
mission-essential spares and limited terrain decontamination. 
Operational Environment (OE)—A composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences 
that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. 
Retrograde Cargo—Cargo evacuated from a theater. 
Security Cooperation—All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build 
defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly 
military capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with 
peacetime and contingency access to a host nation. See also security assistance/security assistance 
organization. 
Silver Flag—Training focused on bare base beddown and sustainment operations using basic 
expeditionary airfield resource assets in a realistic environment. Where possible, combat skills are 
added to the curriculum to ensure realism and help fortify a warrior mentality and ethos throughout 
the training. For more information, reference AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force 
Program. 
Split-Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A tactic that divides an airbase or OL into 
two or more sectors or zones to enable a commander to tailor MOPP levels and alarm conditions 
within each sector to reflect the current hazard and mission priorities within that area. 
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)—Applies basic and operational doctrine to military 
actions by describing the proper use of specific weapons systems or detailed TTPs to accomplish 
specific military operations. 
Thorough Decontamination—Decontamination carried out by a unit, with or without external 
support, to reduce contamination on personnel, equipment, materiel, and/or working areas equal 
to natural background or to the lowest possible levels, to permit the partial or total removal of IPE 
and to maintain operations with minimum degradation. This may include terrain decontamination 
beyond the scope of operational decontamination. 
Toxins—Poisonous substances produced by living organisms. A toxin is a toxic substance that 
can be produced by an animal, plant, or microbe. Some toxins can also be produced by molecular 
biologic techniques (protein toxins) or by chemical synthesis (low molecular weight toxins). 
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of destruction 
and/or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. WMD can be high 
explosives or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological weapons, but exclude the means of 
transporting or propelling the weapons where such means is a separable and divisible part of the 
weapons.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) DEFENSE 
PLANNING REFERENCES 
A3.1.  DAF commanders at all levels ensure their assigned forces are prepared to conduct 
operations in and through a CBRN-contested environment. Adequate preparation requires 
deliberate and adaptive planning to account for the complexity CBRN weapon effects will have 
on the OE. 
A3.2.  The service components provide input to and assist with the development of MTTP for 
CBRN defense. MTTPs are published by the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence Capabilities 
Development and Integration Directorate; Concepts, Organizations, and Doctrine Development 
Division; and Doctrine Branch at the U.S. Army CBRN School. 
A3.3.  The following MTTPs serve as primary doctrinal references on CBRN capabilities, 
operational and tactical planning, and principles of employment. They also outline fundamental 
TTPs for characterizing and managing CBRN threats and hazards, promoting near-real-time 
CBRN hazard awareness and understanding, and supporting CBRN passive defense operations.
