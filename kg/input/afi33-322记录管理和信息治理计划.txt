Chapter 1 
RECORDS MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Purpose.  Records serve a vital role in documenting the Air Force mission: providing 
evidence and accountability of the organization, function, policy, and procedures to the public, 
congress, and the Department of Defense; ensuring important information is available to support 
effective decision making, thus enhancing readiness and lethality; protecting the legal rights of the 
Air Force and the public. Records are created and received by military, civilian, and contractor 
personnel to document official business, serve as memory of the organization, provide a record of 
past events, and serve as the basis for future actions. 
1.1.1.  Records management includes planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, 
promoting, and additional managerial activities involved with respect to records creation, 
maintenance, use, and disposition. It involves preserving, setting up safeguards against illegal 
removal, loss, or destruction of records and promptly and systematically disposing records of 
temporary value. Records management is a subset of information governance, the policy-based 
control of information to meet all legal, regulatory, risk, and business demands. Records 
management is also a part of the information access programs, areas which involve the 
collection, use, search, protection, accessibility, and disposal of information. 
1.1.2.  The International Organization for Standardization established standards for records 
management such as International Organization for Standardization 15489, Information and 
Documentation - Records Management, April 2016, underlying several areas of National 
Archives and Records Administration guidance of which the Air Force must comply, 
information available at https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/requirements-
guidance.html (T-0). Announced by the Secretary of Defense in 2017, the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff introduced Information as a new, seventh joint function. 
1.2.  Federal and Departmental Guidance.  The Air Force records management program is 
governed by laws, regulations, and policies from the Federal Government, specifically the National 
Archives and Records Administration, Department of Defense, and the General Services 
Administration. See references in Attachment 1. 
1.3.  Records.  Records include all recorded information, regardless of form or characteristic, 
made or received by a federal agency under federal law. In addition, records are created and 
received in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for 
preservation an agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organizations functions, 
policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the United States Government or 
because of the informational value of data in them. Records do not include library and museum 
material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference, exhibition purposes or duplicate 
copies of records preserved only for convenience. Information in any medium can be a record, and 
this includes information created or received by the Air Force in contingency or wartime 
operations, as well as in all routine and peacetime business. Electronic media is required for the 
creation, use, storage, and management of Air Force records. Drafts can be altered but official 
records cannot. To determine if documentary material or electronic mail (e-mail) meets the 
definition of an official record, see Attachment 3. Official records belong to the Air Force and 
not to the individual who created or received the records. There is no distinction between “record” 
and “official record” in this publication. 
6 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
1.3.1.  A records disposition gives the Air Force legal authority to dispose of Air Force records 
when no longer needed for government business. The Archivist of the United States at the 
National Archives and Records Administration approves the records dispositions of federal 
records. The Air Force Records Disposition Schedule is the list of all Archives-approved 
records dispositions for the Air Force. 
1.3.2.  Removal and destruction of official records by Air Force members will be accomplished 
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, or other directives authorized 
in this instruction (such as a records freeze). (T-1). Personnel must dispose of classified records 
in accordance with Department of Defense Manual 5200.01-V3, Department of Defense 
Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information. (T-0). 
1.3.3.  Categories of Records 
1.3.3.1.  Temporary records. Temporary records are those approved by the National 
Archives for either immediate disposal or for disposal after a specified time or event. The 
vast majority of Air Force records are temporary. 
1.3.3.2.  Permanent records. Permanent records are those that have been determined by the 
Archivist to have enduring value as documentary evidence of the organization and 
functions of the Air Force. Permanent records are accessioned (e.g., transfer of legal 
ownership from the Air Force to the National Archives) for preservation to the National 
Archives. 
1.3.3.3.  Unscheduled Records. Unscheduled records are those that do not have an 
approved legal disposition and are treated as permanent until covered by an approved 
records retention. 
1.3.4.  Essential records. The federal essential records program includes two basic categories: 
(1) emergency operating records and (2) legal and financial rights records. Essential records 
can be original records or copies of records. 
1.3.4.1.  Emergency operating records. Records that an organization requires to continue 
functioning or to reconstitute operations after an emergency. They include emergency 
plans and directive(s), orders of succession, delegations of authority, staffing assignments, 
select program records required to continue the most vital agency operations, related policy 
or procedural records for the conduct of operations under emergency conditions, records 
required to resume normal operations after an emergency, records necessary for military 
efforts and mobilization, records required for protection of material, personnel, services, 
systems, public health, safety, and order; and those needed to conduct defense support to 
civil authorities. Emergency operating centers must keep essential records instantly 
available. (T-1). 
1.3.4.2.  Legal and financial rights records. These records protect the legal and financial 
rights of the Government and of the individuals directly affected by its activities. Examples 
include payroll, insurance, retirement, and valuable research records. Transfer hardcopy 
legal and financial rights records to a Federal Record Center (FRC) by contacting the base 
records manager. Standard Forms 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, or other 
documents (such as box inventories) that transfer essential records to a federal records 
center are themselves considered essential records since they preserve the record of the 
transfer. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
7 
1.3.5.  Records other than paper or electronic medium. Examples of non-electronic records 
include audiovisual records, x-rays, cartographic records, microform records, etc. The same 
general principles of record evaluation and the specific disposition instructions prescribed in 
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule apply regardless of physical form or 
characteristics of the medium. See Notes 212, 213, and 214 in the tables and rules located in 
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule for various dispositions of temporary records 
allow for media neutrality; that is, dispositions originally approved for temporary records in 
hardcopy media can also be used to dispose the same type of temporary records in non-paper 
media (e.g., electronic records with a temporary disposition). 
1.3.6.  Records created under a contract. This instruction applies to government contractors 
who create or maintain Air Force records. The government office of primary 
responsibility/program manager outsourcing a records management function shall include this 
instruction and its requirements in the contract statement of work, performance work 
statement, statement of need, or similar document. Reference the National Archives’ “Records 
management 
Language 
for 
Contracts,” 
https://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/policy/records-mgmt-language (T-1). Contractor functions should identify personnel 
to be trained. When no records professional is assigned or identified, the contractor quality 
assurance evaluator is responsible for all lifecycle record management and all duties assigned 
to the records professional. 
1.3.6.1.  When contractors create data for the government’s use, the contract must identify 
the background data that contractors must deliver to the government for possible reuse. (T-
1). 
1.3.6.2.  Before identifying background data that contractors must deliver to the 
government, program and contracting officers must coordinate with stakeholders. (T-1). 
These include records and information managers, historians and other United States 
Government agencies as appropriate. This is to ensure that all government needs are met, 
particularly when the data supports new missions or programs. 
1.3.6.3.  When the background data includes records, the contractor must deliver enough 
technical documentation to allow the Air Force or other agencies to use the data. (T-1). 
1.3.7.  Non-record. Non-record materials are those federally-owned informational materials 
that do not meet the statutory definition of records or that have been excluded from coverage 
by definition. Reference “Nonrecords Materials” section https://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/scheduling/id for more information. Although non-records are not governed by the 
rules of records management, offices must still manage their non-record material appropriately, 
especially those with personally identifiable information, to minimize breaches, redundant, 
obsolete, and/or trivial information. (T-1). 
1.3.7.1.  Personal Records. Personal records are documentary materials belonging to an Air 
Force member that are not used to conduct agency business. Reference “Personal Papers” 
section 
in 
https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/scheduling/id 
l 
for 
more 
information. Keep personal records separate from Air Force records. Do not include 
classified information in personal records. Maintain and dispose of correspondence 
designated “personal” or “private” but relating to the conduct of public business. 
8 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
1.3.7.1.1.  Personal Copies of Records and Non-record Materials. When leaving 
Government service, personnel may take copies of particular agency papers, working 
papers, and non-record materials, particularly if they plan to continue working in the 
same field or write memoirs. If personnel have not been maintaining extra copies of 
documents, the agency may arrange to make selected, preapproved copies for them 
prior to their departure. Reference section 3.5.1.1 
1.3.7.1.2.  Presidential appointees and other officials in policy-making positions may 
donate personal records to a presidential library, the National Archives, or the Air Force 
Historical Research Agency. Exception: Donated papers must not contain classified 
material or compartmented, restricted data, or once restricted data. Donors who qualify 
according to Department of Defense Manual 5200.01-V3, may be granted access to 
classified material. (T-0). 
1.3.7.2.  Private Civilian and Military Organizations’ Records. Records of private 
organizations (such as the American Red Cross, Air Force Aid Society, federal credit 
unions, various national scouting organizations, Little League, American Legion, hobby 
clubs, and other special interest groups) serving Air Force communities are not within the 
scope of this instruction. See Air Force Policy Directive 34-1, Air Force Services, for 
additional details on private organizations. 
1.3.8.  State Records. These records are created by military members, most specifically Air 
National Guard members, in performance of state-funded activities and belong to the state 
funding activity. When there is contention or ambiguity regarding ownership of records created 
by the Air National Guard, the Guard unit’s base records manager will contact the Air National 
Guard Command records manager for guidance. (T-1). If necessary, the Air National Guard 
will coordinate with the Air Force Records Officer and any applicable command records 
manager. (T-1). State or federal records pertaining to Regular Air Force or Air Force Reserve 
issues should be directed to the command records manager. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020

Chapter 2 
RECORDS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
2.1.  Organizations. 
2.1.1.  Air Force units at all levels are required to document their organization’s functions, 
policies, procedures, and activities, and such documents are considered records. These records 
must be preserved by implementing effective life cycle management procedures and must be 
managed consistently to ensure they are complete, accurate, trustworthy, and easily accessible. 
(T-1). Every Air Force activity must manage its records to comply with legal accountability 
requirements (for example, audits, records searches due to litigations, protection of rights). (T-
1). 
2.1.2.  The key to an effective records management program is the identification, storage, 
search, retrieval, protection, and disposition of records. Ownership on the part of every Air 
Force member coupled with commander’s involvement is essential. 
2.1.3.  All Department of the Air Force members must effectively manage and protect Air 
Force records, information, and data. (T-0). Recorded information shall remain protected while 
at rest, in use, and in leaving the endpoints, applications, infrastructure, and networks within 
the control of the organization. (T-0). To ensure protection and to restrict access to authorized 
users, recorded information shall be inventoried, classified, labeled, and encrypted where 
appropriate. (T-0). Ensure a sound governance strategy to retain, store, archive, delete recorded 
information in a compliant manner to manage it effectively to enable and support a zero trust 
environment. (T-1). Zero trust is a data and application access strategy that assumes all 
resource requests originate from an untrusted source. Access is granted for each request only 
after confidence – in both the user and device – is established through identity verification and 
connection context attributes. 
2.2.  Formal Roles and Responsibilities. 
2.2.1.  The Air Force Chief Information Officer has overall responsibility for the Air Force 
Records Management Program. 
2.2.2.  The Senior Agency Official (SAF/CNZ) for Records Management, appointed by the 
Chief Information Officer, is responsible for ensuring the Air Force efficiently and properly 
complies with all applicable records management statutes, regulations, and policies. 
2.2.3.  Commanders. Commanders and civilian directors at all levels must implement the 
records management program for their organizations as outlined below in this section. (T-1). 
They are responsible for the physical and legal custody of all records within their organization 
to include monitoring compliance of legal and regulatory requirements. Commanders and 
directors shall: 
2.2.3.1.  Organizations shall create mission-related records, promptly stage eligible 
records, and dispose temporary records and transfer permanent records according to the 
Records Disposition Schedule. (T-0). Determine records access and enforces records 
management compliance. 
2.2.3.2.  Must coordinate with records professionals at all levels to obtain resolution of 
records management issues at organizations within purview. (T-1). 
10 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
2.2.3.3.  Ensure appropriate records professional roles (command records managers, 
agency record managers and base records managers) must be filled within their 
organization. (T-1). Records professionals will have sufficient access to records 
management systems. (T-1). Role shall be reflected within the relevant job or position 
description. (T-1). Exceptions: authorized for organizations within the National Capital 
Region that receive records management support through the Headquarters Air Force 
Records Manager. At Joint Bases where the Air Force is not the Supporting Component, 
the Supported Component commander shall appoint a base records manager to manage 
Supported Component records. (T-1). 
2.2.3.4.  Will work directly with their appropriate records professional to ensure the 
integrity of their organization’s records management program. (T-1). Will ensure the base 
records manager is appropriately aligned to accomplish wing-level tasks. (T-1). 
2.2.3.5.  Will ensure records management data calls, record searches, litigation holds and 
other requests for information are conducted and completed per this instruction and as 
defined requirements in the Air Force Records Information Management System or by the 
managing attorney. (T-1). 
2.2.3.6.  Will ensure proper management of classified records, including sensitive 
compartmental information, and that all activities possessing classified records comply 
with Air Force records management data calls and records searches. (T-1). As needed, 
commanders will ensure appropriate personnel have the necessary access to exercise 
oversight. (T-1). 
2.2.3.7.  Ensure storage facilities comply with Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 
1234, Facility Standards for Records Storage, current edition; if an installation commander 
maintains a staging facility for the temporary storage of hardcopy records pending 
destruction or transfer to a federal records center, including the centralized storage of 
electronically stored inactive records (T-0). 
2.2.3.7.1.  If the staging facility is unable to comply, commanders shall ensure risk 
mitigation procedures are in place to preserve the records from damage, loss, 
unauthorized access and destruction. (T-1). In such cases, commanders will submit a 
risk management plan and update the command records manager within 60 calendar 
days of taking command. (T-1). 
2.2.3.7.2.  The National Archives and Records Administration will no longer accept 
temporary and permanent hardcopy records from federal agencies after 31 December 
2022, which is included in the 2018 Government Reform Plan and the Office of 
Management and Budget Memorandum Transition to Electronic Records M-19-21, 
https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/M-19-21.pdf. OMB M-
19-21 also directs the closure of base staging facilities by 31 December 2022; make 
preparations for the management of hardcopy records to meet the deadline. (T-0). 
2.2.3.8.  Shall ensure eligible records are promptly and properly transferred to the relevant 
staging area or the designated federal records center. (T-1). 
2.2.3.9.  Within 60 calendar days of assuming command commanders shall publish a 
records management plan that implements the records management program for their 
organization or affirm the existing plan in use. (T-1). Additionally, they will work with 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
11 
their records professional and legal counsel to ensure completeness. (T-1). The plan will 
be in memorandum format and submitted to the command records managers for approval. 
(T-1). For field operating agencies/direct reporting units, the plan will be submitted to Air 
Force Records Officer for approval. (T-1). The command records manager may provide a 
default plan for the installation if a records management plan is not published. 
2.2.3.10.  Once approved, commanders will ensure their plan is available and accessible to 
unit members, the Air Force Records Officer, and upon request, the Inspector General, 
legal, and other authorized stakeholders. (T-1). Documentation is not only intended as 
guidance for the organization, but also to provide a record of procedures in the event of a 
litigation hold or deposition. The following constitute documentation requirements: 
2.2.3.10.1.  Structure: Must describe the structure of the records management process; 
including specific roles and responsibilities of unit members. (T-1). 
2.2.3.10.2.  Records Lifecycle: Describe how records will be managed throughout their 
lifecycle, including paper and electronic. Describe how they will be created (electronic 
by default). Describe where they will be stored/preserved/backed up (information 
technology systems, shared drives, SharePoint®, records management application). 
Describe how they will be protected (particularly those with personally identifiable 
information with protections such as data-at-rest encryption, access controls,

disposition schedule by manual or automated means. Ensure electronic records data having 
a permanent retention are preserved for accessioning to the National Archives. If the 
records data is unscheduled, do not dispose the records data until the records data is covered 
by a National Archives-approved records disposition schedule. If any unauthorized 
dispositions of electronic records occur from the lack of records schedule implementation 
instructions and controls required for an information technology investment, this 
constitutes a lost records incident and must be reported to the National Archives through 
the command records manager. (T-0).

CHAPTER 3 
MANAGING RECORDS 
3.1.  Records Maintenance Objectives. 
3.1.1.  The overall goal of the Air Force records management program is to adequately and 
properly document the policies, transactions, and management of Air Force activities; 
therefore, the organizational objectives of records maintenance is to achieve the following: 
3.1.2.  Document Core Functions. Organizations must identify and manage those records 
involved with core functions of that organization, including, but not limited to operations, 
training, logistics, facilities, financial transactions, and personnel transactions. (T-0). 
3.1.3.  Ensure Proper and Timely Disposition of Records. Records must be maintained and 
retained for approved periods of time. (T-0). However, retention beyond these periods often 
incurs cost, and may incur risk to the Air Force. Personnel at all levels must ensure proper and 
timely disposition of records, whether this results in authorized destruction, archiving, or 
transfer. (T-0). The Records Disposition Schedule documents the approved retention period 
and the methods and timing of disposition. 
3.1.4.  Ensure Availability and Protection of Records. Records must be made available to those 
who require access. (T-1). Simultaneously, records must be protected against unauthorized 
disclosure to those who should not have access, including individuals and organizations, both 
within and outside the Air Force. (T-1). The Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act 
govern specific rights of individual and protection of government records. 
3.2.  Air Force Records Information Management System. 
3.2.1.  The Air Force Records Information Management System is the mandatory, unclassified, 
web-based tool suite designed to enhance, standardize, and automate Air Force records 
management and procedures such as developing, updating, and approving an inventory of 
records; tracking staff visits and record professional appointments, contact information and 
training; orchestrating the freezing/unfreezing of records; facilitating staging area 
management; and streamlining record transfer and staging; completing non-Freedom of 
Information Act records searches. The system enables oversight of records management across 
multiple levels of the Air Force. The Records Disposition Schedule, maintained in the system, 
is the authorized source for record dispositions; supplements to the Records Disposition 
Schedule are not authorized. The Air Force Records Officer shall be the update authority for 
this system. (T-1). 
3.2.2.  Accounts are created by the base records manager. Accounts in tenant units are created 
by the host base records manager with oversight by the unit, major command, field operating 
agency, or direct reporting unit records professional. Deployed accounts are established 
through the base records manager or the Air Force Records Information Management System 
help desk. Major command, field operating agency, and direct reporting units accounts are 
approved by the Air Force Records Officer. 
3.3.  Inventory of Records. 
3.3.1.  Inventory of records titles and folder subtitles will not contain sensitive, classified, For 
Official Use Only, or Privacy Act information. From the Air Force Records Information 
24 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
Management System, inventories of record replicated on electronic records management 
shared drives containing folders with sensitive information/records must include the 
appropriate marking in the folder title. (T-1). Restrict access to users with approved authority 
(to include clearance), an official need to know, and any additional requirements (e.g., a signed 
non-disclosure agreement). Review and properly place personnel in the appropriate permission 
groups in the applicable inventory of records to allow access to electronic records needed for 
business purposes. Primary folder titles reflect the inventory of records title; sub-folders are 
not numbered to allow project naming and alphabetical sorting by the action officers and are 
not reflected on the inventory of records. Sub-folders will contain only the record types 
described in the table and rule of the primary folder. (T-1). Segregation of records by 
disposition is required by the National Archives. The Commander or base records manager 
will approve the inventory of records. (T-1). 
3.3.2.  Identify essential records within e-file areas by placing an “E” or “Essential” directly 
following the e-file folder/directory title. If the folder/directory contains both essential and 
non-essential records identify each essential document by placing an “E” or “Essential” 
directly following the document title. This is done to ensure security, protection, access, 
retrieval, and evacuation of the essential records. 
3.3.3.  Use the “location” field of the inventory of records to show where documents are filed. 
Subdivisions (project folders) are not required to be added in the Air Force Records 
Information Management System. Use the “media” field of the inventory of records to show 
what type of media the records reside (Paper/electronic). 
3.3.4.  Inventory of Records Review. The commander must conduct (annually as a minimum) 
a systematic review of inventory of records to include (T-1). 
3.3.4.1.  Systematic file cutoffs (breaks). (T-1). 
3.3.4.2.  The retirement of eligible records to a records center. (T-1). 
3.3.4.3.  The prompt disposal of temporary records when their retention period. (T-1). 
3.3.4.4.  The timely transfer of permanent records to National Archives and Records 
Administration. (T-1). 
3.3.4.5.  The review of essential records. (T-1). 
3.4.  Records Maintenance Procedures. 
3.4.1.  Office of Management and Budget guidance requires all federal agencies to minimize 
paper records to those required to comply historical and legal requirements. Therefore, Air 
Force records are to be created and maintained as electronic information unless required by 
law to be hard copy. Functional processes will only create new non-electronic records types 
after receiving approval by the Air Force Records Officer (T-1). Air Force personnel requests 
to create and maintain paper records must include a justification that is compliant with the 
exemptions specified in the United States Code 44, Paperwork Elimination Act, Public Law 
107-347, E-Government Act, and Department and Air Force Net-Centric Strategies. (T-1). 
3.4.1.1.  Air Force activities are encouraged to eliminate existing paper records. Existing 
non-permanent paper records may be destroyed after scanning to an approved format and 
validating content, or inputting the information into an electronic record keeping system. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
25 
Permanent records, once scanned and validated, may only be destroyed after coordinating 
with National Archives and obtaining National Archives approval. 
3.4.2.  All records, regardless of medium, will be maintained separate from non-records. (T-
1). 
3.4.3.  The commander determines the storage location for organizational records. This may 
be any authorized shared electronic storage location, but must be accessible by unit personnel 
requiring access, protected against unauthorized access, and backed up on a frequency 
determined by local requirements. (T-1). To prevent lost records, manager must ensure data 
from backups is accessible. (T-1). 
3.4.4.  Records storage areas shall be structured to match the organization inventory of records; 
folders are created for each item on the inventory of records, regardless of medium. (T-1). As 
required 
by 
National 
Archives 
(https://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/publications/disposition-of-federal-records) separate records by disposition sub-
folders as necessary, to further organize and categorize records. Label folders and files 
consistently and clearly to allow for easy access by unit personnel. 
3.4.5.  All records, regardless of medium, will be annotated to show the date of the record. E-
records may be either labeled on the document or within the file name. (T-1). 
3.4.6.  Security. 
3.4.6.1.  Only authorized users will have access to store records in the records storage area. 
(T-1). 
3.4.6.2.  When records contain Privacy Act, Personally identifiable information or other 
sensitive data, the commander assigns read-only access rights to personnel who have a 
need-to-know as determined by the appropriate authority 
3.4.6.3.  Classified Records. 
3.4.6.3.1.  Classified records are subject to Air Force and Department of Defense 
guidance on handling, storing, transmitting, and disposing of classified information and 
media in addition to all relevant records management guidance. 
3.4.6.3.2.  Classified records shall be stored separately from unclassified unless it is 
necessary to maintain continuity of a particular transaction or event, in which case the 
unclassified records may reside with the classified records to avoid spillage. (T-1). 
3.4.6.3.3.  Keep label and file designations the same as the folders containing 
unclassified material. When adding a classified record to a large unclassified file, 
substitute a cross-reference sheet for the classified record. Do not make any classified 
entries on the cross-reference sheets. 
3.4.6.3.4.  In addition to penalties specified for misuse or mishandling classified 
information, laws and regulations regarding unlawful or unauthorized acts involving 
records may also apply. 
3.4.7.  Filing. 
3.4.7.1.  Assemble documents for filing in the same manner as required for their creation, 
dispatch, and use with the latest action on top. Save the last e-mail response to capture an 
26 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
entire dialogue. Save e-mail attachments in their original format or convert to one of the 
approved formats. Review the file and take necessary actions to obtain missing information 
in the file or make a notation to show what part of the file is missing or where it is filed if 
included in another folder. E-record pointers (hyperlinks) may be used as long as the record 
metadata reflects the retention of the longest record associated to the linked document. If a 
record requires a destruction certification, file a copy of the destruction certificate with the 
record or in the folder. 
3.4.7.2.  File electronic and paper records within 48 hours so they are available and 
accessible. 
3.4.8.  Cutting off and disposition. 
3.4.8.1.  Commanders review the records annually, perform cut-off procedures (moves 
from active files to inactive files) as required, and separate active from inactive records. 
Exception: There are many record series for which a cut-off date is not proper, such as 
those eligible for immediate destruction when superseded, obsolete, or no longer needed. 
Also, there are perpetual files that continue as active until the specific disposition occurs. 
3.4.8.2.  The commanders destroy, transfer, or retire eligible records according to the AF 
Records Disposition Schedule. They may delegate this responsibility to authorized users 
within the organization, particularly when working with sensitive records or those with 
perpetual dispositions. Anyone may recommend changes to the Records Disposition 
Schedule to account for new, obsolete, or changed records used by Air Force organizations. 
3.4.9.  Official Records on Personally-Owned Computers, Hand-Held and Mobile Devices. 
Other than an individual’s personal records (e.g. medical, personnel, etc.) or records released 
publically, it is highly discouraged for any Air Force record to be created, stored, or maintained 
on any personally owned devices, E-mail accounts, and social media accounts. Employees 
(military, civilian and contractor) must transfer records created on a personally-owned 
computers such as laptops, handheld, or stored on portable storage devices to the office 
repository. (T-1). The commander monitors and ensures the transfer of records to an approved 
repository is accomplished within 48 hours in order to comply with Public Law 113-187, 
Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014. 
3.4.10.  Cross-Referencing. DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, will be used to cross-reference 
non-electronic records when stored in two or more places or on two or more media. (T-1). This 
form will also be used to show non-electronic records stored in locations other than the 
designated storage area. (T-1). Create a shortcut to the file or folder for cross-referenced 
electronic records instead of duplicating the file or using the form. 
3.4.10.1.  If non-electronic records are copied, use the copies instead of the DD Form 2861. 
Mark the copies by using “X” in the upper right-hand corner to show where the duplicate 
copies are filed. Cross reference of e-records may be accomplished in the metadata fields. 
3.4.11.  Charge Out Records. For physical records, Air Force Form 614, Charge Out Record, 
or Air Force Form 614A, Charge Out Record (Continuation), will be used in place of a record 
or folder removed from the files area. (T-1). 
3.4.12.  Text messages on government owned/issued devices that conduct government 
business are records per the Federal Records Act of 1950 and Presidential and Federal Records 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
27 
Act Amendments of 2014. As such, all business related text messages must be filed in the 
appropriate electronic records keeping system. (T-0). It is permissible to do so by using the 
screen shot feature on the mobile device and forwarding that file via E-mail for filing to the 
appropriate inventory of record. The commander ensures the transfer of records to the 
electronic records keeping system is accomplished within 48 hours. 
3.5.  Process to Request Copies or Removal of Official Records. 
3.5.1.  Copies of official records for transitioning personnel outside the federal Government 
may be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act process; refer to Air Force Freedom 
of Information Act Website. No Freedom of Information Act request is required if the personal 
information in the official records pertain to the transitioning personnel themselves and do not 
fall under a Privacy Act exemption. 
3.5.1.1.  Personnel are authorized to remove extra copies of unclassified papers (with 
agency approval) that they have drafted, reviewed, or otherwise acted upon. However, 
additional copies may not be made solely to facilitate removal. 
3.5.1.2.  Non-record materials such as copies of training slides received at a conference, 
copies of stock publications, and any personal meeting notes may be removed by the 
transitioning personnel. 
3.5.1.3.  Classified, sensitive, restricted, and formally restricted information is subject to 
all normal restrictions on dissemination, notwithstanding paragraphs 3.5.1.1 and 3.5.1.2. 
3.5.2.  Employees going to another federal agency are not required to use the Freedom of 
Information Act process. Prior to leaving the agency, an employee wishing to take any records 
to the new agency must present those records to the Office of Primary Responsibility (per 
Department of Defense Manual 5400.07_Air Force Manual 33-302, Freedom of Information 
Act Program) and the commander for approval. (T-0). 
3.5.3.  No documentary material, though judged to be non-record material, shall be withdrawn 
if it creates a gap in the official files and impairs the completeness of essential documentation 
(T-1). Indexes or other finding aids, necessary for the use of the official files, may not be 
removed. 
3.6.  Essential Records Plan. 
3.6.1.  Essential records. Depending on the media, organizations must ensure that the 
hardware, software and documentation it needs to access essential records will be available 
following an emergency or disaster. (T-1). 
3.6.2.  Each unit/office will develop an essential records plan if the commander has determined 
the unit maintains essential records with the assistance of the functional area managers. (T-1). 
The plan is a description of records that are essential to continue operations or for the protection 
of legal and financial rights. The plan also includes specific measures for the appropriate 
storage and periodic cycling of copies of those records. The plan should be incorporated into 
the appropriate Continuity of Operations Plan and/or Disaster and Recovery Plan. 
3.6.3.  Organizations must exercise caution in designating records as essential and in 
conducting the essential records inventory. (T-1). Only those records series or electronic 
information systems (or portions of them) most vital to emergency operations or the 
28 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
preservation of legal or financial rights should be so designated. Review and update the 
essential records inventory annually. 
3.6.4.  The description of the essential records is based on identification and inventorying. 
Units will take the following steps to identify and inventory essential records: (T-1). 
3.6.4.1.  Consultation with the official responsible for emergency coordination. See 
https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/essential-records/essential-records-guide, 
National Archives and Records Administration’s Essential Records Guide. 
3.6.4.2.  Review base statutory and regulatory responsibilities and existing emergency 
plans for insights into the functions and records that may be included in the essential 
records inventory. 
3.6.4.3.  Review of documentation created for the contingency planning and risk 
assessment phase of emergency preparedness. The offices performing those functions 
would be an obvious focus of an inventory. 
3.6.4.4.  Review of current inventory of records for those responsible for performing vital 
functions or may be responsible for preserving rights. 
3.6.4.5.  Review the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule to determine which records 
series potentially qualify as essential. 
3.6.4.6.  Geographically-separate locations ensure copies are a sufficient distance away to 
avoid them being subject to the same emergency. Organizations may use other office 
locations, off-site locations or storage facilities maintained by a third party. Base staging 
areas may also be used and recommend essential records be maintained in one general 
location for ease of retrieval and identification. Specify on the Standard Form 135 that they 
are essential records (duplicate copies). 
3.6.5.  The inventory of essential records should include: 
3.6.5.1.  The name of the office responsible for the records series or electronic information 
system containing essential information. 
3.6.5.2.  The title of each records series or information system containing essential 
information. 
3.6.5.3.  Indication of whether the series or system is an emergency operating essential 
record or an essential record relating to legal and financial rights. 
3.6.5.4.  The medium on which the record is recorded. 
3.6.5.5.  The physical location for offsite storage of copies of the records series or system. 
Essential records can be kept at offsite storage to ensure that they are not damaged or 
destroyed should an emergency occur at normal place of business. 
3.6.5.6.  The frequency with which the records are to be cycled. This is the recurring 
removal of obsolete copies of essential records and replacing them with current copies of 
essential records. This may occur daily, weekly, quarterly, yearly or at other designated 
intervals. 
3.6.5.7.  A licensed copy of the software to enable software-dependent essential records to 
be used. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
29 
3.6.6.  The essential records plan must include specified staff responsibilities, methods to 
properly inform all staff about essential records, processes to ensure current and complete 
designation of essential records, adequate protections for the essential records, and procedures 
to ensure access and immediate use of the essential records when needed. (T-1). 
3.7.  Deployed Units. 
3.7.1.  Personnel in the Area of Responsibility must take action to identify, collect, organize 
and preserve all records, including paper, electronic, imagery, and recorded information, 
related to current and projected operations and maintain them as permanent according to the 
Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 10-6, Rule 01.00. (T-1). Deployed Air Force 
members not assigned to an Air Force unit will adhere to the respective non-Air Force records 
guidance and rules associated with attached unit. (T-1). 
3.7.2.  General Rules. 
3.7.2.1.  Inventory of Records for Deployed Units. Inventories of records for deployed 
units should consist as a minimum of items that cover maintenance and disposition, policy 
and precedent, delegations, general correspondence, office administrative files, transitory, 
and presentations in accordance with the Records Disposition Schedule. Add additional 
items as mandated by the specific mission of the deployed unit. 
3.7.2.2.  Records of deployed units will remain in the office of records’ inactive files for 2 
years at which time they will be transferred to the designated sister or parent major 
command, field operating agency, or direct reporting units the unit falls under. (T-1). 
3.7.2.3.  Base/unit closures/deactivation records will be identified in a memo signed by the 
base records manager and forwarded through the command records manager to the Air 
Force Records Officer. (T-1). Official records will be directly transferred out of the area of 
responsibility. (T-1). 
3.7.2.4.  Records transferred from the area of responsibility will be accompanied by a 
Standard Form 135 and a list/log of the pertinent records. (T-1). The list/log must describe 
the records in the boxes. When transferring e-records on CD-ROM, digital video device, 
etc., the Standard Form 135 will be in a separate file on the disk and the list/log of pertinent 
records will be in a separate document on the disk. (T-1). 
3.7.2.5.  Establish an essential records program for all units that create, maintain and collect 
records in the Area of Responsibility. 
3.7.2.6.  Units/Forward Operating Locations with poor storage space may send records to 
the designated sister or parent unit, but must document such action. (T-1). 
3.7.2.7.  Prior to shipment, must ensure folders are labeled properly (record title from the 
Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, year created and unit/office designation). (T-1). 
Shall ensure boxes are properly marked on the outside. (T-1). Area of Responsibility units 
should obtain assistance from their parent unit as much as possible. 
3.7.2.8.  The originating office will ship the boxes to the sister/parent/major command. (T-
1). 
30 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
3.7.2.9.  If feasible, the sister/parent unit in the Area of Responsibility may consolidate 
shipments, based on record type, and forward to the appropriate stateside agency (major 
command equivalent) for processing to the staging area or federal records center. 
3.7.2.10.  Bases/units in the Area of Responsibility will backup electronic records and 
drafts according to local network procedures. (T-1). The base or unit will also establish 
local procedures to ensure shared and or network drives are backed up at another, 
geographically separate location. (T-1). 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020

Chapter 4 
MANAGING ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION 
4.1.  Electronically Stored Information.  This chapter describes the particulars of managing 
Electronically Stored Information throughout all phases of its lifecycle. Electronically Stored 
Information is subject to the regulations and guidance that govern all records, as well as some that 
pertain to Electronically Stored Information in particular such as the Amendments to the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. These are published to address issues associated with the preservation 
and production of all information in digital form. See Chapter 9. 
4.1.1.  Electronically Stored Information includes any information stored in a medium from 
which it can be retrieved and examined. 
4.1.2.  Common sources of Electronically Stored Information are e-mail, working papers, 
drafts, duplicates, copies and data in information systems, etc. 
4.2.  Electronically Stored Information Management Roles and Responsibilities. 
4.2.1.  The Air Force Records Officer is the approval/waiver authority for Electronic Record 
Keeping systems within the Air Force containing long-term or permanent records. 
4.2.2.  The client support technicians work closely with the network support staff and base 
records manager to ensure sufficient space is allocated for the storage of official e-records and 
to ensure appropriate permissions are established for records professionals and users. 
4.2.3.  The network support staff works closely with the base records manager and cyber 
security liaison to maintain a central e-file repository for the installation and ensures the 
repository is backed up in case of catastrophic failure to facilitate successful disaster recovery. 
4.3.  Electronic Records Systems. 
4.3.1.  Paper versus non-paper. Technology has changed the flow of communication and 
contributed to the challenges of managing records in media other than paper. Various 
automated systems already store information as records. Conversion of paper documents to 
electronic format as well as scanning documents to a portable document format is acceptable. 
Electronic records are the media of choice for use, storage and maintenance. New record 
management systems containing paper records must be approved by the Air Force Records 
Officer. (T-1). Requests must include justification compliant with the exemptions specified in 
the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, E-Government Act and Department and Air 
Force Net-Centric Strategies. (T-1). Existing record management systems consisting of paper 
records may be destroyed after scanning to an approved format and validating content, or 
inputting information in an Electronic Record Keeping System. 
4.3.2.  Electronic Record Keeping Concept. The Electronic Record Keeping concept requires 
a system that will accept, preserve, and make accessible any type of electronic document. 
Moreover, it must ensure access regardless of hardware and software used to create the 
document. (T-1). The volume of electronic records being created and the rapid pace of 
technological change present challenges for identification, preservation, and maintenance of 
access for electronic records. Records professionals should be mindful of both the challenges 
and the opportunities presented by technology in regards to electronic records. An Electronic 
Record Keeping System meets the National Archives’ requirements to create, capture, manage 
32 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
and preserve electronic records aligned with approved records schedules. In an Electronic 
Record Keeping System with permanent electronic records, manage the records via automated 
methods. 
4.3.2.1.  Documentation. The Electronic Record Keeping System owner or program 
manager must address the disposition of records in all life cycle phases and incorporate the 
documentation into applicable tables and rules of the Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule. (T-1). The system owner keeps satisfactory information to access, retrieve, and 
make changes to the records and up-to-date technical documentation for each Electronic 
Record Keeping that produces, uses, or stores data files. If an Electronic Record Keeping 
System contains and manages permanent electronic records, document and test the 
capability to transfer the records to the National Archives. 
4.3.2.2.  Electronic Record Keeping Decisions. A system owner must base decisions to 
initiate an Electronic Record Keeping on the serviceability of the records. (T-1). Records 
are serviceable if the system and filing procedures provide timely search and retrieval, and 
ease of update with an adequate audit trail. Electronic record keeping systems must be 
Department of Defense 5015.02-STD compliant and have records management 
approval/coordination. (T-0). 
4.3.2.3.  Electronic Record Keeping System Approval. The system owner prepares an Air 
Force Form 1341, or its Air Force Records Officer-approved equivalent (e.g. Information 
Technology Investment Portfolio Suite) and an Air Force Form 525, with decision logic 
table (see Table 4.1.) for submission through the base records manager and command 
records manager to the Air Force Records Officer for approval. The Air Force Records 
Officer then facilitates a system review by National Archives staff to gain system approval 
and to have the system and its records scheduled in the Records Disposition Schedule.

Schedule 3, 
Item3a (1) 
4.3.3.  Electronic Records in Automated Information Systems. Records in Automated 
Information Systems must be identified and managed according to Department of Defense 
Instruction 5000.02T, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, and Air Force Instruction 
63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. (T-0). The Automated Information 
Systems office of primary responsible must determine the appropriate Records Disposition 
Schedule rule for each record and how long the records will remain in the system. (T-1). 
Accountability and enforceability of the record dispositions for system records are 
accomplished by scheduling the system with the National Archives and Records 
Administration through the Air Force Records Officer. Prepare Air Force Form 1341 or input 
into the Air Force Records Officer-approved equivalent, e.g., Information Technology 
Investment Portfolio Suite, for submission through the base records manager, command 
records manager or agency record manager to the Air Force Records Officer for approval. 
4.3.4.  Electronic Record Keeping Requirements. 
4.3.4.1.  System security is an additional critical requirement for Electronically Stored 
Information, and Electronically Stored Information must be maintained on networks and 
systems having an Authority to Operate to the highest sensitivity or classification of the 
Electronically Stored Information. (T-1). Be aware that some types of Electronically Stored 
Information will require security controls (to include physical separation) beyond that 
provided by segregation according to classification (e.g. unclassified vs secret). (T-1). The 
requirements governing the information should drive the system security requirements of 
the Electronic Record Keeping System. 
34 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
4.3.4.2.  Proper allocation of resources, to include computing and storage, is an important 
consideration for Electronic Records Keeping Systems. The resources necessary will 
evolve over time, not only as the amount of Electronically Stored Information increases, 
but as the technologies used to manage it change. 
4.3.5.  Records will not be maintained in systems or media not approved as an Electronic 
Record Keeping System such as e-mail systems or backup tapes, as these are mainly for restore 
purposes only and are subject to deletion and/or rewrite. (T-1). 
4.3.5.1.  Exception:  E-mails received and sent by General Officers, Senior Executive 
Series members, and civilian equivalents, including Senior Leader and Senior Technician 
personnel, and selected organizational mailboxes are captured and retained permanently 
based on the National Archives’ Capstone approach - https://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/email-mgmt. The Capstone process automatically makes a copy of every e-mail 
sent to and from identified accounts and stores those copies in a separate message preserved 
account. The preserved copy of the e-mails is inaccessible to the senders and recipients, 
but will be accessible for official use purposes such as the required processing of Freedom 
of Information Act requests. (T-1). Preserved e-mails will be retained for 15 years and then 
transferred to the National Archives where they will be made available as part of the public 
record in accordance with declassification and standard public release procedures. (T-1). 
4.4.  Electronic Records management. 
4.4.1.  Responsible electronic records management ensures the accessibility, confidentiality, 
and integrity of Electronically Stored Information is maintained throughout the records 
lifecycle. Similar to physical records, e-record life cycle includes creating, filing, retrieval and 
use, transferring, and disposal. Obtain security group access of electronic records stored in 
inventory of records through the local information technology support professionals. 
4.4.2.  Fundamental records management rules are media neutral and apply to all 
Electronically Stored Information. 
4.4.3.  When evaluating e-records, consider if all information contained in source documents 
is committed to the system; if medium involved will be exportable into a readable format for 
future reference such as audits, accountability, backup data to reports, and so forth; if e-records 
are duplications of records, substitutions of records or new records; and if the records meet the 
requirements of National Archives and General Services Administration concerning the long-
term retention value of audiovisual or cartographic records. Every five years, ensure electronic 
records are accessible, especially those with a retention of more than seven years; in the event 
of a software change, convert to a National Archives-approved file format or applicable 
software file format. 
4.4.4.  In contracts with third parties that will have physical custody of records (including a 
cloud-based environment), include contract provisions to export Air Force records into a new 
system at the end of the contract, and to transfer records to the National Archives if they are 
scheduled as permanent. 
4.5.  Electronically Stored Information and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
4.5.1.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedures create a broad description of what Electronically 
Stored Information must be disclosed, place a time limit for the disclosure, and institute a 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
35 
“good-faith” test for retention schedules. These new rules often require quick identification 
and preservation of electronically stored information and a delayed response to electronically 
stored information requests can be costly and compromise Air Force interests during litigation. 
4.5.2.  Electronically Stored Information under Federal Rules of Civil Procedures has been 
expanded to include any type of information, drafts, records, and non-record materials, relevant 
to imminent litigation. See Chapter 9. 
4.6.  Managing the E-File Area. 
4.6.1.  Organizations maintain e-records with a retention period of 10 years or less in the e-
files area in a National Archives and Records Administration approved format. Visit the 
National Archives web site https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-
guidance.html for the most current list of approved formats. If unable to convert the records 
to one of the approved formats, holder must maintain a copy of the software the documents 
were created in to ensure that the document can be retrieved, opened, printed and used in the 
future. (T-1). 
4.6.1.1.  Organizations maintaining e-records with a retention period of more than 10 years 
must validate periodically that the e-records and the media which stores the e-records can 
still be accessed. (T-1). If not, take measures to convert to a suitable format (for example, 
National Archives-approved format) and/or migrate to a current storage media. Preserve 
the metadata to the greatest extent possible, especially for e-records with a permanent 
retention scheduled to be accessioned to the National Archives. 
4.6.1.2.  Apply basic records management principles to manage the e-file area. Cut-off, 
purge, dispose, transfer, and file e-records the same time/manner as paper records. When 
applicable, mark draft documents inside the e-file area; otherwise maintain draft documents 
outside the e-file area. 
4.6.2.  Managing e-records on a shared network drive involves the participation of the network 
support staff, records professionals, and commanders. The illustration in Figure 4.1 depicts an 
example of e-files directory created on a shared network drive. The e-filing system must mirror 
the current office inventory of records. (T-1). Consistency across the unit and base is a solid 
approach. 
36 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
Figure 4.1.  E-Files Directory (example). 
 
4.6.2.1.  Network support staff will utilize dedicated space to store e-records. This 
dedicated space should function as a central repository for filing electronic documents. 
Non-record documents (e.g. personal correspondence, reference materials, copies of 
records, etc.) should not be stored in the area designated for records. 
4.6.2.2.  Base records managers, network support staff, commanders, records professionals 
and client support technicians will work together to create an effective, base-wide e-record 
file structure. (T-1). Permissions must be set to allow authorized access but prevent 
unauthorized access or actions. (T-1). Permissions must be properly maintained through 
staff turn-over, and revoked as needed. (T-1). Where possible, implement the ability to 
manage permissions without requiring elevated system access. 
4.6.2.3.  Base records managers can create e-staging areas to hold e-records. Units will be 
responsible to complete Standard Form 135s, similar to paper records to reflect the e-
records that the base records manager has taken custody of. (T-1). 
4.6.3.  The Air Force Records Information Management System inventory of records and 
folder titles are reflected on the shared drive with a practical naming convention. The location 
of e-records and non-electronic records must be included on the inventory of records. (T-1). It 
is acceptable to have two locations if the records are maintained/exist in multiple 
media/formats. Do not list draft record storage location(s) on inventory of records. 
4.6.4.  Official electronic records drive folders housing essential records must be marked with 
an “E” or the word “Essential” after the folder title (for example, 04 general Correspondence 
E). (T-1) Essential records must be backed up and stored in two geographically separated 
locations to ensure restoration capability during times of disaster. (T-1). 
4.6.5.  Each document in electronic form must be identified sufficiently to enable authorized 
personnel to retrieve, protect, and carry out its disposition. (T-1). 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
37 
4.6.5.1.  External or Physical Labeling. External labeling includes physically placing labels 
on e-record removable media containers as well as the media itself. External labels on e-
records should include the following on the disk container/jacket: security classification, 
disposition instructions (table and rule from the Records Disposition Schedule), originating 
office symbol, title of record, beginning and end dates, software used to create the record, 
and hardware used to produce the record. 
4.6.5.2.  Internal or Electronic Labeling. Internal labeling consists of document and file 
naming within the computer system. Use file-naming conventions that are descriptive, 
consistent, and meaningful. If the file-naming convention incorporates components such 
as project names and dates or versions, they should always retain the same position. For 
example, report_name_year_month_day. Electronic labels located in subdirectories or 
folders must also provide sufficient information to find the files within them. (T-1). Care 
should be taken to ensure that file names and directory organization do not cause a path 
greater than can be handled by the operating system. 
4.6.6.  Ensure proper records cut-off by creating duplicate folders in the inactive directory. 
Drag applicable folders from the active directory to the inactive directory. Once folder is 
moved and verified, delete the records in the active folder. Subdivide each directory by fiscal 
year or calendar year and by when records were collected. 
4.6.6.1.  Inactive e-records may be transferred to offline storage until ready for disposal. 
Inactive e-records transferred to offline storage must be reviewed yearly to ensure proper 
disposition, viability of the media, and accessibility of the content. (T-1). 
4.6.6.2.  When records are archived to off-line storage, record professionals must prepare 
and route a Standard Form 135 to the base records manager to document the transfer and 
provide a record index, and ensure the media label includes the Records Disposition 
Schedule table and rule and the software and version needed to view the records. (T-1). 
The unit must maintain a copy of software to access/view the e-records being stored. 
Commanders will remove transferred e-records from online storage after the transfer has 
been validated. (T-1). 
4.6.7.  Commanders should set up processes to enable records professional to use an “e-file 
box” for temporary storage of records as an alternative if the action officer is unsure of the 
correct placement of documents. Commanders must ensure e-file boxes are monitored and 
filing of records to appropriate location occurs within 48 hours. (T-1). Assign inventory of 
records number “00” to the e-file box so that it shows up at the very top of the e-files area. 
Note: The e-file box is not mandatory. If office of record does not use it, remove from active 
e-files area. 
4.6.8.  Backup. Network support staff should provide back-up of the dedicated official e-
storage area(s) in accordance with the accessibility, confidentiality, and integrity ratings of the 
information and the applicable cybersecurity guidance. As with other controls, the status of the 
information as official records must be considered when determining appropriate back-up 
capabilities. (T-1). Backups will be used for record restoration if a system becomes corrupt or 
records are lost. (T-1). The location of backup media must be part of the local procedures 
addressed in base disaster preparedness plan. (T-1). 
38 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
4.6.8.1.  Duplicate backups are made for essential records and maintained in 
geographically-separate locations. Duplication can be to the same medium as the original 
records. 
4.6.8.2.  The commander will ensure all e-records are properly backed up, and that backups 
are periodically validated and tested. (T-1). 
4.6.9.  The commander will set up processes for indexing and retrieving e-Records. (T-1). The 
primary purpose of indexing is to provide a rapid and reliable method for the automatic 
retrieval of user-selected sets of data. Indexing is vital when managing large holdings of 
records and required for all records with retention greater than five years. Methods to facilitate 
indexing include file naming, folder naming, searchable text, and metadata. 
4.6.10.  Electronically Stored Information retrieval is greatly enhanced by completing the 
record metadata at the time of document creation. Metadata are elements of information that 
answer the questions who, what, where, when, and why regarding electronic records. Metadata 
elements provide administrative, descriptive, and technical information that describe the 
structure and content of electronic records. Metadata elements also provide contextual 
information that explains how electronic records were created, used, managed, and maintained 
and how they are related to other records. This information enables National Archives and 
Records Administration to properly manage, preserve, and provide access to electronic records 
for as long as they are needed. National Archives and Records Administration Bulletin 2015-
04 describes the metadata required when transferring permanent electronic records to National 
Archives 
and 
Records 
Administration 
(https://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/bulletins/2015/2015-04.html). 
4.6.10.1.  When completing metadata, whether transferred to National Archives or not, 
mandatory fields include the title, subject, author, and comments field, if available, to 
include as a minimum the Records Disposition Schedule Table and Rule. 
4.6.10.2.  If an agency provides additional metadata elements, the National Archives will 
accept that metadata as part of the transfer process in addition to the National Archives’ 
minimum metadata requirements. Agencies should notify the National Archives of any 
metadata standards that are in use with permanent electronic records and provide relevant 
schemas, data dictionaries, controlled vocabularies, ontologies, and system indexes at the 
time of transfer. (T-0). 
4.7.  Records Integration.  E-records may be integrated with those on other media. Limit use of 
mixed media (e.g., paper and disks) for parts of the same records. Where similar records that would 
normally be grouped together (e.g., as for a case file) are on mixed media, provide for as much 
integration of the records as possible or practical by converting all the records to a single media 
(e.g., all paper or all electronic). Digitize incoming paper records by using scanners that save the 
documents in a portable document format if signature authentication is not required; reference 
https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance-tables.html#scannedtext. 
If scanning permanent hardcopy records does not meet the National Archives transfer guidance, 
contact the Air Force Records Office. Merge scanned records with their related e-records. 
4.8.  Schedule Disposition.  Schedule the disposition of all e-records as well as related 
documentation and indexes. Records dispositions covering paper records also cover e-records in 
the same series. However, if the e-records are unscheduled, the functional owner for the system 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
39 
must submit an Air Force Form 525 to the base records manager (including those operated for the 
Air Force and Unified and Specified Commands by a contractor) not later than one year after 
implementing the Electronic Record Keeping System. (T-1). 
4.9.  Social Media. 
4.9.1.  Social media includes, but is not limited to the various activities integrating web 
technology, social interaction, and user-generated content. Social media includes blogs, wikis, 
social networks, photo libraries, virtual worlds, location-based services, and video sharing 
sites. Agencies use social media internally and externally to share information, support 
business processes, and connect people to government. 
4.9.2.  Reference Air Force Instruction 35-107, Public Web and Social Communication.

Chapter 5 
RECORDS STAGING AREAS 
5.1.  Records 
Staging 
Areas.  See 
https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/storage-
standards-toolkit for See National Archives standards for base staging areas. Records staging 
areas less than 25,000 cubic feet of records storage comply with File 4: Records Stored in Agency 
Office Space. (T-0).  
5.1.1.  Due to the OMB M-19-21, close base staging facilities by 31 December 2022. (T-0). 
5.1.2.  Beginning 1 January 2023, all other legal transfers of permanent records must be in 
electronic format, to the fullest extent possible, regardless of whether or not the records were 
originally created in electronic formats. (T-0). Digitize permanent records in analog formats 
before transfer to the National Archives in accordance with its regulations and guidance, 
including metadata requirements. Unless granted a waiver or exception to the United States 
Office of Management and Budget and the National Archives mandate, use commercial storage 
facilities to store temporary analog records in inactive status and permanent analog records 
prior to accessioning to the National Archives. (T-0). 
5.2.  Size and Location. 
5.2.1.  At Air Force Installations, record staging areas should not exceed 25,000 cubic feet of 
records storage. An installation or off-base organization may operate only one staging area for 
tenant units or organizations on or near the base. When two or more off-base organizations 
share the same geographic location, but are not located near a federal records center, or it is 
impractical or uneconomical to use the nearest staging area, the base records manager and 
command records manager will facilitate the set-up of a single area for all or most of the 
organizations to use jointly. (T-1). 
5.2.2.  If the installation maintains a facility with over 25,000 cubic feet of records, it is 
required to comply with 36 CFR 1234 (File 2 of https://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/storage-standards-toolkit). If the installation maintains a facility with under 25,000 
cubic feet of records, it is required to comply with 36 CFR 1234 Part 1234.10 – 1234.14 (Files 
4 and 5 of the National Archives Records Storage Standards Toolkit). (T-0). 
5.3.  Staging Area Waivers.  The command records manager may waive the requirements to use 
a staging area when high rent or inadequate space makes a staging area impractical or 
uneconomical. 
5.3.1.  In the event of a waiver by the command records manager, personnel may either keep 
records that are to be retained for eight years or less in available space and equipment or retire 
them to the appropriate federal records center. Send the request for transferring records to a 
federal records center to the Air Force Records Officer. The Air Force Records Officer will 
send the request to the National Archives and Records Administration. (T-0). 
5.3.2.  In the event of a waiver by the command records manager, personnel may retire records 
with a retention period of more than 8 years to the appropriate federal records center. 
5.3.3.  The command records manager may waive the requirement to set up a single staging 
area when unique circumstances exist (such as security precautions, unique tenant 
requirements, off-base activities, limited storage facilities, distance, and so on). If mutually 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
41 
acceptable, other Department of Defense organizations and federal agencies (which are tenants 
of the installation) may use Air Force staging areas. Make a support agreement for tenants who 
wish to have staging area support. The command records manager will send a copy of any 
waivers and a complete justification to the Air Force Records Officer. (T-1). 
5.3.4.  No record staging areas exist for organizations in the National Capital Regional area. If 
these organizations urgently need space for active records, they may transfer inactive records 
with a retention period of at least three years or more remaining to the Washington National 
Records Center. Requests for exceptions to the three-year retention period must be sent to the 
Air Force Records Officer with justification (see Table 6.1, Items 12 and 14, and Note: 3). (T-
1). 
5.4.  Staging Area Procedures. 
5.4.1.  Store both permanent and temporary records with a retention period over 3 years or 
more in staging areas until they are eligible for disposal or retirement to a federal records 
center. Personnel may store large volumes of records with shorter retention periods in staging 
areas if they use space and equipment economically, and if the commander and the base records 
manager agree. Do not store active records in staging areas. Consider records rarely used but 
kept indefinitely (e.g., installation management records and equipment historical files) as 
inactive and store them in staging areas. Records with short retention periods may be kept in 
available space and equipment until they are eligible for destruction. 
5.4.2.  Management of the Staging Areas. The base records manager manages the installation 
staging area except at Air Intelligence Agency, National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 
and Air Force Technical Applications Center. The base records manager may ask for labor 
assistance from organizations using the staging area. Restrict the time that personnel spend in 
staging areas to the minimum necessary to receive, search for, and dispose of records. 
5.4.3.  Transfer of Records. The organization transferring records to a staging area prepares 
the Standard Form 135 in the Air Force Records Information Management System. The base 
records manager uses the Air Force Records Information Management System to manage, 
accept, and retrieve staging area records. The base records manager will place a copy of the 
Standard Form 135 in the first box of each transfer before putting on shelf. 
5.4.4.  Disposing of Records. The base records manager destroys or restores eligible records 
in the staging area, and reviews the shipment lists in the locator and disposition file before the 
end of each calendar or fiscal year for records ready for disposition. 
5.4.4.1.  Retire records having a retention period of more than 8 years coming from units 
and organizations inactivated or moved from the installation to the appropriate federal 
records center according to Chapter 7. 
5.4.4.2.  Avoid numerous small shipments to keep postal and handling costs to a minimum 
when retiring records for installations or separate organizations. Federal records centers 
normally accept only records with 3 years or more retention remaining. Washington 
National Records Center does not store records scheduled for destruction in less than 1 
year. 
5.4.4.2.1.  The federal records center considers exceptions to the 3-year rule on an 
individual basis and only after approval has been granted through records management 
42 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
channels to the Air Force Records Officer. For tenant units’ records stored in a host 
staging area, the tenant records manager works with the host records manager to 
dispose of tenant’s records in staging areas. Resources permitting, the host records 
manager includes all material tenants want to retire in combined shipments to the 
federal records center. When resources are insufficient, the host records manager 
should request resources (personnel, boxes, etc.) from the tenants; however, any 
assistance by tenants for the host’s request is voluntary. 
5.4.4.2.2.  For large volumes or several tenants, the host records manager may ask the 
tenant to help in disposing or preparing the tenant’s shipments. When tenant’s records 
are part of a host combined shipment to a federal records center, separate Standard 
Form 135 (or Archives and Records Centers Information System equivalent) must be 
prepared for each unit and include the unit’s designation in item 5 of the Standard Form 
135 with the parent Major Command in parentheses. (T-1). The host records manager 
gives the tenants involved in the shipment either a copy of the Standard Form 135 
receipt (showing transfer numbers, location numbers, and so on) or the transfer and 
location number for the tenants to add to their copies of the Standard Form 135 that 
were used to transfer the records to the staging area. If the unit has been inactivated, 
the host records manager gives a copy of the Standard Form 135 to the parent Major 
Command of the inactivated unit. 
5.4.5.  Locator and Disposition File. This file consists of original Standard Form 135 (and/or 
attached continuation sheets) arranged by the headquarters, installation, activity, or unit whose 
records are in the staging area. These files also contains the certificates of destruction for 
destroyed classified material. 
5.4.6.  Charge Out File. Use Optional Form 11, Reference Request-Federal Records Centers, 
or Air Force Form 614 or Air Force Form 614a, to keep track of loaned material. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020

Chapter 6 
DISPOSING AND TRANSFERRING RECORDS 
6.1.  Disposing of Records. 
6.1.1.  Authority and Implementation. 
6.1.1.1.  In addition to the guidelines in this instruction, follow the Air Force Records 
Disposition Schedule, which incorporates the dispositions from the National Archives and 
Records Administration General Records Schedules. 
6.1.1.2.  Do not make personal decisions to destroy Air Force records. Exception: Dispose 
of special intelligence records per Air Force Manual 14-403, Sensitive Compartmented 
Information Security and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Systems 
Cybersecurity and Governance and Air Force Instruction 36-2608, Military Personnel 
Records System, for records that are included in the military personnel master record. 
6.1.1.3.  Use destruction methods and procedures in Air Force Instruction 16-1404, Air 
Force Information Security Program, as authority for disposing of classified documentary 
records according to agency procedures. Exception: Destroy non-record classified 
material and other temporary material, such as extra copy files and publications, and other 
materials excluded from the definition of records, as soon as their intended purposes are 
served. Exception: Dispose of special intelligence records per AFMAN 14-403 and AFI 
36-2608 for records that are included in the military personnel master record. 
6.1.1.4.  When disposition schedules and standards change because of new requirements, 
procedures, and methods, follow these rules: 
6.1.1.4.1.  When a changed schedule increases the retention period, apply the standard 
to all records (including inactive and cutoff records) of that description, regardless of 
where they are maintained or when they were created. 
6.1.1.4.2.  When a changed schedule reduces the retention period, apply the standard 
retroactively. Exception: If specific instructions are provided with the change in 
retention, follow those even if contrary to the general case. 
6.1.1.4.3.  Records freeze is a suspension of the legal disposition. Frozen records are 
records whose scheduled disposition has been temporarily suspended because of 
special circumstances that alter the administrative, legal, or fiscal value of the records. 
In response to a notice on a records freeze, identify affected records and information in 
units (including inventories of records and information systems, local storage areas, 
Federal Records Centers, and other areas where affected records and information are 
stored). (T-1). These actions will ensure that any potentially responsive record is 
preserved regardless of its physical location. 
6.1.2.  Retention and Retirement Standards. 
6.1.2.1.  Records must be identified in Air Force Records Disposition Schedule; use Table 
6.1. to cut off records identified in the Records Disposition Schedule. Exceptions: 
identified in this instruction or in the Records Disposition Schedule. (T-1). 
44 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
6.1.2.2.  Records with a retention period of more than 3 years but less than 8 years are 
transferred to a base staging area. Organizations coordinate this through the base records 
manager and prepare a Standard Form 135, instructions on how to complete this form can 
be found at http://www.archives.gov/frc/records-transfer.html or in the Help Content 
in the Air Force Records Information Management System. 
6.1.2.3.  Retire Air Force personnel records with a retention period of 8 years or more to 
the National Archives as specified on its web site. Exception: The Air Force Records 
Disposition Schedule may specify another federal records center (such as the National 
Personnel Record Center in St. Louis, MO, for personnel and medical records); if so, retire 
them where specified. Federal records center addresses and instructions are found at 
http://www.archives.gov/frc. 
6.1.2.4.  Tables in the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule include standards for cutoff, 
setting up inactive files, retention periods, and specific instructions as to the organizational 
levels at which the disposition instructions apply. In most cases, however, only general 
disposition instructions exist, such as “destroy after 3 months,” “2 years,” “10 years,” 
“when superseded,” and so forth. Regardless of the disposition standards, unless otherwise 
stated, retention periods begin after the file cutoff date, rather than the dates of individual 
records in a file. If using SharePoint® or a Records Management Application, then 
retention periods begin with the dates of individual records in a file. 
6.1.2.5.  When Staging Areas close or reach capacity: 
6.1.2.5.1.  When a base closes, a staging area is eliminated, or a staging area reaches 
capacity, the base records manager must notify the Air Force Records Officer through 
the command records manager of records that are disposable within 8 years. (T-1). 
6.1.2.5.2.  The Air Force Records Officer will call appropriate command records 
manager to determine if a nearby Air Force base has room in its staging area for 
consolidation of records storage. 
6.1.2.5.3.  If storing records at another Air Force base is not an option, the Air Force 
Records Officer will contact National Archives and Records Administration, Office of 
Federal Records Center Operations to determine which regional record center near the 
closing base will retire/accept the temporary records. Due to the 31 December 2022 
deadline in the OMB M-19-21, consider National Archives-approved commercial 
storage, 
https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/storage-standards-
toolkit/commercial-records-storage-facilities-by-state. 
6.1.2.6.  Retention and Retirement Standards for Air Force Activities. 
6.1.2.6.1.  When the Records Disposition Schedule does not specify a location in 
column C of the table, the standard applies Air Force-wide.

Notes: 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  
Command records managers may authorize a temporary 
extension to disposition standards in the Air Force Records 
Disposition Schedule pending processing of request as indicated 
in paragraph 6.1.2.6.4. This also applies to other governments’ 
laws or agreements with the United States, which specify longer 
retention periods. If a temporary extension is granted by the 
command records manager, retain the records and send the 
following information immediately by letter through channels to 
the Air Force Records Officer: 
1.1.  
Description of records and prescribing directives; table and rule 
from the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule covering 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
49 
records; length of requested extension; volume of records 
involved; reasons for extension. 
1.2. 
 A statement of the current and proposed physical location of the 
records, including information on whether the records have been 
or will be transferred to one or more federal records centers. The 
Air Force Records Officer will advise the command records 
manager of final action. If the request is disapproved, follow the 
disposition criteria in the appropriate Table and Rule. If 
approved, the command records manager issues an authorization 
letter to the requesting activity for attachment to the related 
inventory of records. 
2.  
Transitory and reading files and other large volumes of three to 
six month retention files are cut off at the end of each month. 
When volume or other circumstances justify cut off records with 
a retention period of 1 year or less on a daily, weekly, monthly, 
or semiannual basis, and retain for the prescribed retention 
period. 
3. 
 If office space is urgently needed for current records, before the 
retention period within the office expires, see paragraph 5.3.4. 
4.  
Comply with chapter 7.1.1. before retiring classified records to a 
staging area or records center. 
5.  
If there is no staging area, retain and destroy in the current files 
area. 
6.  
Retain small volumes of 2-year to 8-year retention in the current 
files area until eligible for disposal or retirement and if the office 
does not need additional space or equipment. A waiver from the 
base records manager is not required, however, the base records 
manager should be notified. 
7. 
Transfer records prior to 31 December 2021 to the fullest extent 
possible. Due to the OMB M-19-21, the National Archives will 
no longer accept hardcopy records after 31 December 2022, and 
base staging facilities must be closed by 31 December 2022. (T-
0). Possible options after 2022 include digitizing the hardcopy 
records or shipping the hardcopy records to a National Archives-
approved commercial vendor. 
6.1.2.6.2.  If there is no staging area or office is not in close proximity to an Air Force 
installation having a staging area, transfer records with a 3-year to 8-year retention to 
the regional federal records center serving the area, provided the command records 
manager or agency records manager and National Archives and Records 
Administration approve, and the records center agrees to accept the records. Under the 
same circumstances for 9-year to permanent records, retain in current files area for 2 
years after cutoff, then retire (through the organization’s records manager) to 
Washington National Records Center or other designated records centers. 
6.1.2.6.3.  If the office needs space for current records, transfer noncurrent records to 
the staging area sooner, if the base records manager approves. 
50 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
6.1.2.6.4.  The command records manager may approve an extension of retention 
period for records needed for longer than 2 years after cutoff because of frequent 
reference. Annotate the related Standard Form 135 with the new information. Send 
requests for extension to the Air Force Records Officer, who must get National 
Archives and Records Administration’s approval for extension of retention period. (T-
0). Place records authorized for indefinite retention at the installation (such as certain 
civil engineering records and equipment historical files), which are relatively inactive 
and have infrequent reference in the local staging area by mutual agreement between 
the accumulating office and the records manager responsible for the supervision of the 
staging area. 
6.1.2.6.5.  Hold local series not retrievable to Washington National Records Center or 
National Personnel Record Center. 
6.1.3.  Upon receipt or creation of unscheduled records, procedures in paragraph 2.2.9.4 must 
be followed. (T-1). If the records take up file space that is needed for active material, the base 
records manager will facilitate the transfer to a staging area until final disposition is approved. 
(T-1). Upon transfer of unscheduled records to a staging area, send a copy of the Standard 
Form 135, to the base records manager. 
6.1.4.  Emergency Retirement. In hostile or potentially hostile areas, during war, or when war 
seems imminent, obtain agreement among the affected commander, the base records manager, 
the command records manager, Air Force Records Officer, and National Archives and Records 
Administration to retire records with a retention period of more than 2 years to the proper 
federal records center at any time after cutoff if: 
6.1.4.1.  Records may be destroyed by hostile or potentially hostile action and the records 
are valuable enough to save until the normal retention period ends. Offices retiring records 
make duplicate copies, if needed, for frequent reference to avoid harm to the unit’s mission 
or place an unrealistic research and reference burden on the federal records centers. 
6.1.4.2.  The records take space urgently needed for military purposes and personnel do 
not use them often enough to warrant continued local storage. 
6.1.4.3.  If none of the conditions in paragraphs 6.1.4.1 and 6.1.4.2 apply, keep the records 
and retire them at the times specified in paragraph 6.1.2 and Table 6.1., or, in an 
emergency, according to paragraph 6.1.5.2. 
6.1.4.4.  Do not retire material that is designated to be kept for less than 2 years unless it is 
of sufficient importance in protecting the legal or financial rights of individuals and the Air 
Force. Requests to destroy these short term records must be approved by the Air Force 
Records Officer before destruction. (T-1). 
6.1.5.  Emergency Disposal of Records. Dispose of records without regard to the Records 
Disposition Schedule if an emergency arises, as follows: 
6.1.5.1.  A Hazard to Health, Life, or Property. A command records manager who believes 
that records have become a hazard to health, life, or property notifies the Air Force Records 
Officer of the nature of the hazard, the kind and quantity of material involved, and its 
location. The Air Force Records Officer will notify National Archives and Records 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
51 
Administration and upon National Archives approval, Air Force Records Officer directs 
immediate destruction or removal of the material. (T-0). 
6.1.5.1.1.  Nitrocellulose-Based Film. If any radarscope, aerial, or other still or motion-
picture film on a nitrocellulose base deteriorates to the point where it is soft and sticky, 
is emitting a noxious odor, contains gas bubbles, or has turned to an acrid powder, and 
the Office of Primary Responsibility determines that it is a menace to health, life, or 
property, the command records manager may eliminate the hazard without prior 
approval. 
6.1.5.1.2.  The command records manager requests the Office of Primary 
Responsibility remove the film from inhabited buildings as soon as possible; destroy it 
in a way to save its silver content, or if the quantity is not large enough to justify saving 
its silver content, arrange for authorized disposal in approved landfills. Submerge the 
film to be burned in water-filled drums, and move it to a remote spot that fire authorities 
have approved for burning. If possible, burn one reel at a time, but never more than 25 
pounds. Do not burn the film in a furnace or other confined space to avoid dangerous 
gases; within 30 calendar days of film destruction, complete and send a report to the 
Air Force Records Officer describing the film and stating when, where, and how the 
destruction took place. Assign Interagency Report Control Number 1095-NAR-AR to 
this report. 
6.1.5.2.  State of War, Threatened War, or Hostile Action outside the United States. When 
an appropriate authority determines that war or hostile action seems imminent, destroy 
records in the custody of a commander outside the territorial limits of the Continental 
United States without regard to disposition standards in the Air Force Records Disposition 
Schedule and without prior approval if these situations exist: retaining the records would 
be damaging to the interest of the United States; records take up space urgently needed for 
military purposes; records are without sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other 
value to warrant their continued preservation under the threat. 
6.1.5.2.1.  If the records are considered valuable enough to warrant preservation despite 
the threat, retire according to paragraph 6.1.4. Follow destruction procedures in 
AFI16-1404 when emergency destruction is required. 
6.1.5.2.2.  When records are destroyed in an emergency, provide the following 
information in writing to the Air Force Records Officer: organization name, location, 
and commander; record description and authentication date; record security 
classification (if known); place and date of destruction; and reason for the destruction. 
6.1.6.  Damage to or Unauthorized Disposition of Records. Disposing of records without 
authorization involves removing them from Air Force custody or destroying or altering them 
without regard to the schedules in the Records Disposition Schedule. Personnel, to include 
contractors employed by the Department of the Air Force, shall not conceal, remove, mutilate, 
obliterate or destroy records without proper authority. This paragraph is punitive and 
constitutes a violation of Article 92(1), Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is applicable 
to Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard when in a Title 10 federal 
status. ANG members may be subject to an equivalent article under a state military justice 
code. Federal civilian employees and contractors may face disciplinary and/or criminal action. 
(T-0). Penalties for Violation: An individual may be held criminally liable for concealment, 
52 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
removal, mutilation, obliteration, or destruction of records in accordance with the provisions 
of 18 United States Code § 2071. An AF employee may be subject to fines or imprisonment 
or both. (T-0). 
6.1.6.1.  Upon discovering unauthorized loss, damage, or destruction of records, the 
commander and the organization responsible for the records must make a reasonable effort 
to find, restore, or reconstruct them. (T-1). 
6.1.6.1.1.  Restoring Records. Users who believe they can save damaged records 
should contact the base records manager who will contact the base disaster planning 
office, follow procedures in National Archives and Records Administration’s Essential 
Records Guide, or other material in local libraries, or consult with a local restoration 
company. The command records manager will promptly report the quantity and type 
of records damaged, source of damage (fire, flood, and so on), extent of damage and 
an assessment of whether restoration efforts are practical. (T-1). 
6.1.6.1.2.  Reconstruct records from extra copies or from other records containing the 
same information. 
6.1.6.1.3.  Disposal. If restoration or reconstruction of damaged records is not practical 
and the Air Force Records Officer has concurred, the command records manager will 
direct the immediate disposal of the damaged records. (T-1). Command records 
managers must identify them as lost or destroyed records on Standard Form 135 when 
they retire records of the same period to a staging area or federal records center. (T-1). 
6.1.6.2.  Reporting. Records Managers (RM) must provide an initial notification of all 
improper removal, defacing, alteration, or destruction of records to the command records 
manager within three duty days of discovery. Upon receipt, the command records manager 
will provide the initial notification information to the Air Force Records Officer. Records 
Managers should use the template located on Air Force Records Management Community 
of Practice upon submission of final report to the command records manager. (T-1). The 
final report must include a (1) a complete description of the records including the volume 
and dates; (2) the organization, unit, or office maintaining the records; (3) a statement of 
the exact circumstances surrounding the incident; (4) a statement of the safeguards 
established to prevent further instances of record loss; and (5) when appropriate, details of 
the actions taken to salvage, retrieve, or reconstruct the records. (T-0). Validation of 
training completion for all involved in the chain of custody is required when reporting lost 
or damaged records. The command records manager provides the final report to the Air 
Force Records Officer. The Air Force Records Officer in-turn will notify the National 
Archives within twenty duty days of receipt of the final report. 
6.1.6.2.1.  For lost records involving information on Air Force members, insert a 
placeholder to alert future records professionals on the loss, notify the unit (if unaware) 
which originated the records about the loss, notify the members’ affected by the loss 
(contact Air Force Personnel Center for last known home address of separated 
members). 
6.1.6.2.2.  Penalties. U.S. Criminal Code 18 USC § 2071 lists penalties for willfully 
and unlawful destroying, damaging or altering records. The maximum penalty is a 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
53 
$2,000 fine, 3 years in prison, or both; loss of office, and disqualification from holding 
any US office. 
6.1.7.  Authorized Methods of Disposal. 
6.1.7.1.  Report large volumes of records for disposal to the Defense Logistics Agency 
Disposition Services 
6.1.7.1.1.  Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services decides whether to destroy 
or sell the records as waste paper. Contracts for recycling or selling these records must 
prohibit their future use as records or documents. (T-1). DoD 5400.07-M_AFMAN 33-
302 and AFI 33-332 contain disposal procedures for records exempt from public 
disclosure. Recycle or sell nonpaper records (film, plastic recordings, and so on) in the

government, public, or private individual by any means approved for classified information 
or by any means that would make it difficult to recognize or reconstruct the information. 
6.1.7.2.1.  Unclassified material is considered destroyed when disposed of in a waste 
container and/or recycled, or placed in Data Distribution System according to the Air 
Force or local procedures. 
6.1.7.2.2.  Records on electronic or similar media are considered destroyed when 
erased, degaussed and reused. 
6.1.7.3.  Record donation to an eligible government (including a foreign government), 
organization, institution, corporation, or individual must have prior approval through 
command records manager, the Air Force Records Officer, and the National Archives. (T-
1). The command records manager requests approval through the Air Force Records 
Officer, submitting a description of the records and organization that owns them. The Air 
Force Records Officer requests the transfer through the National Archives; the following 
conditions must be met: 
6.1.7.3.1.  The applicant agrees not to sell the records as records or documents. (T-1). 
6.1.7.3.2.  The applicant agrees to take the records without cost to the Government. (T-
1). 
6.1.7.3.3.  The records are not classified or do not contain information that laws or 
regulations prohibit or that would hurt the public interest. (T-1). 
6.1.7.3.4.  A foreign government has an official interest, and is not otherwise prohibited 
by Air Force directives such as (but not limited to) Instruction 16-201, Air Force 
Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program; AFI 16-1404. (T-1). 
6.1.7.3.5.  An individual or commercial business shows that the records are necessary 
for managing properties acquired from the Government. (T-1). 
54

instructions from the Air Force Records Officer through the command records manager. 
6.1.8.3.  Foreign Language Records. Maintain and dispose of records written in foreign 
languages in the same manner as similar material written in English. Exception: Maintain 
and dispose of material obtained through intelligence collection efforts in the same manner

6.1.8.3.1.  If foreign language records are translated into English during the course of 
normal business practices, file a copy of the translation (or a summary for lengthy 
material) with the material translated.

Eyes Only” to non-Air Force personnel (except Army Air Force Exchange Service 
personnel) without the approval of the originator, successor, or a higher authority. Remove, 
destroy, or rephrase the information that originally made the document restrictive and 
delete the markings before retiring it to a federal records center or the National Archives. 
Unit records professionals will monitor the review of these records to ensure retention of 
long-term, permanent, or those of historical value. (T-1). 
6.1.9.  Disposition Procedures for Records of Units and Activities Changing Status. 
6.1.9.1.  Redesignation or Reorganization of Units and Activities. 
6.1.9.1.1.  When the Air Force redesignates or reorganizes a unit or activity with a 
change in function or mission, cut off the files on the day before the redesignation or 
reorganization and ensure that the successor unit or activity maintains them as a 
separate entity. 
6.1.9.1.2.  Destroy or retire files according to the program action directive and the 
tables and rules in the Records Disposition Schedule. 
6.1.9.1.2.1.  When the Air Force redesignates or reorganizes a unit or activity with 
no change in function or mission, maintain the files and cut off in the same manner 
and at the same time as if no change of status had occurred. Exception: All files 
that are created after redesignation display the new designation. 
6.1.9.1.2.2.  When files for a reorganized or redesignated unit or activity are retired, 
mark the Standard Form 135 to show the organizational change. 
6.1.9.2.  Inactivation of Units and Activities. The term inactivation includes 
discontinuance, disbandment, and reduction to zero strength. 
6.1.9.2.1.  When the organization is not transferring responsibilities, destroy records as 
permitted by the Records Disposition Schedule, transfer records to the appropriate 
staging area until they are eligible for disposal, and retire records with a remaining 
retention time of more than 3 years to Washington National Records Center unless 
required to be stored at another organization or records center. 
6.1.9.2.1.1.  If the organization has no staging area or is being inactivated, send a 
list of records and volumes through records management channels to the Air Force 
Records Officer 
6.1.9.2.1.2.  The Air Force Records Officer queries the National Archives as to 
which federal records center to send the records and notifies the command records 
manager of the appropriate disposition. 
6.1.9.2.2.  When an organization transfers responsibilities, it must transfer all records 
to the successor organization to preserve their administrative origin (Exception: When 
needed to support a particular transaction, event, or function.). (T-1). Use Standard 
Form 135 or memorandum to document the transfer of records (Exception: When 
inappropriate such as for personnel folders). 
56 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
6.1.9.3.  Installations Placed on Inactive or Standby Status. Keep records required for the 
continued maintenance of an installation placed on an inactive or standby status at the 
installation. Dispose of the records according to the Records Disposition Schedule and the 
special information Base Realignment and Closure provide on base closures. 
6.1.9.4.  Units Alerted for Overseas Movement. Before a unit moves to or from the 
Continental United States, records destruction shall be completed within the limits 
established by the Records Disposition Schedule. (T-1). 
6.1.9.4.1.  If there is no staging area at the unit’s last permanent station, the unit 
requests a transfer to the federal records center. 
6.1.9.4.2.  If the staging area cannot receive classified material, transfer it to any 
organization that the commander considers appropriate, notify the command records 
manager of its location, and retire records to the federal records center designated by 
the National Archives and Records Administration. 
6.1.9.5.  Transferred Units. When the Air Force transfers a unit from one Major Command 
to another, or from one place to another, the unit retains its current records; when a unit is 
transferred without personnel and equipment, it transfers only those records that the unit’s 
new commander considers essential. The unit disposes of the remaining records in one of 
the following ways: retires them to an appropriate federal records center, keeps them in the 
staging area of the former installation, or destroys them according to the Records 
Disposition Schedule. Exception: When a unit leaves its former responsibility or mission 
to another unit, the new unit may keep any required records, if the command records 
manager approves. The unit keeps these records intact to preserve their administrative 
origin, except when another organization needs them to support a particular transaction, 
event, or function. 
6.1.9.6.  Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Units. 
6.1.9.6.1.  Air Force Reserve Units entering Regular Air Force active duty. Cut off 
record sets of orders the day before entering active duty status. Other active records the 
unit requires while on active duty status will accompany the unit. (T-1). Transfer 
remaining records with the record sets of orders to a staging area designated by the 
Reserve command records manager for retention or retirement, or destroy the records 
before the unit enters active duty status according to the Records Disposition Schedule. 
6.1.9.6.2.  Air Force Reserve Units Changing Back to Reserve Status. Cut off record 
sets of orders and other records that a Reserve unit created or collected during Regular 
Air Force active duty on the last day of active duty status. 
6.1.9.6.2.1.  The command records manager with oversight of the reserve unit while 
it was on active duty status will select a staging area to receive records for retention 
or retirement, or will direct destruction according to the Records Disposition 
Schedule. (T-1). 
6.1.9.6.2.2.  If a unit changes back to Reserve status during the same calendar year 
in which it entered Regular Air Force active duty, remove the record sets of orders 
issued before active duty status from the staging area and continue the same series 
with the normal cutoff as specified by Headquarters Air Force Reserve. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
57 
6.1.9.6.3.  Air National Guard Units Entering on Regular Air Force Active Duty. 
Active records that the unit requires while on active duty status accompany the unit. 
Cut off remaining records and dispose of or retire them according to appropriate Air 
National Guard regulations before the unit enters active duty status. 
6.1.9.6.4.  Air National Guard Units Changing Back to State Control. Cut off records 
created or collected by the Guard unit during Regular Air Force active duty on the day 
before active duty ends. Transfer the records to a local staging area and notify the 
command records manager. Retain, retire, or dispose of the records as instructed by the 
command records manager and the unit’s State Headquarters. 
6.2.  Transferring Records to the National Archives and Records Administration. 
6.2.1.  The act of initiating the transfer to the National Archives of records already scheduled 
as permanent is called a scheduled transfer. The Archivist of the United States accepts for 
deposit with the National Archives any Air Force records that the Archivist decides have 
sufficient administrative, historical, or other value to keep. Normally the transfer of Air Force 
records to the National Archives is from the federal records centers (known as the Annual 
Move). However, an organization may offer certain records for direct transfer to the National 
Archives by submitting a request within the Electronic Records Archives system (known as a 
direct offer). The Office of Primary Responsibility, the Air Force Records Officer, and the 
National Archives arrange the transfer and set up the conditions for using the material. The 
National Archives determines the kind of records it will accept and whether to retire them to 
the federal records center or transfer them directly to the National Archives. 
6.2.2.  Transfer copies of existing reference material, such as data sheets, continuities, review 
sheets, scripts, or indexes for identifying and using audio-visual records with these materials.

6.2.7.  Motion Pictures. The federal records centers and the National Archives normally do not 
accept Air Force-owned, motion picture records on nitrocellulose-based film because of the 
potential hazards (see paragraph 6.1.5.1.1.). If Air Force organizations having nitrate motion 
pictures determine they are valuable enough to maintain at records centers or National 
Archives, they must convert the nitrate film to safety acetate film. (T-0). Before converting the 
film, the Air Force Records Officer must obtain National Archives approval that the converted 
film will be accepted. (T-0). Normally, the minimum number of copies of motion picture film 
necessary for security, duplication, and use by National Archives is the negative (original or 
duplicate) that (in descending order of priority): most nearly represents the original capture of 
actual events, best represents the edited production of actual events and best represents the 
58 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
edited production for which action is staged, with a master positive print and one projection 
print for actual use. Note: In most cases, the projection print is the negative after laboratory 
cutting, composite negative of sound film, the master fine-grain positive print, and one other 
print. 
6.3.  Transferring Records to Other Agencies and Organizations. 
6.3.1.  Intra-Air Force Transfer. Permit transfer of files or records from one Air Force 
organization to another only when retiring them to a staging area or other repository according 
to the procedures in this instruction, an organization that is changing status transfers them 
according to paragraph 6.1.9, or a function responsibility transfers from one unit to another. 
When major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting units transfer 
responsibilities, they transfer the active records relating to that responsibility at the same time. 
The receiving major command, field operating agency, or direct reporting unit ensures that the 
records are properly identified on the files plans. Use Standard Form 135 to transfer records, 
and send a copy to the losing and gaining command records managers. According to 36 CFR 
1234, Section, 1228.122, do not transfer records from one Government agency to another 
without written approval by the National Archives. (T-0). 
6.3.1.1.  Send written requests for exceptions to the Air Force Records Officer before 
transferring or loaning Air Force records. Request should include a concise description of 
the records for transfer (with the volume in cubic feet), restrictions on using records, name 
and location of the receiving agency (with the names of the persons who will use the 
records and their intended use), name and location of the organization transferring the 
records, reason for the transfer (with justification for transfer of records more than 5 years 
old) and why the transfer is in the best interest of the Government. Note: Restrictions 
because of a law, executive order, or Air Force decision continue after a transfer, although 
the organization receiving the records may agree to remove the restrictions. 
6.3.1.2.  The Air Force Records Officer receives authority from the National Archives for 
transferring Air Force records to another federal agency in instances other than those cited 
above. 
6.3.2.  Transfer Outside of Government Agencies. The Air Force Records Officer gets 
approval from the National Archives to transfer records to organizations outside of the Federal 
Government. Follow transfer request procedures in paragraph 6.3.1 (T-0). 
6.4.  Getting Records from a Records Center, Staging Area, or Other Organizations. 
6.4.1.  Records can be retrieved from a federal records center or Staging Area by the 
organization that created the records, successor organizations, higher headquarters, or other 
organizations designated by the Office of Primary Responsibility or those the records manager 
chooses. To request inactive records from an Air Force organization, write directly to the 
organization to request records. 
6.4.2.  Washington National Records Center keeps a list of persons authorized to request, 
receive, and pick up classified and unclassified records stored at the Washington National 
Records Center. Major command, field operating agency and direct reporting unit records 
managers compile these lists annually and provide security clearance information for those 
individuals requesting classified records to the Air Force Records Officer for processing. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
59 
Washington National Records Center requires the Air Force to submit annual 
update/verification of individuals authorized to pick up and withdraw records from the center. 
6.4.3.  Authorizations at base-level are restricted to the base records manager and one alternate. 
To preclude interruption of access, Washington National Records Center authorizations are 
provided to the supporting command records manager before the end of the fiscal year. This 
access is for Washington National Records Center only and does not affect either personnel or 
medical record retrieval. 
6.4.4.  The base records manager or the Office of Primary Responsibility will approve loan 
requests for retired records only after verifying the records center or staging area can meet the 
loan request, the loan will not subject the records to abnormal risk of loss or damage nor slow 
down other business of a higher priority. (T-1). 
6.4.5.  Use Archives and Records Centers Information System to make reference requests in 
order to recall records or use records from any federal records center. Do not send, E-mail, fax, 
or deliver an Optional Form 11 to a federal records center. Instead, use the information on the 
Optional Form 11 and input into the Archives and Records Centers Information System. Use 
Optional Form 11 to recall records or use records from any staging area. 
6.4.6.  Use Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to obtain information 
from military personnel records. The Standard Form 180 also lists the correct mailing 
addresses and location of military personnel records. 
6.4.6.1.  Send requests for transcripts to the Community College of the Air Force, 
CCAF/DESS, 100 S. Turner Blvd., Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base AL 36114 or via the 
Internet at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/transcripts.asp. 
6.4.6.2.  When Standard Form 180 is not available or the location of the personnel records 
is unknown, provide as much of this information as possible to National Personnel Records 
Center (Military Personnel Records). 
6.4.6.2.1.  The names military personnel used during service (last, first, middle). 
6.4.6.2.2.  Branch of service, all service numbers and Social Security Number. 
6.4.6.2.3.  Date and place of birth. 
6.4.6.2.4.  If deceased, date and status at death (active duty, retired, etc.). 
6.4.6.2.5.  Dates of service (active, Reserve, and National Guard). 
6.4.6.2.6.  Present status of the individual (active, Reserve, Fleet Reserve, deceased, 
etc.). 
6.4.6.2.7.  Complete name and address of the requester, including business and home 
telephone. 
6.4.6.3.  For the National Personnel Record Center (Military Personnel Records) to provide 
the best service, limit telephone requests to urgent or emergency matters; mail requests 
instead. 
6.4.6.4.  Use National Personnel Record Center’s customer service number (314) 801-0800 
during regular working hours (0700 to 1700 Central Standard Time) and emergencies, 
https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center. 
60 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
6.5.  Restrictions on Release of Information.  Service personnel may obtain almost any 
information from their own records. The next of kin, if the veteran has died, and authorized federal 
offices with an official purpose, may obtain most types of information from a military service or 
medical record. Other requesters must have a release signed by the veteran. (T-1). 
6.5.1.  Using Standard Form 127, Request for Official Personnel Folder (Separated 
Employee). Use Standard Form 127 to request the National Personnel Record Center send 
civilian personnel records of former military personnel. Send two copies to the federal records 
center. 
6.5.2.  Use DD Form 877, Request for Medical/Dental Records or Information, to request 
medical and dental records from the National Personnel Record Center. 
6.6.  Removing Records Permanently.  Borrowed records may not be permanently removed 
from any federal records center or staging area without written approval of the base records 
manager, or the command records manager for inactivated organizations. Send written approval 
to the federal records center or base records manager with Optional Form 11 for the records. If the 
records center retires the records again at a later date, prepare a new set of Standard Form 135s 
and handle as a new retirement action. 
6.7.  Returning Borrowed Records.  The commander must ensure borrowers return records to 
the records storage or staging area. Borrowed records from a staging area will be returned within 
10 duty days unless justification is provided by the unit to the base records manager. (T-1). 
6.8.  Loaning Already Borrowed Records.  Borrowers do not normally loan out records they 
have already borrowed from a federal records center or staging area. If borrowers must provide 
papers from borrowed files to other agencies or offices they: (T-1). 
6.8.1.  Promptly notify the federal records center or base records manager. (T-1). 
6.8.2.  State the reasons for needing to loan out the borrowed records. (T-1). 
6.8.3.  Describe the records in question. (T-1). 
6.8.4.  Provide an approximate date of return. (T-1). 
6.8.5.  Do not lend official Air Force files to activities outside Air Force without approval from 
the Air Force Records Officer and the National Archives. (T-1). 
6.8.6.  Obtain a signature for release on a Standard Form 135. (T-1). 
6.8.7.  Preferably, make copies for the other interested person. (T-1). 
6.9.  Addressing Inquiries.  To keep rerouting to a minimum, send inquiries on retired 
organization and installation records directly to the federal records center maintaining the records 
for the period involved. 
6.10.  Withdrawing Records by Reactivated Installations and Units.  Federal records centers 
and base records managers approve requests for records by reactivated units or installations to 
assist administration if the loan initially lasts for a 3-month period, with the privilege of renewal. 
The federal records center or base records manager may recall the loan at any time.

7.1.1.  Shipment of Classified Records. The Commander reviews all classified records before 
retiring them to a staging area or federal records center to determine whether they can be 
downgraded or declassified according to AFI 16-1404. 
7.1.2.  Review of Classified Records Prior to Shipment. The Commander certifies on the 
Standard Form 135 (or equivalent field in the Archives and Records Centers Information 
System) that the downgrading or declassification review took place and puts new classification 
marks on the records. 
7.2.  Methods of Shipment. 
7.2.1.  Use the most frugal means of shipment when shipping records to any federal records 
center. Motor or rail freight shipment satisfies this requirement within Continental United 
States. When rapid transportation is required, use parcel service. If using parcel service, follow 
the weight and size restrictions and other procedures in Department of Defense Manual 4525.8-
M_Air Force Manual 33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual. Ship TOP SECRET, SECRET and 
CONFIDENTIAL material according to AFI 16-1404 and Department of Defense Manual 
5200.01-V1-4, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). (T-0). Use local Transportation 
Management Office for large, unclassified shipments. For shipments of 50 boxes or more, call 
the federal records center to schedule a shipping date and instruct the commercial carrier to 
contact the federal records center 24 hours before delivery. Write this instruction on the bill of 
lading. 
7.2.2.  Washington National Records Center. The Washington National Records Center 
provides records management services to headquarters and field offices of federal agencies 
located in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. See 
https://www.archives.gov/suitland for information on using the Center. 
7.3.  For Official Use Only Files.  Do not separate records and files carrying the For Official Use 
Only protective marking. Pack and ship them with unclassified records. 
7.4.  Information for using Standard Form 135.  See https://www.archives.gov/frc/forms/sf-
135-instructions 
7.5.  Using Archives and Records Centers Information System to ship boxes of records to 
and pull boxes from a federal records center.  Do not send, email, fax, or deliver a Standard 
Form 135 to a federal records center. Instead, use the information on the Standard Form 135 and 
input into the Archives and Records Centers Information System. Account application forms, 
online

Chapter 8 
AUTHENTICATING RECORDS 
8.1.  Authentication Methods for Air Force Records. 
8.1.1.  Authentication. A record is authenticated when it contains an official signature 
indicating the document is genuine and official. A signature may be written, stamped, or 
electronic. Use one of the following methods to authenticate records issued in the conduct of 
Air Force business: 
8.1.1.1.  Written Signature. Sign the appropriate paper-based signature block using black 
or dark blue ink. Do not sign for another person; official directives or statutes require the 
personal signature of designated persons on many types of Air Force records. 
8.1.1.2.  Signature Facsimile. A signature facsimile is an authorized copy of an individual’s 
signature. Do not use signature facsimile to authenticate unless the records requiring 
signature are so numerous for that organization that the act of written authentication 
becomes a time-consuming task. 
8.1.1.2.1.  A signature facsimile on administrative records, such as form or transmittal 
memorandums, see Air Force Manual 33-326, Preparing Official Communications. 
8.1.1.2.2.  Physically safeguard signature facsimile equipment such as those used to 
authorize the expenditure of government funds or the binding of the Air Force or the 
government to a course of action. 
8.1.1.3.  Electronic Signing Technologies. Electronic signatures may be accomplished by 
several different technologies; personal identification numbers, digital signatures, smart 
cards and biometrics are all approved methods of electronic signing for authenticating e-
records. Information in an official Government e-mail header is a form of authentic 
electronic signature. Above any electronic signature block, enter “//SIGNED//” or a 
facsimile. This form of signing will be determined authentic for documenting e-mail and/or 
subject matter expert coordination when released from a Government e-mail account and 
when a legal requirement does not exist for either a physical or digital signature. (T-1). 
However, a digital signature may be required on a corresponding form intended to 
document the same intent. In that case, the user must contact the supporting legal office for 
signature requirements governed by federal statutes. (T-1). That office can also advise on 
a case-by-case basis which venue (physical, digital, electronic signature) would be most 
appropriate. The most important used methods are as follows: 
8.1.1.3.1.  Typed Notation. A method of signing an electronic document that serves to 
(a) identify and authenticate a particular person as the source of the electronic 
document; and (b) indicate such person’s approval of the information contained in the 
electronic document. The electronic signature may be embedded in the content of the 
record, or it may be stored separately. Formatting examples may be found in Air Force 
Handbook 33-337, Tongue and Quill. This form of signing will be determined authentic 
for documenting e-mail and/or subject matter expert coordination when released from 
a government e-mail account and when a legal requirement does not exist for either 
physical or digital signature. Typed notations may or may not be tightly linked to a 
64 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
form or document, whereas digital signatures are difficult or impossible to unlink from 
a document. 
8.1.1.3.2.  Digital Signatures. A method of authenticating records by producing a 
digital signature bound to both the record and the signer’s identity using cryptographic 
keys, operations, and protocols. Digital signatures serve to both verify a signer’s 
identity and provide integrity for the data contained in the record. 
8.1.1.3.2.1.  Information on digital signatures produced by a user’s computer using 
public key infrastructure can be located at http://www.archives.gov/records-
mgmt/policy/pki.html. 
8.1.1.3.2.2.  Forms managers must be consulted in advance to analyze any data 
collection tools that project officers have determined feasible and reliable for digital 
signature, vice physical signature. (T-1). Additional guidance can be found in AFI 
33-360. 
8.1.2.  Authentication of Electronically Signing Permanent Records. For permanent records, 
organizations must ensure that the printed name of the electronic signer, as well as the date 
when the signature was executed, be included as part of any human readable form (such as 
electronic display or printout) of the electronic record. (T-1). This is required so that the name 
of the signer will be preserved as part of the record.  
8.1.3.  Reproducing the Record That Has the Official Signature. Unless stated otherwise in the 
applicable statute or official directive, copies of a record bearing an official signature have the 
same authority as the original. 
8.2.  Authentication Authority. 
8.2.1.  Authority. An individual's right to authenticate records is granted by statute, directive, 
instruction, delegated authority, duty assignment, or specific position. Essentially, it is the 
capacity in which a person acts, not grade that determines the right to authenticate records. 
8.2.1.1.  Command Capacity. The responsibility of a commander or civilian director to 
authenticate Air Force records, and the extent to which they may designate others to 
authenticate records, follows the principles of command and staff and the principle of 
delegation of duties contained in Air Force Instruction 51-509, Appointment to and 
Assumption of Command. 
8.2.1.1.1.  A commander or civilian director continues to discharge command functions 
when temporarily absent from the place of duty (temporary duty, etc.). During 
absences, designated representatives continue to perform designated duties, see Air 
Force Instruction 51-509. 
8.2.1.2.  Non-command Capacity. When a statute or other directive does not require the 
commander's or director's personal signature, the deputy or vice commander is authorized

Disposition Schedule. 
Secret—Security classification applied to information; unauthorized disclosure of which 
reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original 
classification authority is able to identify or describe. 
Security Classification—A category to which national security information and material is 
assigned to denote the degree of damage that unauthorized disclosure would cause to national 
defense or foreign relations of the United States and to denote the degree of protection required. 
There are three such categories: top secret, secret, and confidential. 
Security Clearance—A administrative determination by competent authority that an individual is 
eligible for access to classified information.

community controls indicating restricted handling within present and future community 
intelligence collection programs and their end products for which community systems of 
compartmentation have been or will be formally established. 
Series—File units or documents arranged according to a filing system or kept together because 
they relate to a particular subject or function, result from the same activity, document a specific 
kind of transaction, take a particular physical form, or have some other relationship arising out of 
their creation, receipt, or use, such as restrictions on access and use; also called a record series or 
a file series. Generally handled as a unit for disposition purposes.

in performance of state-funded activities and belong to the state funding the activity. There may 
be a thin line separating federal and state records. For example, during a hurricane or flood a Guard 
unit may be activated to assist with a state emergency. Should the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency get involved or federal dollars be expended toward the emergency, the records created by 
the Guard become federal records. State records are the property of the state and federal records 
are the property of the agency (e.g., Air Force). When there is an issue of records being state or 
federal, the Air National Guard Unit base records manager should contact the Air National Guard 
command records manager for guidance. If necessary that person should coordinate with the Air 
Force Records Officer (and any other applicable command records manager.

Understanding or Memorandum of Agreement. 
System of Records—A group of records under the control of a Component from which an 
individual’s record is retrieved by the name or personal identifier.

RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO THE RECORDS DISPOSITION SCHEDULE 
A2.1.  Recommending Changes to the Records Disposition Schedule.  Records professionals 
and users at all levels may recommend changes to the Records Disposition Schedule to account 
for new, obsolete, or changed records used by Air Force organizations; to do so, they must first 
contact their command records manager or agency records manager.. (T-1). 
A2.2.  Air Force Form 525 is used to recommend or request changes, additions, or deletions 
to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.  Coordinate the Air Force Form 525 with 
appropriate personnel at each level before sending it to the next higher level. 
A2.3.  The command records manager coordinates with other major command or field 
operating agency/direct reporting unit records managers who have a prime or joint interest 
in the records before sending the suggestion to the Air Force Records Officer.  The command 
records manager coordinates with the command history office on changes relating to historical 
records and permanent records. The command records manager coordinates with the judge 
advocate’s office on suggestions relating to the legal rights of individuals or the Air Force. Show 
the coordination of the judge advocate on the AF Form 525. The command records manager 
indicates in item 17 if the records are privacy act records. Send approved recommendations to the 
Air Force Records Officer. For further information concerning command records managers (to 
include name, phone numbers, e-mail, mailing address, etc.), reference the Records Disposition 
Schedule. 
A2.4.  Justification of Changes. 
A2.4.1.  When a proposed new or revised record or a directive requires records not covered in 
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, the Office of Primary Responsibility sends Air 
Force Form 525 to the base records management office. The affected records are considered 
pending. The Office of Primary Responsibility may delay the draft of the directive while 
submitting Form 525, to include a qualifying statement such as: “Proposed disposition is 
tentative while needs of the users are determined.” In such instances, the base records manager 
or command records manager holds Form 525 for at least 6 months and then asks the Office 
of Primary Responsibility to confirm the proposed disposition. 
A2.4.2.  Completely justify all recommendations to keep records permanently or to increase 
an existing retention period. Justify the permanent retention of records in terms of their value 
for historical administration or for research, organizational changes, or protecting the legal 
rights of persons and the Government. In many instances, this type of justification requires a 
painstaking and searching analysis and evaluation and strong cooperation between records 
management personnel and subject matter specialists, legal advisors, and historians. Try to 
determine how many Air Force records are really essential; whether they effectively document 
Air Force activities and transactions; whether the Air Force can reduce retention periods; and 
how many so-called “permanent” records are of real enduring value. Since “enduring value” 
means keeping the records indefinitely (eventually offered for deposit to the National 
Archives), analysts accept that “permanent is forever.” No routine techniques can simplify the 
evaluation of permanent records. No substitute exists for a thorough and careful analysis by 
competent individuals. 
AFI33-322   23 MARCH 2020 
91 
A2.4.3.  Completely justify records that protect the legal and financial rights of personnel and 
the Air Force. Coordinate the items on legal rights with the judge advocate’s office. Send the 
judge advocate’s comments along with the Air Force Form 525. National Archives and 
Records Administration and the Air Force Records Officer use these comments to make an 
informed decision on the retention value of the records. 
A2.4.4.  Dispositions Pending. The Air Force Records Officer is required notify all command 
records managers when an Air Force Form 525 has been submitted, informing them that the 
disposition is pending until further notice, and the Air Force Records Information Management 
System will be annotated with disposition pending. The unscheduled status may mean a 
proposed disposition schedule has not been developed, the proposed schedule has been 
submitted to the Air Force Records Officer but not to the National Archives, the proposed 
schedule has been submitted to the National Archives but it is in “Disposition Pending” status, 
or the National Archives has not completed the appraisal. 
A2.4.5.  Dispositions Approved. Amend or re-accomplish inventory of records and file 
disposition control labels to reflect new disposition standards or add additional record series. 
Review inactive files to ensure dispositions are updated according to new or revised standards. 
Amend the Standard Form 135 for staging area records to reflect changes.
