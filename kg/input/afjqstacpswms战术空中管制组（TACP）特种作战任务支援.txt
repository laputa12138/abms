1. Purpose. This Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) provides a framework for
TACP Special Warfare Mission Support (SWMS) Airmen to document unique Cross Utilization
Training within Special Warfare units. SWMS Airmen, regardless of Air Force Specialty Code
(AFSC), are asked to perform duties and tasks outside of their respective Career Field Education
& Training Plans and this document serves to bridge the gap and aid supervisors with
establishing a standardized baseline across SWMS AFSCs. This document applies to the Total
Force but may be supplemented to capture unique requirements not common across the Total
Force, such as unique MAJCOM/Wing/Group/Squadron specific processes. This is a stand-alone
product and does not require an accompanying Master Training Plan and/or Individual Training
Plan. This AFJQS applies to all AFSCs listed above unless otherwise stated under paragraph 5,
Exceptions.
2. Task Qualification. Personnel will be qualified to the Go/No Go standard for all tasks listed
in this AFJQS. Go means the individual can perform/identify the task, without assistance,
utilizing appropriate instructions, training references, or other procedural guidance.
3. Additional Duty or Task. If personnel are assigned an additional duty or task not listed in this
AFJQS, the supervisor will develop a DAF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/
Command JQS. The supervisor/trainer will then develop a plan for the member to receive
training and become duty position qualified.
4. Training Documentation and Trainer/Certifier Identification. Document training required
by this AFJQS in accordance with DAFMAN 36-2689, Training Program.
5. Exceptions. 2G0X1 will only conduct tasks 7 and 8 within this AFJQS.
6. This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable Career Field Managers. Overall point of
contact for this AFJQS is HAF/A3S, DSN 222-3224, af.a3s.workflow@us.af.mil.
