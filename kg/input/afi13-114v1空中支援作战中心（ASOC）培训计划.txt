AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
Chapter 2 
TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION STANDARDS 
2.1.  Unit Operating Instruction (OI).  The unit OI outlines how units will implement the 
requirements of this instruction.  Post the unit OI with this instruction and any other applicable 
supplements (hardcopy or digital).  The unit commander will approve the operating instruction.  
The OI will, as a minimum, address the following items to support the unit’s training program 
(from initial qualification training [IQT] through MQT to CMR status, the CT process, and 
Upgrade training): 
2.1.1.  Purpose, applicability, and training manning. 
2.1.2.  Unit training manager’s responsibilities. 
2.1.3.  Training documentation procedures. 
2.1.4.  Additional MQT, CT and Upgrade requirements unique to each unit, as appropriate. 
2.1.5.  Squadrons will forward OIs to the group UTM for review (T-3).  Group UTMs will 
assist subordinate units to address all required areas (T-3). 
2.2.  Unit Training Process. 
2.2.1.  The ASOC Initial Qualification Course (IQC) satisfies the minimum IQT 
requirements for ASOC Operations personnel, and fills the initial TACTICS requirements for 
the topics covered.  Attendance at ASOC IQC is not required for ASOC support personnel.  
See Chapter 3 for additional IQT requirements. 
2.2.2.  MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify a member in specific duty 
position(s) required to perform missions assigned to a specific unit.  Completion of MQT is a 
prerequisite for CMR status. 
2.2.3.  Commanders certify, in writing, an individual as CMR after completion of IQT (if 
required) and MQT (Chapter 5). 
2.2.4.  CT is unit specific training or higher headquarters identified training to maintain or 
increase CMR proficiency. 
2.2.5.  Training tasks identified with a subject knowledge level code will have a written test 
developed that objectively evaluates required knowledge levels for all training tasks. 
2.2.6.  Training tasks identified with a task performance level code will have a task 
evaluation with a grade of 2 or better to meet ASOC Training Task List (TTL) standards. 
2.3.  Training Program and Schedule Adjustments. 
2.3.1.  Commanders may adjust the training time or remove personnel from training due to 
medical disqualification, emergency leave, deployments, or administrative action.  The 
supervisor or UTM will document adjustments in the individual’s ASOC Training Folder 
and/or in TACTICS (T-3). 
2.3.2.  The commander may adjust the training dates for completion of requirements based 
on an individual’s TDY or emergency leave of 30 cumulative days [three (3) unit training 
assemblies (UTAs) for ANG] or more.  Personnel who are TDY for 30 consecutive days or 3 
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
  11  
UTAs or more will continue to accomplish training at temporary locations where MQT or CT 
training is available (T-3). 
2.3.3.  Training extensions will be granted based on any circumstances other than TDY or 
emergency leave that a commander determines requires a training extension.  As 
circumstances dictate, unit commanders may grant an individual one training extension in 
each phase of training.  Group commanders can grant a second extension.  If necessary, 
MAJCOM OPRs may grant a third extension.  One training extension equals 30 calendar 
days, or 3 UTAs for ANG units.  If training is still not complete, the MAJCOM OPR will 
determine whether or not the individual is to be removed from training. 
2.3.4.  Previously certified CMR ASOC personnel. ASOC personnel that were previously 
certified CMR at an ASOC, and received the special experience identifier (SEI) 045, are not 
required to attend ASOC IQC. It is recommended that they attend ASOC IQC, but that is at 
the discretion of the unit commander. Once at the unit, they will complete MQT. This 
training will be specifically designed and will be based on the individual’s experience and 
requirements to get the individual to CMR status. 
2.4.  ASOC Training Folder. 
2.4.1.  The ASOC Training Folder is a six-part folder for all ASOC documentation and is 
required for all ASOC personnel.  The format for naming all documents is as follows: Last 
Name, First Initial, Date [2-number day, 3-letter month, 2-number year without spaces, i.e., 
01Nov13], Document Title.  Documents will be filed most recent to least recent (T-3). 
2.4.1.1.  Part I is the “Table of Contents.”  File signed AF Form 623b in this section (T-. 
2.4.1.2.  Part II is “Commanders Designation Letters.”  Commander signed AF Form 
623a for CMR status with the most recent on top. 
2.4.1.3.  Part III is “Event Logs.” 
2.4.1.4.  Part IV is “Documentation of Training.”  File AF Form 1098, AF Form 623A 
and ASOC training grade sheets in this section. 
2.4.1.5.  Part V is for “Formal School Diplomas.” This portion will have the certificate of 
training from ASOC Initial Qualification Course (PDS:-XEQ), and the JT-101/JT-102 
certificates (as required).  Include the ASOC IQC student training report until the person 
achieves CMR. 
2.4.1.6.  Part VI is for “Miscellaneous” documents.  File the AF Form 2096 awarding the 
appropriate Special Experience Identifier in this section. 
2.5.  ASOC Augmentee Training Requirements. 
2.5.1.  Individuals scheduled to augment ASOC operations must attend the ACC ASOC 
Initial Qualification Course and complete unit MQT items (as determined by the gaining 
ASOC commander and gaining ASOC unit training manager) prior to deploying to fill an 
ASOC duty position (T-3). 
2.5.2.  Individuals scheduled to augment ASOC support personnel must complete unit 
required MQT items (as determined by the gaining ASOC commander and gaining ASOC 
unit training manager) prior to deploying to fill an ASOC support position (T-3).

AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
2.5.3.  For operations personnel, an augmentee is defined as any individual that is not a 
qualified ASOC operations crewmember, but is scheduled to fill an ASOC operations crew 
duty position.  See Attachment 1 for definition of operations personnel. 
2.6.  Operations Crew Training.  This training is focused on executing the fundamental ASOC 
air-to-ground, command and control mission.  The objective of all crew training is to improve 
decision making, situational awareness, resource management, collaborative support/integration 
and other similar factors.  To meet this objective, units should use a building block approach 
consisting of PTTs and FMTs.  See Attachment 1 for the definition of PTT and FMT. 
2.6.1.  Because peacetime training rarely has all agencies and entities that the ASOC 
interfaces with available for participation, effective ASOC training depends upon 
supplemental support (white cell) to simulate these agencies and entities from the Theater 
Air-Ground System (TAGS) that the ASOC typically coordinates with during mission 
execution.  See Attachment 1 for the definition of white cell. 
2.6.1.1.  Units must provide the white cell with scenario basics, training requirements, 
event type, sequencing and intensity to define the parameters for scenario development 
(T-3).  The Weapons and Training section or designated white cell player, must act as an 
interface with other entities to modulate and focus white cell injects and responses to 
meet unit training objectives (T-3). 
2.6.2.  To the maximum extent, use actual computer and communications systems to provide 
ASOC connectivity to external agencies within the theater air control system (TACS).  
Examples of these systems include, but not limited to, internet relay chat (IRC) programs, 
Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) 
Close Air Support System (TACP CASS), common operating picture, simulated radios, and 
aircraft through radios and/or digital gateways. 
2.7.  Support Personnel Training.  Support personnel will accomplish specific training items 
listed in Table 4.1 to complete ASOC mission qualification training (T-3).  They will become 
ASOC CMR IAW Chapter 5.  Continuation training requirements for support personnel are 
listed in Table 6.1.

Chapter 4 
MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 
4.1.  General.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT) provides unit-level training required for 
CMR certification.  MQT starts after IQT is completed for previously unqualified ASOC 
personnel (non-SEI 045), and upon arrival for previously qualified, non-CMR (have SEI 045) 
ASOC personnel.  Individuals awaiting formal training may enter MQT early, but must complete 
IQT before receiving CMR certification (T-1).  There is not a required sequence for completing 
this training unless otherwise specified.  All FMT events (including certification) will be graded 
by a CMR-qualified individual, and will use the gradesheets in Attachment 5 (T-3).  Failure to 
complete a PTT/FMT event satisfactory will result in repeating that event until demonstrated 
performance meets the required level (T-3).  Complete all MQT requirements within 180 days of 
entry or 12 UTAs for ANG (T-3). 
4.1.1.  Operations personnel who complete IQT will be entered (re-entered for those 
individuals that started MQT prior to IQT) into MQT on the next duty day after arriving at 
home station (ANG following month) (T-3). 
4.1.2.  Support personnel will be entered into ASOC MQT within 5 days (ANG 1 month) of 
signing into the unit (T-3). 
4.1.3.  MQT time extensions may be granted IAW paragraph 2.3. 
4.2.  MQT Definitions.  All UTC tasked personnel, regardless of rank or AFSC, will comply 
with the training requirements listed in this chapter (T-3). 
4.2.1.  Operations Personnel.  Operations personnel are those individuals filling ASOC crew 
positions with the AFSCs listed in para 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2.  The crew duty positions are the

online at: http://jko.jten.mil/ prior to being certified (T-3). 
4.8.  MQT Operations Crew Duty Position Training (FMT). 
4.8.1.  Conduct at least two Full Mission Training (FMT) events per designated duty position 
(T-3).   The unit commander may waive FMT-1 based on the individual’s experience and 
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
  19  
requirements.  The unit commander will determine the duty positions in which an individual 
will receive training during MQT based upon current unit manning requirements, individual 
capabilities/AFSC, and guidance within this instruction.  Conduct FMTs using IW or 
Conventional Warfare (CW) scenarios (T-3).  The FMT scenarios will be designed and 
executed according to the unit OI and unit commander’s discretion. 
4.8.2.  FMT events must be accomplished in sequential order within each duty position (IW 
or CW) (T-3).  Training may overlap between different duty positions.  For example, an 
officer may complete FMT-1 for ASM and then FMT-1 for ATOM, and complete FMT-2 for 
ATOM followed by FMT-2 for ASM. 
4.8.2.1.  FMT-1, Coaching: MQT personnel perform ASOC crew duties with 
some/minimal assistance (“over the shoulder” from an individual that is CMR-qualified 
in the same duty position).  This training will include duty position preparation, execution 
and changeover brief.  The FMT-1 scenario should be less complex than FMT-2. 
4.8.2.2.  FMT-2, Monitoring: MQT personnel perform ASOC crew duties without any 
assistance (an individual that is CMR-qualified in the same duty position CMR-qualified 
individual will observe).  This training will include duty position preparation, execution 
and changeover brief. 
4.8.2.3.  FMT-Assessment: Accomplish FMT assessment IAW paragraph 4.9.2 upon 
completion of all FMT events. 
4.9.  MQT Certification.  Upon completion of all FMT events and other MQT requirements, 
units will conduct an Academic and Operational Mission Qualification Assessments to validate 
the individual’s capability to fully perform appropriate functions in the ASOC.  For operations 
personnel, this will include any and all of the previously trained ASOC ops crew duty positions 
in both IW and Conventional Warfare scenarios (T-3). 
4.9.1.  Academic Assessment.  OTM/DOT will administer an ASOC MQF examination to 
complete this assessment.  Maintain the completed MQF exam score and date in the 
individual’s ASOC Training Folder.  N/A for support personnel (T-3). 
4.9.2.  Operational Assessment.  Conduct at least one FMT in performing this assessment.  
Only one FMT event is required to complete this training, but must sufficiently address all 
areas of knowledge and performance either through observation or discussion.  An individual 
that is CMR-qualified in the respective duty position will accomplish this certification (T-3). 
4.9.3.  MQT personnel are certified CMR upon completion of the assessments, and must be 
approved by the squadron commander (T-3).   Commanders will document CMR status in an 
AF Form 623a, and comply with requirements outlined in Chapters 5 and 6.  The squadron 
commander or OTM/UTM will maintain a document (Letter of Qualifications) that identifies 
an individual’s particular operations crew duty qualifications (see Attachment 4) (T-3). 
4.10.  ASOC Master Question File (MQF).  The ASOC MQF is a set of applicable questions 
designed to assess knowledge about an ASOC.  ACC/A3F is responsible for ensuring that an 
applicable MQF questions database is produced to support this AFI. 
4.10.1.  Updates to the MQF.  ACC/A3F will conduct an annual review of the MQF, with 
assistance from the NAFs, and from other MAJCOMs and ANG, and their respective units. 
  20  
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
4.10.1.1.  The review will focus on correcting erroneous questions, deleting outdated or 
invalid questions, and/or adding new questions to the database as a result of reference 
document changes. 
4.10.1.2.  MAJCOMs will forward their suggested changes to HQ ACC/A3F.  HQ 
ACC/A3F will adjudicate all MAJCOM inputs, and publish an updated MQF within 30 
days of the end of the review process. 
4.10.2.  The unit OTM/UTM is responsible for creating 50 question unit ASOC MQF 
examination(s) from the ACC/A3J developed MQF  (T-3). 
4.10.2.1.  Security.  Only the OTM/UTM or individuals designated by the commander 
will administer examinations.  They will maintain strict control of all examinations and 
answer keys by securing them in a locked container or password-protected computer 
program.

individual’s ASOC Training Folder/AF 623 (TBA or AFTR) (T-3). 
5.4.  Regaining Combat Mission Ready Status. 
5.4.1.  N-CMR individuals must successfully accomplish the task(s) in which they are 
deficient in order to regain CMR status.  OTM/DOT will work with the individual’s 
supervisor to develop a training plan to address the individual’s deficiencies (T-3). 
5.4.2.  If the N-CMR individual’s training plan requires being re-entered into MQT, comply 
with Chapter 4 (T-3). 
5.4.3.  Once all prescribed requirements have been completed, commanders will recertify an 
individual’s CMR status on AF Form 623a, and the form will be filed in the individual’s 
ASOC Training Folder (T-3). 
5.5.  Failure to Complete Training Items (Task Deficiency). 
5.5.1.  OTM/DOT, through the individual’s supervisor, will notify the unit commander of an 
individual’s task(s) deficiency.  Commanders and supervisors may annotate an individual’s 
deficiencies, without loss of CMR status (unless otherwise determined IAW paragraph 
5.3.1.3), in the specific areas below: 
5.5.1.1.  Lack of academic/task training from Table 6.1. 
5.5.1.2.  Lack of FMT event completion due to external factors from Table 6.2.

Chapter 6 
CONTINUATION TRAINING 
6.1.  General.  This chapter prescribes training standards to maintain CMR personnel qualified 
on mission knowledge, skills, and tasks.  All personnel must accomplish continuation training 
(CT) events once per training period, unless otherwise specified (T-3). 
6.1.1.  Recurring Training Period.  CT requirements will use a sliding calendar for annual 
and biennial training events.  This period begins at the end of month in which the training 
task was last accomplished.  The ANG Recurring Training Period is 24 UTAs. 
6.1.1.1.  Training period example.  An individual who accomplishes a biennial training 
item on 10 September 2011 must re-accomplish that event by midnight, 30 September 
2013. 
6.2.  Training Events.  CT requirements will follow the basic ASOC training aspects outlined in 
Chapter 2.  Academic-related training in all ASOC training aspects will be a combination of unit 
generated events and computer-based training (i.e., TACTICS).  All academic-related training 
will require successful completion of an examination (80 percent minimum to pass) (T-3). 
6.2.1.  TACTICS will be used for ASOC CT requirements to the maximum extent possible 
(see Chapter 8).  For those training areas not presently in TACTICS, unit or higher-
headquarters developed training plans will be used until those areas are contained in 
TACTICS.  Units should notify ACC/A3FC of these deficiencies in TACTICS. 
6.2.2.  Units may use a combination of TACTICS and locally developed training (approved 
by the unit commander) to complete CT requirements.  Locally developed training must 
include an examination identified in paragraph 6.3, and will be documented in TACTICS. 
6.3.  Continuation Training.  Table 6.1 identifies the ASOC continuation training requirements 
for both operations and support personnel.  See Attachment 1, Terms, for definitions of 
operations personnel (OPS) and support personnel (SPT). 
6.3.1.  The academic and task training prepares individuals to complete the Recurring 
Assessment Events (see paragraph 6.5).

NOTES: 
1.  See paragraph 5.7 for currency requirements. 
2.  Can be accomplished in any qualified ASOC operations crew duty position. 
3.  Procedural control training will be emphasized during FMT events. 
6.4.1.  ASOC ops personnel that are qualified in multiple duty positions must accomplish at 
least two FMTs every 180 days for each duty position qualification (T-3).  For example, an 
officer who is a qualified ASM, ATOM and SAD must do two FMT as the ASM, two as the 
ATOM, and two as the SAD.  ANG must accomplish one FMT every 180 days (T-3). 
6.4.2.  FMT events completed during MQT do not count toward maintaining CMR currency.  
The recurring training period begins from the initial CMR date. 
6.5.  Recurring Assessment Events.  In order to ensure proficiency, accountability, and mission 
readiness, personnel will receive a recurring assessment for each ASOC duty position in which 
they are qualified.  Failure to successfully complete a recurring assessment will result in an 
individual being placed on N-CMR status in that duty position (see paragraph 5.3) (T-3). 
6.5.1.  There will be a maximum of 17 months between assessments (T-3).  For example, an 
individual who accomplishes an Academic assessment on 10 August 2014 must re-
accomplish that Academic assessment by midnight, 31 January 2016. 
6.5.1.1.  Academic assessment.  Operations personnel will complete a test from the 
ASOC Master Question File (MQF) on an annual basis (T-3). 
6.5.1.2.  Operational assessment.  Operations personnel will complete a crew duty 
assessment on a recurring basis.  This will be conducted via an FMT event with a CMR-
qualified individual observing performance.  This assessment must analyze, by 
observation or discussion, an individual’s performance and knowledge in all qualified 
duty positions (T-3). 
6.5.2.  Deleted. 
6.5.3.  Deleted. 
6.5.4.  The Academic assessment is a separate event, and not directly tied to the Operational 
assessment.  For example, an individual who is dual qualified as an ATOM and ASM must 
accomplish one Academic assessment, one ATOM FMT assessment, and one ASM FMT 
assessment within 17 months. 
6.5.4.1.  Deleted. 
6.5.4.2.  Operational assessments may be combined into one event if: 1) the individual 
doing the assessments is qualified in the same duty positions as the individual taking the 
assessments; and 2) there is enough time and the mission scenario allows for the 
accomplishment of all required tasks for each duty position being assessed. 
  28  
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
6.5.5.  Informal assessments and feedback should be conducted during all FMT events. 
Supervisors should recommend additional training and/or N-CMR status for individuals who 
do not demonstrate a satisfactory level of performance and/or operational knowledge. 
6.5.6.  Record the score and date of the most recent MQF examination on an AF Form 623a

ASOC DUTY POSITION UPGRADE TRAINING 
7.1.  General.  This chapter provides guidance for the prerequisites, training requirements and 
certification for the operations crew duty positions and functions of Procedural Controller (PC) 
and Senior Air Director/Technician (SAD/T).  There is not a specific sequence for completing 
this training.  An individual that is CMR-qualified in the upgrade position will grade all upgrade 
FMT events (including assessments), and will use the grade sheets in Attachment 5.  Squadron 
leadership will nominate individuals to complete upgrade training.  The training outlined in this 
chapter is the minimum acceptable; units are encouraged to conduct additional training as 
outlined in their unit OIs when upgrading personnel.  This chapter applies only to operations 
crew duty positions. 
7.2.  Procedural Controller (PC) Upgrade Training. 
7.2.1.  PC Prerequisites.  Personnel currently qualified in a duty position must complete a 
unit developed training program to become a PC (T-3).  The only AFSCs authorized enter PC 
MQT and perform PC duties are 1C5X1D, 1C4X1 (JTAC) with SEI 914, 279, 280, 13LXA 
(JTAC) with SEI 09C, 09D, or 09E, and 13BXU only).  1C5X1D will accomplish PC 
qualification during MQT. 
7.2.2.  PC Academic Training. Personnel will receive and document the following training 
(T-3): 
7.2.2.1.  Aircraft operating characteristics, capabilities and limitations. 
7.2.2.2.  Threats to air operations. 
7.2.2.3.  Combat airspace fundamentals; review/understand Airspace Control Plan (ACP), 
Air Control Order (ACO), Airspace Coordinating Measures (ACM) and Special 
Instructions (SPINS). 
7.2.2.4.  Impacts on combat operations (e.g. weather, geography, etc.). 
7.2.2.5.  Review applicable portions of AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and 
Procedures, and local/ applicable range regulations. 
7.2.2.6.  Operational brevity words, definitions, and communications standards. 
7.2.2.7.  Review AFTTP 3-3.JSTARS, chapter 12, Procedural Control.  (Note: This 
prerequisite will be replaced with Tactics Bulletin, ASOC Operations, when published) 
7.2.3.  PC Operations Crew Duty Position Training (FMT). Training will focus on mission 
planning, ACM processes, joint airspace integration, and will grade the PC candidate’s 
ability to (T-3): 
7.2.3.1.  Comply with ACP, SPINS and Rules of Engagement (ROE). 
7.2.3.2.  Plan and execute effective CAS stacks integrating joint fires, weather, threat 
activity and aircraft performance. 
7.2.3.3.  Maintain situational awareness on airspace users. 
7.2.3.4.  Coordinate with C2 agencies (e.g. CRC, AWACS, JSTARS, AOC, etc.). 
  30  
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
7.2.3.5.  PC training scenarios (to be accomplished in order): 
7.2.3.5.1.  PTT-1. A current PC-qualified individual demonstrates and then allows the 
PC candidate to conduct basic procedural control techniques and practices. 
7.2.3.5.2.  PTT-2. Consists of limited aircraft; employs preplanned ACMs and 
preplanned indirect and joint fires. 
7.2.3.5.3.  FMT-1. Consists of multiple types of aircraft (rotary and fixed-wing); 
employs simplistic enemy threats, preplanned and dynamic ACMs, and indirect and 
joint fires. 
7.2.4.  PC Assessment. Units will conduct an initial assessment of PC candidates to validate 
their aptitude and competency to control airborne assets.  This assessment will be 
accomplished by a CMR PC-qualified individual (T-3). 
7.2.4.1.  Academic assessment. Explain procedural control, airspace factors, and combat 
operations to the level of satisfaction as determined by the certifying PC-qualified 
individual. 
7.2.4.2.  Operational Assessment (PC FMT). Conduct an FMT PC assessment event.  
This assessment should consist of numerous types of aircraft, significant enemy activity, 
and highly dynamic ACMs and indirect and joint fires. 
7.2.5.  The unit commander will certify each PC in writing on AF Form 623a following 
satisfactory completion of all PC assessments.  This AF Form 623a will be placed into the 
individual’s ASOC training folder in TACTICS (T-3). 
7.3.  Senior Air Director / Senior Air Technician (SAD/T) Upgrade Training.  Squadron 
leadership should only nominate, and unit commanders should only approve, the most qualified 
individuals for SAD/T training.  A highly qualified individual is experienced in multiple ASOC 
duty positions.  This upgrade is the most comprehensive process within ASOC duty position 
qualification training, and requires significant resources to complete. 
7.3.1.  SAD/T Prerequisites.  Personnel upgrading to SAD/T must have a minimum of one 
year of CMR experience (T-3).  Individuals upgrading to SAT must be an NCO in CAFSC 
1C471 or 1C571D (T-3). 
7.3.1.1.  Squadron commander may waive up to six months of CMR experience. 
7.3.2.  SAD/T Academic and Exercise Training. Units will tailor this training plan for each 
individual candidate for squadron commander approval.  It must be designed for task-based 
experience, as well as classroom training.  Training will include the following areas (T-3): 
7.3.2.1.  Joint Fires capabilities and integration. 
7.3.2.2.  Army CAS planning and TACP operations (e.g. accomplished through 
participation/ observation during a major division/corps level exercise, such as GREEN 
FLAG, UNIFIED ENDEAVOR, division/corps mission readiness exercise [MRX], etc.). 
7.3.2.3.  Digitally-aided CAS and Gateway operations, processes and employment. The 
candidate must complete JT-100 (T-3). 
7.3.2.4.  AOC operations, processes and employment (e.g. accomplished by attending the 
Joint Air Operations Planning Course [JAOPC], Maxwell AFB AL). 
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
  31  
7.3.3.  SAD/T Operations Crew Duty Position Training (FMT). SAD/T upgrade training will 
place specific emphasis on efficient ASOC crew operations and mission integration (refer to 
AFI 13-114, Volume 3, paragraph 2.5) (T-3). 
7.3.3.1.  FMT-1, Crew Operations. Focus on internal ASOC crew responsibilities, 
processes, and coordination. 
7.3.3.2.  FMT-2, TAGS.  Focus on external integration with element of both the 
TACS/AAGS. 
7.3.4.  SAD/T Assessment. Units will have a CMR-qualified SAD/T conduct an assessment 
of SAD/T candidates to validate their capability to function as a SAD/T. 
7.3.4.1.  Academic assessment. Explain ASOC operations processes, functions, and 
squadron’s assigned mission to a CMR qualified SAD/T’s level of satisfaction. 
7.3.4.2.  Operational Assessment. A CMR-qualified SAD/T will conduct an FMT 
assessment trainer to determine the SAD/T candidate’s ability to effectively 
manage/supervise the entire ASOC operations crew, and to properly integrate with other 
elements of the TAGS. 
7.3.4.3.  Following the successful completion of the SAD/T candidate’s assessment, the 
unit commander must approve the SAD/T candidate.  The unit commander or 
OTM/UTM will maintain a document (Letter of X’s) that identifies an individual’s 
positional qualifications, and will maintain documentation in the individual training 
folder. 
7.3.5.  SAD/T Currency and Recurring Assessment. 
7.3.5.1.  SAD/Ts must accomplish two FMT in the SAD/T duty position every 180 days 
(ANG must complete one FMT every 180 days) (T-3).  The recurring assessment event 
does NOT count towards this requirement.  If a SAD/T does not meet this requirement, 
they must retrain IAW a unit commander approved retraining program, and documented 
in the individual’s training record (T-3). 
7.3.5.2.  All CMR SAD/Ts will accomplish a recurring assessment IAW paragraph 6.5.2, 
specific to SAD/T duties (T-3).

THEATER AIR CONTROL TRAINING INFORMATION COMPUTER SYSTEM 
8.1.  General. 
8.1.1.  TACTICS provides the user with access to online courseware, and the ability to record 
courses and tests taken offline from the training tables.  Users also have access to the Power 
Point® presentations associated with each course, including full course notes as well as all 
non-restricted references and a glossary of terms. 
8.1.2.  Access into TACTICS is divided into three separate areas:  Super User, Level II and 
Student.  Super User access is reserved for administrative use only.  Level II access is an 
administrative level for users that allows them to enter assigned personnel into the TACTICS 
system and to track unit/individual progress.  Level II use is regulated by ACC/A3FC, with 
inputs from the other MAJCOMs, and will be granted only to accommodate the level of view 
necessary to perform assigned duties.  Typically, the Level II users are the Unit Training 
Managers, but can include higher ranking officers with a need-to-know.  Student is the 
standard user level that allows a member to take tests and view their individual progress only. 
8.2.  Training in TACTICS.  Training in TACTICS is accomplished through units known as 
Modules.  Each module is followed by a mandatory test and a criterion checklist, when 
applicable.  Test formats are either true-or-false, or multiple choice, and test questions are 
randomly generated each time.  TACTICS tests are designed to be taken in an open book format.  
Visual cues give the learner immediate indication of which modules they have not attempted, 
attempted and failed, or completed successfully. 
8.2.1.  All user scores are stored and maintained, as well as the individual answers to each 
question, so a user may go back and review those questions they missed.  If the user is 
unsuccessful in accomplishing a test, they are not allowed to view their responses and must 
review the training material.  However, if the person passes the test but has missed one or 
two questions, they will be allowed to review the correct responses and the associated 
references.  Supervisors are notified via e-mail of a subordinate’s progress (pass/fail) through 
the training modules. 
8.3.  Responsibilities for TACTICS.  The responsibilities for use of TACTICS are as follows: 
8.3.1.  ACC/A3FC will: 
8.3.1.1.  Be responsible for overall control and management of the TACTICS system. 
8.3.1.2.  Grant, upon request, Level II access for TACTICS on a need-to-have basis. 
8.3.1.3.  Provide direction and prioritization of module production. 
8.3.2.  Commanders will (T-3): 
8.3.2.1.  Ensure that TACTICS is instituted and operated at unit level. 
8.3.2.2.  Utilize TACTICS to track individual/unit training status. 
8.3.3.  Level II/Administrators will (T-3): 
8.3.3.1.  Ensure that personnel are knowledgeable of TACTICS. 
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
  33  
8.3.3.2.  Ensure that incoming personnel are registered in the TACTICS system and that 
their personnel information is correct. 
8.3.3.3.  Upon permanent change of station (PCS), transfer personnel registered in the 
TACTICS departing the unit to their gaining unit. 
8.3.3.4.  Track individual/unit training progress and report to the commander any 
negative trends. 
8.3.3.5.  Use their chain of command to request any upgrades to Level II access. 
8.3.3.6.  If 
problems 
occur, 
contact 
technical 
support 
at 
techsupport@odysseyconsult.com. 
8.3.4.  Standard Users/Students will (T-3): 
8.3.4.1.  Upon PCS, contact the gaining Unit Training Manager to ensure that their 
registration in TACTICS was transferred. 
8.3.4.2.  Maintain current e-mail addresses for themselves and their supervisor in the 
TACTICS system (This is a priority). 
8.3.4.3.  Maintain current Student Profile information. 
8.3.4.4.  Read the system messages each time they login to stay aware of course additions 
and updates. 
8.3.4.5.  Contact technical support at techsupport@odysseyconsult.com if problems 
operating TACTICS occur. 
8.4.  TACTICS Level II Access. 
8.4.1.  Each Squadron and Group should have a limited number of personnel with Level II 
access capability in order to load newly assigned personnel, and to monitor all training 
progression in the unit.  Level II access is usually reserved for the unit commander, director 
of operations, operations superintendent, training NCOIC, and any other person identified by 
the commander. 
8.4.2.  Each squadron will forward the names of the personnel requiring Level II access to 
their appropriate Group (for those squadrons without a Group, forward names to appropriate 
MAJCOM) (T-3).  The Groups will forward the names to the appropriate MAJCOM.  
USAFE and PACAF will submit names to ACC/A3J, who will process all Level II access 
requests (T-3).

Terms 
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status awarded to an individual who completes IQT and 
MQT, and is certified by the commander (Chapter 5). 
Continuation Training (CT)—Training required to maintain duty position qualification. 
Full Mission Trainer (FMT)—An FMT event requires crew and system integration for 
operations personnel to perform part or all of the ASOC mission/functions.  Crew size is scalable 
for an FMT event, but having the majority of the duty position functions performing will make 
for a more effective training session.  The FMT may be accomplished via live events (e.g. large 
scale exercises or local CAS training) used in conjunction with simulation (virtual or 
constructive) methods that emulate functions and players not within the exercise.  Fully 
simulated events are most appropriate when ASOC training objectives have priority over all 
other players. 
ASOC FMT Scenarios.  ASOC FMT scenarios fall within two broad categories: Irregular 
Warfare (IW) and Conventional Warfare (CW). 
Irregular Warfare (IW).  IW is a type of warfare that is not associated with a traditional 
linear battlefield, and is representative of contemporary real—world operations.  Other 
terms associated with IW include “non-linear warfare; stability, security, transition and 
reconstruction operations (SSTR); and counter-insurgency (COIN) operations.”  In many cases, 
kinetic operations are less intense than information, mobility, and intelligence operations. 
Conventional Warfare (CW).  Conventional Warfare is a type of warfare that is linear in 
nature with well—defined battle areas and boundaries between the opposing forces.  Other 
AFI13-114V1  30 April 2013 
  43  
terms associated with Conventional Warfare include “full-scale operations.”  In many cases, 
kinetic operations are the driving requirement. 
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—A formal training process designed to initially qualify an 
individual to perform their duty position requirements without regard to unit’s operational 
mission. 
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of 
competence in a unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR status. 
Non—Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)—The status CMR individuals are placed in after 
failing to complete academic/proficiency training or currency requirements within the allotted 
training cycle. 
Operations Personnel—Individuals assigned to an ASOC duty position with the following 
AFSCs; 1XXXU, 13XXX, 14N, 1C4X1, 1C5X1, 1C5X1D, and 1N0XX. 
Operations Officer.  The Operations Officer is from AFSC 13L, 11X, 12X or 13B, or a 
Senior Non—Commissioned Officer (NCO) 1C471/1C491.  The ASOC Operations Officer 
performs the crew duties of Senior Air Director (SAD), Air Tasking Order [ATO] Manager 
(ATOM), and/or Air Space Manager (ASM). A Senior NCO can fill ATOM or ASM duty 
positions, except the Senior Air Director. 
Officers may perform technician duties (except Senior Air Technician [SAT]), if required and 
certified. 
Senior Enlisted operations personnel may perform all technical duties, if required and certified. 
Operations Enlisted.  Enlisted ASOC operations personnel consist of Tactical Air Control 
Party (1C4) specialist, Command and Control Battle Management Operator (1C5) or 
Weapons Director (1C5X1D).  These personnel perform the ASOC crew duties of JARN 
Operator, Interface Control Technician (ICT), and/or Procedural Controller (PC).  The 
Senior Air Technician (SAT) position (formerly the Crew Superintendent) will be filled by 
a Senior NCO 1C4 AFSC (MAJCOM waiverable to E—6). 
Intelligence Duty Officer/Intelligence Duty Technician (IDO/T).  The IDO and IDT are 
Intelligence personnel (14N and 1N0X1) fulfilling specific functions, and will complete MQT 
certification. 
Part Task Trainer (PTT)—A PTT event is any event where an individual performs a limited 
aspect of the ASOC mission/functions.  The training focuses on an individual performing limited 
or specific operations crew duty functions.  Systems training, initial position set-up and position 
mission planning are examples of appropriate PTT events.  The PTT may be accomplished via 
live events (e.g. large scale exercises or local close air support [CAS] training), but is best 
designed for small-scale, simulation (virtual or constructive) events. 
Support Personnel—Individuals (other than Operations personnel) assigned to an ASOC UTC 
duty position.  Support personnel consist of members performing the following functions: 
Cyberspace Control Officer (17D3B)/Superintendent (3D190).  Manages system analysis and 
design, programming, systems operation and maintenance, resource management and security 
management.  Directs activities for installing, maintaining, repairing, overhauling, deploying,

computer systems and plans for responding to service outages and interruptions to network 
operations. Administers server—based networked systems, distributed applications, network 
storage, messaging, and application monitoring required to provision, sustain, operate and 
integrate cyber networked systems and applications in garrison and at deployed locations.  Core 
competencies include: server operating systems, database administration, web technologies, 
systems-related project management and supervising computer operators as well as consultant 
for computer-based problems beyond the knowledge of Client Systems technicians.  Supports 
identification, reconnaissance and exploitation of vulnerabilities while enhancing capabilities 
within cyber environments to achieve desired affects. 
Cyber Surety (3D0X3).  Supervises or operates fixed and deployed information systems and 
telecommunications resources to monitor, evaluate and maintain systems, policy and procedures 
to protect clients, networks, data/voice systems and databases from unauthorized activity. 
Administers and manages the overall Information Assurance (IA) program to include 
Communications Security (COMSEC), Emissions Security (EMSEC) and Computer Security 
(COMPUSEC) programs.  Identifies potential threats and manages resolution of security 
violations.  Enforces national, Department of Defense, and Air Force security policies and 
directives.

09.3).  TACPs are the principal Air Force liaison elements aligned with Army maneuver units 
from battalion through corps and consist of air liaison officers and enlisted terminal attack 
controllers.  TACPs advise ground commanders on the capabilities and limitations of aerospace 
power and provide the primary Air Force terminal attack control of close air support in support 
of ground force (AFDD 2-1.7). 
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—UTA is one full ANG drill weekend. When computing due 
dates, the UTA weekend on which an event initially takes place does not count.  For example, a 
reference allows for two UTAs for completion of an event.  The original decision/event occurs 
during the drill weekend in March.  The unit/individual would have until the end of the drill 
weekend in May to complete the action/response. 
White Cell—The white cell (or actual agency) will inject training events that create tactical 
problems and situations for the ASOC operations crew to resolve.  The white cell (e.g. 
Group/Squadron personnel, Distributed Training Operations Center [DTOC], Distributed 
Mission Operations Center [DMOC]), in conjunction with unit training officers/Weapons and

GRADING CRITERIA 
UNKNOWN      - Performance was not observed or the element was not performed. 
DANGEROUS   - Performance was unsafe (one element marked “Dangerous” will require an 
overall grade of “Zero”).  
GRADE 0           - Performance indicates a lack of ability or knowledge.                                               
GRADE 1           - Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency.  Makes errors of 
omission or commission. 
GRADE 2           - Performance is essentially correct.  Recognizes and corrects errors.                         
GRADE 3           - Performance is correct, efficient, skillful and without hesitation.                              
GRADE 4           - Performance reflects an unusually high degree of ability. 
 
NOTES: An overall grade of 2 or higher is required for an effective mission (GO).   
               A grade of 0 on any Mission Element in bold will result in an overall grade of 0 (NO-
