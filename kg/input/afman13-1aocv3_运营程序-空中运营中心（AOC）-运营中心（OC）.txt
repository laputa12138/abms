This Air Force Manual (AFMAN) implements guidance in Department of the Air Force Policy 
Directive (DAFPD) 13-1, Command and Control (C2) Enterprise. It provides guidance to the Air 
Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System (WS) or Operations Center (OC) that is provided by 
the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) when supporting Combatant Commanders 
(CCDRs) or when executing air, space, cyberspace (Department of the Air Force (DAF) computers 
and networks) operations, and Information Warfare (IW). This document describes the processes 
used by the AOC during normal and contingency operations. This manual applies to all civilian 
and uniformed members of the Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard 
aligned to AOC/OC units. Air Reserve Component (ARC) units may combine their local operating 
procedures with their aligned AOC/OC. This AFMAN does not apply to the United States Space 
Force. Ensure all records generated as a result of processes prescribed in this publication adhere 
to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-322, Records Management and Information Governance 
Program, and are disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, which 
is located in the Air Force Records Information Management System. Refer recommended changes 
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the DAF 
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, route DAF Forms 847 from the field 
through the appropriate functional chain of command. AOC/OC units may publish local operating 
procedures (see Chapter 10 for instructions) as a supplement to this Air Force Manual (AFMAN), 
as required. Should AOC/OC structures or procedures differ from this AFMAN, the applicable 
command shall write a supplement describing their procedures (T-1). Units producing a local 
supplement will forward copies to their parent major command (MAJCOM) for approval and

Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Genera2l.  This document describes all organizationsc, positions, responsibilities, and 
processes used by the AOC/OC across the full spectrum of military operations with a primary 
emphasis on major contingency operations. Henceforth, this AFMAN uses the term “AOC” as a 
generic term for all AOCs and OCs. During smaller-scale contingencies or day-to-day operations, 
the AOC may not employ all the capabilities or teams described herein. The AOC described in this 
AFMAN is both an Air Force (AF) unit and a WS that the COMAFFOR may employ to exercise 
control of Air Force forces (AFFOR). It may form the core of a Joint Air Operations Center 
(JAOC) or Combined AOC (CAOC) and be employed by the Combined/Joint Force Air 
Component Commander (C/JFACC) to exercise control of joint or combined air forces when 
designated. 
1.1.1.  In addition, COMAFFORs may tailor the organizational construct of their AOC team 
as required to support CCDR specific missions. The AOC normally employs with joint or 
combined augmentation, under the command of a C/JFACC. The AOC organization and 
processes described here should define the essential elements of any JAOC/CAOC, regardless 
of the service or nationality of the leadership and subordinates involved. 
1.1.2.  Many AOC activities require higher level authorities/approvals. This AFMAN 
establishes general roles and responsibilities but does not provide that authority. For the 
purpose of this AFMAN, the terms COMAFFOR, Joint Force Air Component Commander 
(JFACC), and AOC will be used only when addressing AF-specific AOC employment and 
C/JFACC and JAOC/CAOC when addressing broader, joint, or combined AOC employment. 
1.1.3.  AF doctrine recognizes that the AOC in joint or combined operations is a JAOC or 
CAOC. However, doctrine and this document simply use the term “AOC”. 
1.1.4.  When necessary to distinguish a single AOC as a C2 center from the full AOC 
enterprise, this AFMAN uses the term AOC WS for the AOC enterprise. 
1.1.5.  This AFMAN applies to teams and processes employed during steady-state operations 
and throughout the competition continuum. In support of national security policy, the USAF 
provides the full range of capabilities to commanders at all levels. 
1.1.5.1.  The USAF uses the Air Task Force as the default unit of action and the 
eXpeditionary Air Base (XAB) as USAF contribution to Joint Force Commanders (JFCs) 
to run airbases, in accordance with DAFI 36-2670, Total Force Development. C2 and other 
force elements in each XAB are primarily sourced from a single base to the maximum 
extent possible. The USAF’s offering of an XAB, when combined with assigned mission 
generation Force Elements or Demand Force Teams, is presented to JFCs as the USAF’s 
expeditionary unit of action, the Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). This framework 
presents the appropriate mix of ready forces and a means to C2 those forces. 
1.1.5.2.  The USAF will transition its C2 systems and processes across the competition 
continuum as outlined in JP 3-0. While joint and USAF doctrine state that one individual 
will normally be dual hatted as COMAFFOR and JFACC, the two responsibilities are 
different. Normally, the COMAFFOR executes operational and administrative control 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
7 
(ADCON) of assigned and attached USAF forces through the AFFOR staff. The JFACC 
executes tactical control of joint air component forces through an AOC. 
1.1.6.  Based on the tenet of centralized command, distributed control, and decentralized 
execution, the AOC, in coordination with the AFFOR staff, enables the JFACC to exercise 
operational-level C2 of air, and support to other domain forces. 
1.1.6.1.  Centralized command empowers the air component commander to respond to 
changes in the operational environment and take advantage of fleeting opportunities. 
Centralized command maximizes the allocation and apportionment of limited assets 
against prioritized target sets, increasing the flexibility and effectiveness of airpower. The 
JFACC must advocate for effective use of airpower to include deliberate planning of, and 
dynamic execution of, on-call targets. 
1.1.6.2.  Distributed control increases C2 resiliency by distributing AOC manpower, 
functions and capabilities geographically. Distributed control also enables Agile Combat 
Employment through delegation of authorities and mission responsibilities to subordinate 
commanders. 
1.1.6.3.  Decentralized execution is the delegation of authority to designated lower-level 
commanders and other tactical-level decision makers to achieve effective span of control 
and to foster disciplined initiative and tactical flexibility. 
1.1.6.4.  When combined or multinational operations are involved, the JFACC may have 
dual responsibilities as the CFACC. This AFMAN defers to JP 3-16 Multinational 
Operations and CCDR guidance on integration and information release to foreign (allied 
and coalition) partners within or as liaison to the CAOC. Finally, although this AFMAN 
briefly discusses COMAFFOR responsibilities and Component Headquarters organization, 
its focus is on the AOC. 
1.2.  C/JFACC Roles And Responsibilities. 
1.2.1.  Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) Employment. When 
conducting combined and joint air, space, and cyberspace operations, the JFC normally 
designates a JFACC in accordance with JP 3-30, Joint Air Operations. During air operations, 
the COMAFFOR, if designated as the C/JFACC, will plan and execute through the AOC in 
the role of CAOC. The joint air tasking cycle will be used as the baseline process for the CAOC 
or Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC), which is initiated by JFC formal guidance to all 
functional component commands. This guidance is refined to weight of effort determination 
by the C/JFACC as a draft apportionment recommendation to the JFC, which drives air asset 
allocation to plan the ATO. The JFC approves the draft apportionment recommendation 
provided by the C/JFACC. 
1.2.2.  The C/JFACC executes responsibilities through the AOC to include, but not limited to, 
the following.: 
1.2.2.1.  Develop the Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP). 
1.2.2.2.  Coordinate with other component commanders and then develop apportionment 
recommendation for the joint air effort. 
1.2.2.3.  Provide centralized direction for the allocation and tasking of capabilities and 
forces made available. 
8 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
1.2.2.4.  Provide control, oversight, and guidance during the execution of joint air, space, 
and cyberspace operations. 
1.2.2.5.  Coordinate and integrate JAOP with the operations of other component 
commanders and forces. 
1.2.2.6.  Assess operational and tactical results of JAOP. 
1.2.2.7.  Function as supported and supporting commander as directed. 
1.2.2.8.  Produce the Air Operations Directive (AOD). 
1.2.2.9.  Produce the ATO, ATO Network-Enabled Weapon Supplement (ATONEWS), 
Airspace Control Plan (ACP), Airspace Control Order (ACO), and other plans and orders 
as required. 
1.3.  Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) Additional Responsibilities 
Supported by an AOC.  Normally, the JFC assigns additional responsibilities associated with air 
operations to the JFACC, making the JFACC the supported commander for these functions. In 
addition to these delegated responsibilities, the JFACC may also be required to provide specialized 
support to other components. 
1.3.1.  Area Air Defense Commander (AADC)  . Due to the inherent linkage of air operations 
and defensive counterair, the JFC normally designates the COMAFFOR as the JFACC and as 
the AADC to conduct defensive counterair for the joint force. The AADC has overall 
responsibility for air and missile defense of the Joint Operations Area (JOA) or Area Of 
Responsibility (AOR). The JFACC employs the AOC to coordinate with other components 
and develop the Area Air Defense Plan (AADP), which includes defensive counterair inputs 
from all sources for JFC approval. Once approved, the AOC plans, coordinates, and manages 
defensive counterair operations (ISO AADC) simultaneously to offensive counterair 
operations (ISO JFACC). 
1.3.2.  Airspace Control Authority (ACA)  . The JFC normally designates the COMAFFOR 
as the ACA. The ACA has overall responsibility for planning and controlling the airspace in 
the AOR/JOA and operation of the Airspace Control System in the airspace control area. The 
ACA coordinates, develops, and issues the ACP and ACO, which provide guidance and 
procedures for use and control of airspace activities. 
1.3.3.  Collection Operations Management  . In accordance with JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence, 
collection operations management is the direction, scheduling, and control of specific 
collection operations and associated processing, exploitation, analysis and production, and 
dissemination resources. In accordance with JP 3-30, the JFACC will normally be the 
supported commander for the airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) 
effort. The JFC will normally delegate collection operations management for joint airborne 
ISR to the JFACC to authoritatively direct, schedule, and control collection operations for use 
by the J-2 in associated processing, exploitation, and reporting. 
1.3.4.  Collection Requirements Management  . The JFACC will also likely exercise 
collection requirements management of assigned units and receive collection requirements 
from other collection requirements management authorities. In accordance with JP 2-0, 
collection requirements management is the authoritative development and control of collection 
processing, exploitation, analysis and production, and/or reporting requirements. These 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
9 
requirements normally result in either the direct tasking of assets over which the collection 
manager has authority, or the generation of tasking requests to the collection management 
authority at higher, lower, or lateral echelon to accomplish the collection mission. See Chapter 
6 for an explanation of the ISR Division's (ISRD) roles, responsibilities, and processes. 
1.3.5.  Space Coordinating Authority (SCA)  . The Joint Force Space Component Commander 
(JFSCC) is normally designated as SCA and is responsible for coordinating and integrating 
space capabilities. joint space operations, and integration of space capabilities and effects in 
support of the JFC. The Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC) and the space liaison 
element to the AOC normally support the SCA, who serves as the focal point for gathering 
space requirements in support of the JFC’s campaign. These requirements include: 
1.3.5.1.  Requesting space capabilities to support joint warfighter functions and requests 
for space forces with specialized skills. 
1.3.5.2.  To ensure timely support, the Commander, US Space Command, will employ 
Joint Integrated Space Teams as operational liaisons to the supported Combatant 
Command(s). 
1.3.5.3.  Additionally, as allocated by US Space Force, a JFSCC may be established with 
the COMSPACEFOR designated as the SCA. In the absence of this force presentation, 
SECAF recommendations are that the COMAFFOR be designated as SCA in the absence 
of a USSF COMSPACEFOR. The designated Component Commander with joint force 
Space Coordinating Authority develops a recommended prioritized list of space 
requirements and capabilities based on JFC objectives and Commander, US Space 
Command’s operational needs. 
1.3.6.  Electromagnetic Attack Control Authority  . In accordance with JP 3-85, Joint 
Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations, the Electronic Warfare (EW) Control Authority is the 
commander designated to assume overall responsibility for the operation of electronic attack 
assets in the JOA/AOR. This responsibility assumes the EW Control Authority can access the 
Joint Automated Communication-Electronics Operating Instructions System and Joint 
Restricted Frequency List, can analyze immediate jamming requests for frequency interference 
issues (to include harmonic interference), and can ensure positive C2 of jamming assets to 
start/stop jamming activity. 
1.3.7.  Supported Commander for Personnel Recovery  . If the JFC designates the 
COMAFFOR as the supported commander for Personnel Recovery (PR), the COMAFFOR 
will integrate the Joint Personnel Recovery Center into the AOC in support of JFACC JAOP. 
The AOC must also retain a Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell capability to plan and 
conduct Personnel Recovery missions in support of USAF (i.e., COMAFFOR) operations. 
1.3.8.  Provision of a Joint Air Component Coordination Element (JACCE): 
1.3.8.1.  The JFACC may establish and deploy a JACCE to service land, maritime, and 
special operations component commanders’ headquarters (HQ) to integrate air with space, 
cyberspace, surface, and subsurface operations. 
1.3.8.2.  The JFACC may also establish and deploy a JACCE to the JFC or a Coalition 
Partner HQ to integrate air operations within the overall joint or combined force. 
10 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
1.3.8.3.  The JACCE will normally be sourced from the Air Force Component 
commander’s AOC or AFFOR staff, augmentation units or air expeditionary center/Air 
Force Personnel Center-identified personnel as well as subject matter experts (SMEs) from 
each of the sister services as needed. 
1.3.8.4.  If possible, the COMAFFOR/JFACC should establish a working relationship with 
JACCE personnel before deployment and execution. The JACCE director acts as the 
JFACC’s liaison and primary representative to the other commanders in the operation. The 
JACCE team facilitates interaction and communication between the respective staffs. The 
JACCE performs a liaison function and is responsible for understanding (and participating 
in, if possible) the JFC/JFACC's initial planning other commanders’ plans. The JACCE 
team works with their respective counterparts in the AOC and AFFOR staff to provide the 
other HQs commander information on the best way to employ air power. This is a two-way 
relationship in that the JACCE only provides information flow to the JFACC but must also 
help ensure JFACC information is flowing to and understood by the JFC, Joint Force Land 
Component Commander, Joint Force Maritime Component Commander, and/or Joint 
Force Special Operations Component Commander as applicable. JACCE will participate 
in training events and exercises with appropriate HQ organizations to maintain mission 
readiness. 
1.4.  AOC WS Program Responsibilities. 
1.4.1.  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics 
(SAF/AQ)  . SAF/AQ assigns the Program Executive Officer and designates the AOC WS 
Program Manager who leads the AOC WS Program Office for AOC systems development, 
integration, testing, fielding, sustainment, modernization, and certification to participate in the 
overall USAF C2 enterprise. Currently, the AOC WS Program Manager is Air Force Life 
Cycle Management Center /HBB and the Program Executive Officer is the Air Force Program 
Executive Officer for Battle Management. For specific Program Manager responsibilities, see 
Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5000.87, Operation of the Software Acquisition 
Pathway and DAFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. SAF/AQ will provide 
additional guidance as required. 
1.4.2.  Headquarters Air Force  . AF/A3TE Exercises and Training Division provides policy, 
guidance, and advocacy for the AOC WS. This division is the Headquarters Air Force 
Functional Area Manager for the AOC WS. AF/A3TE is the responsible Headquarters Air 
Force Directorate for AOC functional areas to include organizational constructs, crew 
constructs, training, operations and maintenance (MX) funding, Unit Type Code approval, 
special experience identifier approval and other related issues. Other Headquarters Air Force 
staff agencies provide support as required. AOCs may request Air Force Operations Digital 
Enterprise (AF/A3X) participation in AOC WS forums. AF/A3X is responsible for

Chapter 2 
AIR OPERATIONS CENTER 
2.1.  Mission.  An AOC is the COMAFFOR’s C2 center and is under the Tactical Control 
(TACON) of the C/JFACC when the COMAFFOR has been designated as C/JFACC. The AOC 
operates as a fully integrated command center providing the C/JFACC the capability to plan, 
direct, and assess the activities of assigned and attached forces. AOCs do not work in isolation. 
They require appropriate connectivity to the AFFOR staff, higher headquarters (HHQ) operations 
centers (e.g., to the joint force headquarters for the operational branch, and to senior Air Force 
headquarters for the administrative branch), to other joint/coalition force components, to assigned 
and attached Air Force units, to Tactical C2 nodes and Wing Operations Centers, and to global 
and geographic AOCs as necessary. The AOC provides operational-level C2 of air, and 
coordinates space, cyberspace and IW to meet C/JFACC operational objectives and guidance. To 
efficiently and effectively plan and execute their missions, commanders must tailor geographic 
and global AOCs. The AOC planning effort is managed through a battle rhythm which can vary 
for each operation or contingency. The AOC schedule/battle rhythm is driven by C/JFACC and 
JFC battle rhythms. Although the USAF provides the core personnel for the AOC, other service 
and combined force components provide personnel in support of exercises and contingency 
operations. Actions at the joint/combined force level establish the requirements for the Theater Air 
Ground System (see Paragraph 2.4.). Requirements include the CCDR’s guidance, perspective, 
and strategy for the AOR or if designated JOA, command organization and relationships, campaign 
plan, assignment of objectives, and apportionment of forces. The AOC will lead the air tasking 
cycle to: 
2.1.1.  Develop strategy and planning documents across the competition continuum (JP 3-0, 
Joint Operations) to integrate air, space, cyberspace, IW, ground, and maritime operations to 
meet JFACC objectives in support of CCDR or JFC Guidance. (T-2) 
2.1.2.  Plan, task, integrate, and execute air component operations; provide rapid reaction, 
positive control, and coordinate and deconflict weapons employment. (T-2) 
2.1.3.  Receive, assemble, analyze, filter, and disseminate all-source intelligence and 
meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) information to support air operations planning, 
execution, and assessment. (T-2) 
2.1.4.  Issue airspace control procedures and coordinate airspace control activities for the ACA 
when the COMAFFOR is designated the ACA. (T-2) 
2.1.5.  Integrate space and cyberspace capabilities and coordinate space and cyberspace 
activities for the JFACC.(T-2) 
2.1.6.  Issue space operations procedures and coordinate space operations activities for space 
coordination authority, when the COMAFFOR is designated the Space Coordination 
Authority.(T-2) 
2.1.7.  When designated as the AADC, the C/JFACC will provide overall direction, through 
the AADP, for air and missile defense, including ballistic missile defense. (T-2) 
14 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
2.1.8.  Plan, task, and execute the theater airborne intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance missions, and integrate national technical means into JFACC planning and 
execution of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. (T-2) 
2.1.9.  Conduct operational and tactical assessment to evaluate progress of operations relative 
to established air campaign objectives and specified timelines. (T-2) 
2.1.10.  Produce and disseminate AOD, ATOs, ACOs, Special Instructions (SPINS), 
Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Annexes, Mission-Type Orders, 
and (as required) Operational Tasking Data Link (OPTASKLINK), and any associated 
changes. (T-2) 
2.1.11.  Plan, task, and direct execution of air mobility operations according to the theater 
priorities. (T-2) 
2.1.12.  Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-3/3-1, AOC Combat 
Fundamentals-Air Operations Center (AOC), offers tactics, techniques and procedures, and 
unit standard operating procedures detail specific functions of the AOC. See Figure 2.1.

2.2.  Component Headquarters Organizations.  AF components to Combatant Commands are 
designated a Component Major Command (C-MAJCOM, e.g., Pacific Air Forces), or a 
Component NAF (e.g., 12 AF, 16 AF). The AF Component Headquarters will include, at a 
minimum, the ability to exercise command and control (normally an AOC or OC) and an AFFOR 
staff. Component Headquarters will be properly structured, equipped, manned, and trained to 
execute C2 of air, space, and cyberspace operations assigned or attached to the AF component 
commander for day-to-day operations with the ability to accept additional forces for any increase 
in AF component mission tasking or direction. AF component functions will be integrated into 
existing MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force structures defined in AFI 38-101, Manpower and 
Organization, and AFI 13-103, Air Component Headquarters AFFOR Staff Operations, Readiness 
and Structures. Figure 2.2 shows an example of a Component Major Command/ Component 
Numbered AF as a Component Headquarters. 
2.2.1.  AFFOR Staff  . The AFFOR staff, in coordination with the AOC, supports USAF 
requirements and integrates air component capabilities into the CCDR’s joint force planning. 
The AFFOR staff implements and establishes COMAFFOR policies and procedures 
(supplemental to CCDR policies and procedures) within the theater of operations. The AFFOR 
staff also plans, organizes, conducts and assesses campaign activities in support of the CCDR’s 
campaign plan and conducts service, joint and multinational exercises. Refer to AFI 13-103, 
and Numbered Air Force Supplements.

2.3.  AOC Organization.  The AOC organization includes an AOC/CC, five divisions (Strategy; 
Combat Plans; Combat Operations; Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; and Air 
Mobility), command staff and multiple specialty and support teams. Depending upon Combatant 
Command guidance, each AOC will configure appropriately and integrate numerous disciplines 
in a cross-functional team approach to monitor, assess, plan and execute (see Figure 2.3. AOC 
Organization and Functional Teams). Later chapters discuss the specific organization and 
processes for each AOC division. This volume lists only primary, recommended, personnel or 
crewmember AFSCs. The unit’s Unit Type Code will codify additional and suitable substitute 
crew position AFSCs. 
2.3.1.  Note:  Not all of the organizations and capabilities shown in Figure 2.3 may exist in an 
AOC during peacetime and/or major contingency operations because of the specific scope or 
mission of that AOC in support of CCDR requirements. 
2.3.2.  Note:  UMD A-prefixed positions are an authorized AFSC substitution for AOC 
positions, both rated and non-rated officers, based on higher headquarters guidance, 
MAJCOM, and AOC commander’s approval.

2.3.4.  Strategy Division  . The SRD Chief and personnel concentrate on both long-range and 
near-term planning throughout the competition continuum of air, space, and cyberspace 
operations to achieve theater objectives by developing, refining, disseminating, and assessing 
the JFACC strategy guidance. The SRD, through collaboration with the Combat Plans Division 
Targeting Effects Team (TET), submits recommended draft apportionment to the JFACC. The 
JFACC presents the draft air apportionment recommendation to the C/JFC. Ideally, guidance 
and apportionment input will be reflected in C/JFC guidance, making AOD preparation more 
efficient. The SRD applies JAOP content, C/JFC guidance, JFACC interpretation, TET chief’s 
targeting scheme, and intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB), and writes the AOD. 
The SRD works and coordinates with representatives from ISR, Non-Kinetic Operations 
(NKO), space, cyberspace, judge advocate (JA), and each service/functional component. The 
SRD, in coordination with the TET chief, recommends tactical tasks as required by the TET 
chief’s targeting scheme for this ATO and prioritized IAW the existing JAOP prioritization. 
Next, components nominate targets matched to published objectives and tasks. Primary SRD 
activities produce the JAOP, AOD, and the operational assessment report. The SRD consists 
of three teams: strategy plans team (SPT), strategy guidance team (SGT), and operational 
assessment team (OAT). Chapter 3 contains a more detailed discussion of SRD. 
2.3.5.  Combat Plans Division (CPD)  . The CPD Chief and personnel have the responsibility 
for near-term AOC planning (within 48 hours prior to ATO execution). CPD consists of four 
teams: TET, Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) Team, ATO Production Team, and C2 Plans 
Team. The primary products of CPD processes are the ATO/ATONEWS, ACO, ACP, joint 
integrated prioritized target list (JIPTL), SPINS, and inputs to operational tasking data link 
messages. See Chapter 4 for an in-depth discussion on the CPD. 
2.3.6.  Combat Operations Division  . The COD Chief and/or Chief of Combat Operations 
(CCO) (there may be more than one CCO, but only one division chief) and COD personnel 
concentrate on execution of the current ATO/ATONEWS and ACO (e.g., the 24-hour 
execution period of the ATO). The COD consists of four teams: Offensive Operations Team, 
Defensive Operations Team, Component Joint Data Network Team (Joint Data Network Team 
manages CTP), and the Senior Intelligence Duty Officer (SIDO) team. See Chapter 5 for an 
in-depth discussion on the COD. 
2.3.7.  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Division  . The Chief of ISRD (CISR) 
and ISR personnel are responsible for assessing and anticipating adversary activity in the 
operational environment, planning ISR operations, and developing dynamic target strategies 
to rapidly, discreetly and efficiently achieve the JFACC/JFC priority effects. The ISRD is 
comprised of three teams: Analysis, Correlation, and Fusion (ACF) Team; Targets/Tactical 
Assessment (TGT/TA) Team; and ISR Operations Team. Additionally, as mission needs 
dictate, the ISRD integrates ISR personnel within other teams in the AOC. See Chapter 6 for 
an in-depth discussion on the ISRD. 
22 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
2.3.8.  Air Mobility Division  . The AMD plans, coordinates, tasks, and executes air mobility 
missions in accordance with the JFACC’s guidance and intent. Airlift requirements are planned 
and executed in a parallel process managed by the AMD and integrated into the air tasking 
cycle. Theater movement validation authority is typically delegated by the C/JFC to the joint 
deployment and distribution operations center. The joint deployment and distribution 
operations center provides C/JFC prioritization guidance to the AMD and produces the joint 
integrated prioritized requirements list (JIPRL) in coordination with the AMD for intratheater 
movement planning. Additionally, the AMD coordinates intertheater air mobility missions 
with the 618 AOC, Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC). The AMD consists of four teams: 
Airlift Control Team (ALCT), Air Refueling Control Team (ARCT), Aeromedical Evacuation 
Control Team (AECT), and Air Mobility Control Team (AMCT). Additionally, as mission 
needs dictate, the AMD will integrate personnel throughout other divisions. See Chapter 7 for 
an in-depth discussion on the AMD. 
2.3.9.  Information Warfare (IW)  . IAW CSAF signed USAF IW Strategy (July 2022), Air 
Force IW consists of six principal capabilities: cyberspace operations; electromagnetic 
spectrum operations (EMSO); information operations; public affairs (PA); intelligence; and 
weather (WX). There are numerous other information capabilities and organizations that 
inform and support the employment of these six capabilities. IW represents an overarching set 
of capabilities that must be integrated across all AOC divisions and teams. 
2.3.9.1.  IW involves the systematic consideration and coordination of all planned verbal, 
visual, and symbolic activities, employed at the operational and tactical levels, to convey 
themes, intentions, messages or meet behavior-related operational objectives. IW is a way 
to unify operational planning, and integrate all capabilities, in order to achieve desired 
objects or ends; do not consider it a non-kinetic capability. 
2.3.9.2.  Operational planners consider the use of tools, techniques, and operational 
activities employed across the information environment to create expected behavioral 
effects and operationally desirable conditions. Planners also assess the adversary’s 
behaviors in response to the blue-force application of kinetic and/or non-kinetic capabilities 
and activities. Development of operational objectives, Measure(s) Of Effectiveness 
(MOEs), Measures(s) Of Performance (MOPs), and tasks will support the C/JFACC’s IW 
concept of operations, and will be integrated throughout the JAOP, AOD, AADP, SPINs 
and MAAP.

Chapter 3 
STRATEGY DIVISION 
3.1.  General.  Strategy is the art and science of employing the instruments of national power in a 
synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve theater and/or national objectives. The SRD leads 
joint air planning and the JFACC process of arranging ends, ways, means, and risk to define 
courses of action (COAs) to achieve an end state or end states. The division produces a set of 
COAs the JFACC can select or modify to achieve JFC and JFACC objectives. The SRD 
concentrates on joint planning of JAOP to achieve JFACC and JFC objectives. To support all 
phases of a JFC’s campaign, the SRD develops, refines, disseminates, and assesses the JFACC’s 
air, space, and cyberspace operations strategy. During joint planning, the SRD leads the Air 
Planning Group (APG) in the application of operational design and the joint planning process for 
air to conduct mission analysis (MA), course(s) of action development, analysis and selection, 
create a Concept of Operations for orders development, and ultimately produce a valid and feasible 
JAOP. The SRD works with higher HQ, AFFOR staff, and other service component staffs, to 
develop and integrate the air course of action and subsequent JAOP inputs. At least one ISR expert 
should be embedded into the SRD. Best practices have shown that embedding ensures full 
integration to meet JFC and mission requirements. During execution, the SRD will keep the 
strategy and planning current, produce and update the AOD, and provide operational assessment 
across the competition continuum. (T-2) 
3.2.  Major SRD Process Inputs.  Key inputs include higher headquarters policy, planning 
directives, guidance and intent, tasking, joint intelligence preparation of the operational 
environment, and ROE/Rules for the Use of Force (RUF). Inputs also include other service/global 
component planning documentation, as appropriate. Within the AOC, the SRD receives the target 
developers’ target system analysis and TET’s inputs for the apportionment recommendation to the 
JFACC. In addition, the SRD receives analytical, targeting, and collection management support 
from the ISRD; combat support status information on assigned and attached USAF forces from 
the AOC Logistics-Combat Support Team, AFFOR staff A4, and friendly force status from 
AFFOR staff and other component liaisons. For operational assessment, inputs will be designed in 
accordance with the operational assessment plan (OAP) and include tactical assessment and other 
appropriate reports and performance measurement summaries. Coordinate cyberspace operations 
portions of JFACC plans through the Combatant Command-level Joint Cyber Center (JCC) for 
offensive cyber operations and the 616 OC for defensive cyber operations. 
3.3.  SRD Processes.  The SRD Chief and subordinate teams will develop, refine, disseminate, 
and assess the progress of the JFACC’s strategy. The SRD will: 
3.3.1.  Develop the joint air estimate of the situation to produce a recommended JFC course of 
action. (T-2) 
3.3.2.  Translate strategic, JFC, and JFACC guidance into objectives, tasks, and assessment 
measures and indicators. (T-2) 
3.3.3.  Develop and coordinate the joint air estimate of the situation that recommends a course 
of action for the JFC. (T-2) 
3.3.4.  Lead the development of the approved JFACC course of action into a comprehensive 
JAOP or order with appropriate annexes. (T-2) 
28 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
3.3.5.  Liaise and integrate as required. Successful accomplishment of each of the above 
processes requires liaising with higher headquarters, other components and AFFOR staff. (T-2) 
3.3.6.  Develop alternative contingency plans, branches and sequels. (T-2) 
3.3.7.  Develop proposed changes to the ROE/RUF and JFACC delegation of authority plans. 
(T-2) 
3.3.8.  During execution, provide the JFACC a recommended air apportionment in each AOD. 
(T-2) 
3.3.9.  During execution and normally daily, direct, develop, coordinate, publish, and as 
necessary update the AOD. (T-2) 
3.3.10.  Integrate other component air requirements into the AOD. (T-2) 
3.3.11.  Monitor progress of the air plan and make an operational assessment in relation to 
achieving the JFC/JFACC objectives. (T-2) 
3.3.12.  Fully integrate NKO planning throughout entire planning process to produce a 
comprehensive JAOP, and subsequently, the AODs. (T-2) 
3.4.  Major Strategy Division (SRD) Process Outputs.  Key outputs include the JAOP, AOD, 
JFACC apportionment recommendation, ROE/RUF changes, Commander Critical Information 
Requirements and operational assessment products. In addition, the SRD will develop branch 
plans, sequel plans, and special projects and studies as required. (T-2) A brief description of the 
key outputs follows. 
3.4.1.  JAOP. Joint air, space, IO, and cyberspace operations constitute an integral part of the 
JFC’s plan of operations. The JFC normally assigns JFACC responsibility for joint air 
planning, for joint space planning when delegated Space Control Authority, and a supporting 
role in cyberspace planning. The JAOP documents the JFACC’s plan to integrate and 
coordinate air, space, IO, and cyberspace operations across all the phases of the JFC’s 
campaign. The SRD writes the JAOP based on the strategy-to-task methodology, which 
consists of objectives, effects, and tasks, along with appropriate assessment criteria that enable 
an assessment of progress toward achieving objectives and effects. Products developed in 
leading up to JAOP approval include the Mission Analysis Brief, COA Decision Brief, and the 
Commander’s Estimate. 
3.4.2.  Air Apportionment Recommendation. The SRD formulates the air apportionment 
recommendation that the JFACC submits to the JFC for upcoming iterations of the joint tasking 
cycle. The JFC is the final approval authority for the air apportionment decision. 
3.4.3.  ROE/RUF: The SRD is responsible for developing the ROE/RUF. JA advising SRD are 
responsible to support development and modifications to the ROE/RUF. The JAG will make 
updates to the ROE/RUF recommended by the ROE/RUF cell and submit them for publication 
in a timely manner. An edited version of the ROE/RUF will be provided to the C2 Plans Team 
for publication in the SPINS. The ROE/RUF will be published in the JAOP. 
3.4.4.  Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIR). SRD has the lead to develop 
and maintain JFACC CCIRs. Two key subcomponents of CCIRs are Priority Intelligence 
Requirements (PIR) and friendly forces information requirements. SRD will coordinate 
JFACC CCIRs across the AOC. ISRD will have special interest in supporting JFACC priority 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
29 
intelligence requirements. The SRD may coordinate JFACC CCIRs with the AFFOR staff; 
however, the staff should be developing a separate CCIR list to support COMAFFOR decision-
making. 
3.4.5.  AOD. The AOD is JFACC’s written guidance and forms the foundational direction for 
the air tasking cycle and ensures air operations effectively support the combined/JFC’s 
objectives while retaining enough flexibility to adjust across the competition continuum. The 
AOD provides JFACC guidance and intent, concept of operations, prioritized operational 
objectives and tasks, as well as their measures of effectiveness / measures of performance and 
coordinating instructions for the ATO/ATONEWS execution. 
3.4.6.  Operational assessment products. Operational assessment is the process of relating 
tactical tasks to operational effects. Operational assessment products consist of operational 
assessment briefings and operational assessment reports, which normally contain MOE and 
MOP from the JAOP and the guidance provided from JFC to JFACC. These products evaluate 
the JFACC strategy, track progress toward operational and strategic objectives, and make 
recommendations for strategy adjustments and future action. Forward the completed 
operational assessment report based on JFC guidance to the JFC and designated Joint Force 
Assessment Board representative. 
3.5.  Strategy Division (SRD) Organization.  The SRD Chief leads SRD and usually organizes 
it into three functionally oriented teams: SPT, SGT, and OAT (See Figure 3.1. SRD Organization, 
Functional Teams, and Major Processes). Although the AOC Commander may administratively 
assign the NKO Team to the SRD, it is a specialty team that provides functional expertise across 
all divisions within the AOC as discussed in Chapter 8.

divisions and specialty/support teams to produce a coherent, executable plan that meets the 
commander’s guidance and intent. (T-3) 
3.5.1.5.  Ensure the SRD battle rhythm is sufficient to accomplish JAOP development, 
branch and sequel planning, APG requirements, AOD development, operational 
assessment, and special projects, as required. (T-3) 
3.5.1.6.  Ensure each of the SRD outputs (e.g., JAOP, AOD, operational assessment 
products) correctly convey JFACC’s guidance and intent. (T-3) 
3.5.1.7.  Establish procedures to secure the JFACC and/or AOC commander approval prior 
to publication/release, as appropriate. (T-3) 
3.5.1.8.  Ensure positional guides, worksheets, and procedural checklists are developed by 
SRD teams, reviewed, and updated for all appropriate duty positions. (T-3) 
3.5.1.9.  File critical planning materials, such as draft and record documents, slides or 
briefing materials, minutes from meetings as determined by the KMP. (T-3) 
3.5.1.10.  Ensure SRD KMP is consistent with the larger AOC plan and meets 
requirements. (T-3) 
3.5.1.11.  Identify SRD manning requirements and fill positions with trained and qualified 
personnel. (T-3) 
3.5.1.12.  Ensure SRD facilities and equipment meet requirements. (T-3) 
3.5.1.13.  Consider ATO Coordinators a critical resource for conduct of the air tasking 
cycle. Involve ATO coordinators in near-term planning to improve common understanding 
of JFACC guidance and intent across the AOC divisions. (T-3) 
3.5.2.  Strategy Plans Team  . The SPT consists of a small group of assigned members along 
with a tailored group of attached members. The SPT’s primary focus is long-term planning 
(beyond 72 hours) or “future plans.” The SPT will develop and maintain operational-level joint 
strategy, air plan, and associated branch and sequel plans that support the JFC and JFACC 
objectives. They lead the Air Planning Group and coordinate/support higher headquarters’ 
Joint Planning Group, other components’ planning groups, and AFFOR staff Operational 
Planning Group as appropriate for the JFACC during joint planning. SPT will write branch and 
sequel plans that support JFACC and JFC objectives. (T-3) 
3.5.2.1.  Strategy Plans Team Chief. (AFSC: 11/12/13B). (Rank: O-5). (Advanced Studies 
Group [advanced air and space studies graduate or equivalent] highly desired). The SPT 
Chief reports to the SRD Chief and ensures the SPT successfully fulfills its responsibilities 
and the processes, as well as any other assignments by SRD Chief. SPT is the JFACC’s 
focal point for joint planning (via the Air Planning Group) and serves as the primary 
interface with the Joint Planning Group and Operational Planning Group (if established). 
32 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
3.5.2.2.  SPT Members. (AFSC: 11/12/13). (Rank: O-4/O-5). The SPT Chief trains core 
members in wartime planning and its requirements. Additionally, SPT receives support 
from attached ISRD, special technical operations (STO), and NKO Team personnel. Other 
AOC divisions, service components, other government agencies, coalition force 
components, and specialty functions such as space or cyberspace may augment SPT to 
support Joint Task Force or contingency operations. 
3.5.2.3.  SPT Responsibilities. The SPT’s principal function is the development and MX 
of operational-level, long-range joint air plans, and associated branch and sequel plans that 
support the JFC and JFACC objectives. The SPT leads the AOC in the air estimate process 
and the associated development of the JAOP to include a prioritized, effects-based, 
targeting scheme. The JAOP is the air component’s portion of the JFC’s Operations Plan 
(OPLAN) or campaign plan. SPT must have a deliberate process for providing operational 
and tactical objectives, conditions, timeline, and priorities. Examples can include Strat-to-
Task planning and/or phased air targeting scheme methodologies in coordination with 
TET. These inputs feed the development of the air apportionment recommendation. 
Because these long-range strategies and branch plans complement the JAOP, the SPT 
supports development of the AADP and ACP. During operations execution, the SPT 
operates beyond the 72-96 hour (ATO execution) period. The SPT integrates non-kinetic 
plans with overall air operation as directed by the JFACC. Under the Component 
Headquarters construct, the SPT may support the planning of global strike missions in 
conjunction with Geographic CCDRs and United States Strategic Command. 
3.5.2.4.  SPT Processes. The SPT will: 
3.5.2.4.1.  Liaise, support, coordinate, and integrate planning with higher headquarters 
Joint Planning Group, component Operational Planning Group, and AFFOR 
Operational Planning Group. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.2.  Support Air Planning Group/ Joint Planning Group /component liaisons for 
air operations planning. Conduct operational design and problem framing activities 
with the JFC, JFACC and other components as required. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.3.  Lead the AOC in all aspects of joint planning process for air as required. 
(T-3) 
3.5.2.4.3.1.  Develop JFACC’s mission, intent, objectives, and concept of 
operations. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.3.2.  Develop and coordinate the JFACC air estimate of the situation that 
recommends a course of action for JFC approval. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.3.3.  Use strategy-to-task methodology to develop objectives and tasks, to 
include assessment measures, in conjunction with the OAT and TET. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.3.4.  Develop detailed phase plans. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.3.5.  Coordinate the development of the approved JFACC course of action 
into a comprehensive JAOP or order with appropriate annexes. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.4.  Develop air apportionment recommendations based on the phased air-
targeting scheme from TET. Air apportionment is the daily recommended utilization 
of air assets in accordance with the approved JAOP. The planning for air apportionment 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
33 
begins during pre-execution, as early as COA development, and continues as an 
iterative process during the development of the JAOP as well as branch planning. SPT 
continuously refines apportionment recommendations based on phasing, operational 
assessment reports, intelligence inputs, munition expenditures, JFC priorities, etc. and 
works with SGT to incorporate apportionment as well as commander’s guidance into 
the AOD. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.5.  Develop alternative contingency plans such as branch and sequel plans. 
(T-3) 
3.5.2.4.6.  Lead the ROE cell to develop recommended changes to the ROE/RUF. ROE 
cell composition will vary with each situation, but should include a member of the 
Judge Advocate (JA) team at a minimum. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.7.  Lead the development and coordination of JFACC Commander’s Critical 
Information Requirements. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.8.  Ensure consistency between the JAOP and other plans (e.g., the C2 Plans 
developed ACP and AADP). (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.9.  Work with SGT and OAT to keep plans current. (T-3) 
3.5.2.4.10.  Anticipate changes in the battlespace to foresee the progress of the air 
operation and identify any potential problems to the JFACC. (T-3) 
3.5.3.  Strategy Guidance Team  . The SGT normally consists of a small group of assigned 
members and has a near term focus (from 48-72 hours), or “future operations.” SGT operates 
within the current phase of the operation and will develop, coordinate and disseminate the 
AOD, which contains the JFACC guidance for the ATO. SGT will ensure that AOD guidance 
reflects the latest guidance, concept of operations, priorities, and operational assessment. (T-3) 
3.5.3.1.  Strategy Guidance Team Chief. (AFSC: 11/12/13B). (Rank: O-5). The SGT Chief 
reports to the SRD Chief and ensures the SGT accomplishes the team’s responsibilities and 
processes. The SGT Chief should attend JFACC guidance meetings. 
3.5.3.2.  SGT Members. (AFSC: 11/12/13/14). (Rank O-4/O-5). The SGT Chief trains core 
members in wartime AOD development and its requirements. The SGT should ensure the 
AOD is disseminated with sufficient time to allow development of component target 
nominations and proactive mission planning by tasked units. Every effort should be made 
to produce the AOD within its planned time frame to enable subsequent joint air tasking 
cycle teams and processes. Additionally, SGT receives support from all other AOC 
divisions, service components, other government agencies, coalition components, and 
specialty functions and teams as required. 
3.5.3.3.  SGT Responsibilities. As annotated above, the SGT operates within the current 
phase of the operation. Additionally, a SGT team member should attend the Joint Effects 
Collaboration Board to synchronize the AOD with the JFC’s targeting scheme of 
maneuver. 
3.5.3.4.  SGT Processes. SGT synchronizes and integrates JFACC guidance and objectives 
throughout the Joint air tasking cycle. The SGT will: 
3.5.3.4.1.  Support SPT during joint planning as required. (T-3) 
34 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
3.5.3.4.2.  Conduct regular, scheduled meetings with AOC, AFFOR staff and liaison 
teams to develop and coordinate the near term guidance, concept of operations, 
priorities, weights of effort and other guidance for the AOD. (T-3) 
3.5.3.4.3.  Lead the AOD Working Group. One of the outputs is the prioritization for 
ATO execution based on the JAOP or SPT’s planning guidance. Develop, coordinate, 
update and gain JFACC approval of the AOD and disseminate it when approved. (T-3) 
3.5.3.4.4.  Attend other AOC meetings (e.g., TET) as necessary/available to clarify 
guidance questions. (T-3) 
3.5.4.  Operational Assessment Team  . The OAT normally consists of a small group of 
assigned members and has both a long and near term focus. The OAT will analyze the 
effectiveness of past and present JAOP, combine this analysis with a look at future plans and 
future operations, and recommend adjustments to plans and guidance to achieve the desired 
end state conditions. OAT will assess progress of operations relative to established objectives 
within the specified period. OAT should answer three basic questions: (1) Are we doing “things

5.5.1.  COD Chief and Chief of Combat Operations  (CCO) (AFSC: 11/12/13B). (Rank: O-
5/O-6). The COD Chief is directly responsible to the AOC/CC for the direction and supervision 
of combat operations. Normally, there is only one COD Chief but there can be numerous CCOs 
during increased operations. COD Chief and CCO will apply JFACC guidance to ensure 
current tactical air, space, and non-kinetic operations attain established objectives at the 
operational-level of war. (T-2) The CCO is responsible to the COD Chief and is the senior 
position on the COD operations floor. The CCO monitors the current situation and advises the 
AOC/CC of dynamic mission requirements and the status of resources. Note: There may be 
time-critical issues that require the CCO to interface directly with the JFACC, especially when 
changes are made to the ATO/ATONEWS that change (or appear to change) guidance from 
the JFACC. The primary considerations in the CCO’s approval of any adjustment to the 
ATO/ATONEWS are battlespace dynamics and JFACC/JFC guidance. Continuous 
communication and timely coordination with JFACC, AFFOR staff, AOC/CC, and associated 
component staffs are essential to ensure combat support forces can generate and sustain combat 
operations. Although the following list may vary somewhat depending on theater specifics, the 
CCO will:

Network (JDN) Operations; and JTIDS network design library. The generation and display of 
a CTP within the Joint Task Force headquarters, shared with the JTF’s component 
commanders, and forwarded to the CCDR as an input to the Common Operational Picture 
enables operational situational awareness. A CTP consists of a collection of air, space, land, 
and maritime tracks and units. A track is a single entity reported on a CTP such as an aircraft, 
ship, theater ballistic missile, or emitter location, which is then reported by each component 
up to the Joint Task Force where it is collated and fused to create the theater picture (Figure 
5.2.).

Chapter 7 
AIR MOBILITY DIVISION 
7.1.  General.  The AMD Chief works for the AOC/CC and will ensure the AMD works as an 
effective division of the AOC in operational planning and execution processes. The AMD will 
plan, coordinate, task, and execute air mobility missions in accordance with the JFACC’s guidance 
and intent. In addition, the AMD will: 
7.1.1.  Coordinate with the DIRMOBFOR, the JFC movement requirements and control 
authority (e.g., the Deployment and Distribution Operations Center (DDOC), COMAFFOR A-
4 staff, and the 618 AOC (TACC)). (T-2) 
7.1.2.  The DIRMOBFOR is the COMAFFOR’s designated coordinating authority for air 
mobility operations. The DIRMOBFOR, normally a senior AF air mobility officer familiar 
with the theater AOR, coordinates and integrates the total air mobility effort for the 
COMAFFOR or JFACC. (T-2) 
7.1.3.  The DIRMOBFOR provides mobility guidance to the AOC AMD to execute the air 
mobility mission. For more doctrinal information regarding the DIRMOBFOR, refer to Air 
Force Doctrine Publication (AFDP) 3-36, Air Mobility Operations. (T-2) 
7.1.4.  Maintain maximum (aircraft) on ground management, and integration and deconfliction 
of theater and AMC assigned air mobility assets in support of JFC objectives. Plan and execute 
air mobility support for user requirements identified and validated by the DDOC. (T-2) 
7.1.5.  Participate in air and space planning and execution processes and coordinate with the 
AOC Commander to ensure the ATO/ACO incorporates air mobility missions. (T-2) 
7.1.6.  Coordinate with the CISR to fulfill all mobility intelligence requirements. (T-2) 
7.1.7.  Ensure air mobility missions are visible in Mobility Air Forces C2 systems and reflected 
in the ATO/ACO. (T-2) 
7.1.8.  Integrate planning and execution of combat support AR operating in the AOR/JOA in 
support of JFACC requirements/objectives. (T-2) 
7.1.9.  Provide theater information to support in-transit visibility, total asset visibility and 
global transportation network. (T-2) 
7.1.10.  Integrate non-kinetic operations, electronic warfare, space and cyber in mobility 
operations. (T-2) 
7.1.11.  Consider impacts of IW, space and cyber events or actions on mobility operations. 
(T-2) 
7.1.12.  Establish requirements for protecting key communications supporting mobility 
operations from cyberspace intrusion/attack/denial in coordination with NKT. (T-2) 
7.1.13.  Identify IO and Public Affairs requirements to support the air mobility mission and 
integrate/deconflict IO and Public Affairs with respective specialty teams. (T-2) 
7.1.14.  Shaping Operations  . The AMD will plan, coordinate, task and execute intratheater 
airlift, aeromedical evacuation (AE) and air refueling (AR) missions. The AMD provides for 
integration and support of all air mobility missions. The AMD schedules theater airlift requests 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
95 
in conjunction with the supported CCDR’s airlift priorities through the CCDR’s DDOC, if 
established, and the 618 AOC (TACC), as required. The AMD Chief ensures that the AMD 
works as an effective division of the AOC in the air planning and execution process. The AMD 
will integrate and direct execution of allocated, apportioned, and assigned theater-mobility 
forces operating in the AOR/JOA in support of the JFC requirements/objectives. The AMD 
should plan and direct air mobility missions in high threat environments (e.g., chemical, 
biological, radiological and nuclear) or Integrated Air Defense Systems. (T-2) 
7.1.15.  Beyond Shaping Operations  . In contingencies, air mobility requirements peak 
during the deployment and build-up stage of the operation. As the contingency transitions into 
the sustainment phase, requirements decrease to a near-steady level. Once the redeployment 
stage begins, air mobility requirements will once again peak. The increased use of non-linear 
air mobility assets throughout the competition continuum will also increase the demand for 
airlift and refueling and may require the need for increased AOC AMD readiness. Therefore, 
the AOC AMD will be prepared to quickly transition from normal to contingency surge 
operations at the very outset of a contingency response and be ready to maintain a surge ops 
tempo through the redeployment stage of a contingency. (T-2) 
7.2.  Major AMD Process Inputs.  Inputs include: DDOC/joint theater patient movement/air 
refueling planner, and other validated requirements, timed phased force deployment data, JAOP, 
JFC priorities, Orders (OPORDS, Deployment Orders, OPLAN, etc.), DIRMOBFOR guidance, 
TPFDD, AOD, ACP, AADP, MAAP brief, ACO, ATO, SPINS, ROE/RUF, RFF, UTC list, 
Situation Reports (SITREPS), Airdrop targeting products/intelligence folders, IPB outputs, patient 
movement and other AE support requests, and inputs from US Transportation Command and 618 
AOC (TACC). 
7.3.  Major AMD Processes.  The AMD Chief and all team chiefs will establish effective 
procedures for managing AMD activities within their span of control. These activities include 
establishing and enforcing procedures that ensure all personnel provide complete, accurate, 
properly formatted, and timely inputs to the global air mobility scheduling systems, and developing 
and managing the battle rhythm sufficient to support JAOP, AOD, SPINS and ATO/ACO 
development, Threat Working Group policy recommendations, operational assessment, and 
special projects, as required. (T-2) 
7.4.  Major Process Outputs.  Outputs include: The airlift schedule, tanker schedule, air mobility 
support schedule, DIRMOBFOR briefing, ATO/ACO change requests, SPINS, JPRL, AMD MA, 
AOC OA, aircraft status, theater AE plan, inputs to COP, TPFDD data, request for forces, after-
action reports, lessons learned, airspace control means requests. and SITREPS to inform higher 
headquarters of air mobility activity in the AOR/JOA. 
7.5.  Organization.  The AMD is comprised of four functionally oriented teams led by the AMD 
Chief. The functional teams are the ALCT, ARCT, AECT, and AMCT. Tailor functional team 
composition (e.g., numbers, specialties, and skill levels) to meet unique mission requirements as 
shown below in Figure 7.1.

Chapter 8 
SPECIALTY/SUPPORT FUNCTIONS 
8.1.  General.  The specialty/support functions provide the AOC with diverse capabilities to help 
orchestrate theater air operations power. Agencies external to the AOC organization provide many 
of these capabilities to the AOC. It is crucial to the success of the AOC to integrate these 
capabilities into the air operations planning and execution process to ensure the best use of 
available assets. The AFFOR staff coordinates regularly with the AOC and often provides 
specialized expertise. The following paragraphs list specialty/support functions. 
8.2.  Component Liaisons.  Component liaisons work for their respective component 
commanders and with the JFACC, AFFOR staff and AOC. Each component normally provides 
liaison elements (BCD, SOLE, NALE, MARLE, SPLE) that work within the AOC. These liaison 
elements consist of experienced specialists who provide component planning and tasking expertise 
and coordination capabilities. They help integrate and coordinate their component’s participation 
in JAOP. The AOC may require other liaison augmentation to support mission operations such as 
Coast Guard, space forces, cyberspace forces, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security 
Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, 16 AF, National Reconnaissance Office, National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and Federal Aviation Administration and other organizations in 
various operational and support areas. 
8.2.1.  Battlefield Coordination Detachment  . The Army Service component commander 
provides the BCD as a liaison element to the Service component commander designated as the 
JFACC or to the Air Force Service component if a JFACC is not designated. The BCD is a 
liaison element and supports the integration of Army Forces air and ground maneuver 
operations, with air component operations. Integrate BCD personnel into AOC divisions to 
support planning, operations, air and missile defense, intelligence, airlift/logistics, airspace 
control, and communications. In particular, the BCD coordinates ground force priorities, 
requests, and items of interest. One of the BCD’s most important functions is to coordinate 
boundary line and fire-support coordination line changes and timing. The BCD brings ground 
order of battle (friendly and enemy), situational awareness and expertise into the AOC, and 
will normally brief the ground situation/intelligence update. The BCD may also provide current 
ground situation inputs to AOC teams for incorporation into daily briefings and intelligence 
summaries. When the Commander, Army Forces is the Combined Forces Land Component 
Commander (CFLCC), the BCD may expedite coordination of air component operations and 
fires within the CFLCC operating area. 
8.2.2.  Naval and Amphibious Liaison Element  . The principal responsibility of the NALE is 
to represent Joint Force Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC) interests with the JFACC 
and AOC. The JFMCC should establish a NALE to meet maritime scheme of maneuver and 
coordination requirements. The NALE consists of Navy personnel facilitating integration of 
JFMCC / Network Control Center guidance and intent into JAOP. The NALE coordinates the 
inclusion of JFMCC objectives and maritime requirements in the JFACC AOD, advocates the 
inclusion of JFMCC targets into the joint integrated prioritized target list, and collaborates on 
maritime airspace requirements and development of appropriate airspace coordinating 
measure. The NALE facilitates integration of the Joint Force Maritime Component 
Commander ABP into the ATO, deconflicts all naval air and surface activities in the JFACC’s 
134 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
ATO, and assists air missions planning when necessary. The NALE monitors execution of 
JAOP, ensuring effects on maritime targets, and integration/coordination of organic missions 
in support of maritime operations. The NALE Tomahawk land attack missile representative 
plays an important role in Tomahawk land attack missile coordination, including airspace 
coordinating measures with the AOC. As collaboration tools and network-centric operations 
between the AOC, the MOC, and the CTFs become more enhanced and reliable, the NALE 
activities will become more focused on those activities requiring rapid or uninterruptable 
responses for JFMCC support. When the Commander, Navy Forces is the Combined Forces 
Maritime Component Commander (CFMCC), the NALE may expedite coordination of air 
component operations and fires with the CFMCC operating area. 
8.2.3.  Marine Liaison Element  . The MARLE represents the Commander, Marine Corps 
Forces and his associated Aviation Combat Element Commander. The MARLE support the 
JFACC in integrating Marine Air-Ground Task Force fires, maneuver, and Marine air into the 
theater campaign and supporting JAOP. This team will be well versed in the Marine Air-
Ground Task Force Commander’s guidance, intentions, schemes of maneuver, and direct 
support aviation plan. 
8.2.4.  Space Liaison Element  . CDRUSSPACECOM is the supported commander for space 
operations. The CSpOC provides a COP to the Joint Force Space Component Command 
(JFSCC) to enable broad, shared awareness of critical information requirements, status of 
forces, and full range of militaryactivities arranged in time, space, and purpose. The SPLE is 
the senior space advisor to the JFACC and represents the CFSCC, with broad space expertise, 
theater familiarity, and advice on the planning, executing, and assessing of space operations. 
The SPLE facilitates coordination, integration, and staffing activities on behalf of the CFSCC 
to include providing support for joint space operations to the JFACC. Space Control includes 
defensive and offensive space control. The entire joint force (air, space, land, maritime, 
cyberspace, and special operations forces) conducts space control operations across the 
tactical, operational, and strategic levels of war. Space control operations include protective 
and defensive measures to ensure friendly forces can continuously conduct space operations 
across the entire spectrum of conflict; and operations to deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, or 
destroy adversary space capabilities. 
8.2.4.1.  Defensive Space Control. Active and passive measures taken to protect friendly 
space capabilities from attack, interference, or unintentional hazards. Defensive Space 
Control operations preserve US/friendly ability to exploit space to its advantage. Active 
and passive actions both protect friendly space-related capabilities from enemy attack or 
interference. Friendly space-related capabilities include space systems such as satellites, 
terrestrial systems such as ground stations, and communication links. Defensive Space 
Control is key to enabling continued exploitation of space by the US and its allies by 
protecting, preserving, recovering, and reconstituting friendly space-related capabilities 
before, during, and after an attack by an adversary. 
8.2.4.2.  Offensive Space Control. Offensive operations conducted for space negation. 
Offensive Space Control operations hinder an adversary from exploiting space to their 
advantage. Offensive Space Control operations may target an adversary's space capability 
(space systems, terrestrial systems, links, or third party space capability), using a variety 
of permanent and/or reversible means. As adversaries become more dependent on space 
capabilities, space control operations have the ability to produce effects that directly affect 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
135 
their ability and will to wage war at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. Denying 
adversary space capabilities may hinder their ability to effectively organize, coordinate, 
and orchestrate a military campaign. 
8.2.4.3.  Space control operations support both the space control mission of United States 
Space Command and theater military operations. United States Space Command mission 
includes surveillance of space, protection of US and friendly space systems, prevention of 
an adversary's ability to use space systems for hostile purpose, and negation of adversarial 
capability if necessary. 
8.2.5.  Special Operations Liaison Element (SOLE)  . The Joint Forces Special Operations 
Component Commander, or Commander, Joint Special Operations Task Force provides a 
SOLE to the JFACC to coordinate and integrate special operations force activities in the entire 
operational environment. The SOLE coordinates, integrates, deconflicts, and synchronizes all 
SOF air, surface and subsurface activities by providing a SOF presence in all the AOC 
divisions. The joint SOLE is comprised of representatives from special operations forces 
aviation, intelligence, airspace, logistics, AF Special Tactics Teams, Army Special Forces, 
Navy Sea-Air Land Teams, and Marine Special Operations Forces, as required. Depending 
upon command structure agreements, the SOLE may, or may not represent coalition or allied 
special operations forces. SOLE personnel coordinate, integrate and synchronize with various 
AOC functional areas to ensure that all special operations forces targets, special operations 
forces teams, and special operations forces air tasks and/or missions are deconflicted, properly 
integrated, and coordinated during planning and execution phases. The prevention of fratricide 
is a critical objective of the SOLE’s efforts. 
8.2.5.1.  Specific SOLE functions include but are not limited to: Inputs into JFACC 
strategy development, inputs into ATO and ACO development, real-time mission support 
coordination with the Special Operations Task Group with special emphasis on airspace 
deconfliction, operational and intelligence inputs into the targeting process, and close 
coordination with the Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell/Joint Personnel Recovery 
Center. 
8.2.5.2.  As the Joint Force Special Operations Component Commander / Commander, 
Joint Special Operations Task Force and the JFACC share a common environment 
throughout the entire operational environment, they must integrate special operations 
forces aviation and surface forces into joint air, space, and cyberspace operations planning 
and execution to prevent fratricide, duplication of effort, and conflict. Active SOLE 
participation in the development of air, space, and cyberspace operations strategy and the 
supporting plans to the theater campaign plan ensures that special operations forces efforts 
will, in fact be a force multiplier for the theater campaign plan. 
8.2.5.3.  Special operations forces normally pursue special operations forces-unique 
objectives, which prepare, shape or enhance broader JFC objectives. They may also operate 
in support of conventional objectives or require conventional support of their objectives, 
which requires SOLE coordination with the AOC for joint special operations. 
8.2.5.4.  Additionally, SOLE will provide inputs and guidance to the NKE Team. It acts as 
the focal point for raising JFACC concerns or military information support operations 
objectives/tasking to the JFC for consideration, planning, and execution. SOLE provides 
support to the NKE team’s Mission Information Support Operations (MISO) effort to 
136 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
synchronize and deconflict MISO with air, space, and cyberspace operations (leaflet drops, 
message broadcasts, and aircraft missions are included in the ATO, etc.). 
8.2.6.  Coalition/Allied Liaison Officers  . Liaison officers representing coalition/allied forces 
are integrated into the AOC and improve situational awareness regarding the disposition of 
friendly forces, especially when those forces do not have a mature TACS. They are also 
essential for unity of effort for coalition air and missile defense operations and airspace 
deconfliction. Liaison officers who possess sufficient foreign and English language skills, or 
if teamed with linguists, can also help overcome language barriers with remote allied/coalition 
forces. In force projection scenarios into an immature theater, the AOC/CC should anticipate 
the need for liaison officers and actively seek them out via the JFC staff, in-country military 
group, staff country team, or direct contact with coalition forces. Normally use the request for 
forces process, either in the operational pre-planning or during specific operations, to request 
these liaisons. Request specific expertise to assist in planned or continuing operations. 
8.2.7.  Other Liaisons  . The COMAFFOR/JFACC may require other liaison augmentation to 
support AOC functions, to include: unit-level; United States Coast Guard; DIA; National 
Security Agency; CIA; Drug Enforcement Agency; Citizenship and Immigration Services; 
Customs and Border Patrol; FAA; or other federal agencies or departments and allied personnel 
in various operational and support areas. 
8.3.  Air and Missile Defense Command.  As the senior Army air and missile defense element at 
the AADC’s location, the AAMDC serves as the primary interface at the AOC for all land-based 
active air and missile defense. The AAMDC is normally under the operational control of the 
Commander, Army Forces. When directed by the JFC, AAMDC assets may directly support or be 
under tactical control of the JFACC/AADC as appropriate. The roles of the AAMDC include 
Senior Army Air Defense Artillery lead and theater Army air and missile defense coordination. 
Coordination and liaison functions between all three components and coalition partners are 
essential to effective air and missile defense operations within a given theater. The AAMDC and 
AOC intelligence personnel build a collaborative air and missile defense intelligence preparation 
of the operational environment, which serves as the basis for joint theater air and missile defense 
strategies and plans. The AAMDC (attack operations section in coordination with the intelligence 
section) submits theater missile target nominations directly to the AOC for inclusion as JFACC 
nominated targets. The AAMDC also sends a robust liaison officer team (active defense, 
intelligence, and attack operations personnel) to support the JFACC and AADC requirements and 
may deploy the AAMDC Tactical Operations Center to the JFACC AADC location. 
8.4.  Combat Reports Cell (CRC).  (Any AFSC) (Rank E-3-O-4). The combat reports cell reports 
directly to the CCO for guidance and direction. Given the KM nature of CRC responsibilities, 
CCO may designate the CRC as the COD KM representative and/or assign the CRC directly to the 
AOC KM team to represent COD KM requirements. However, CRC must adhere to the AOC 
KMP regardless of the organization ties to the AOC KM team. The manning of the combat reports 
cell is contingent upon the level of operations. Unless the AOC Commander assigns responsibility 
to knowledge operations personnel elsewhere in the AOC, combat reports personnel are the focal 
point for collection of current operations information provided to the AOC by all elements of the 
TACS and employed forces. Required reports address the operational status of forces, weapons, 
and control system equipment employed by an AOC. Reports cell personnel are responsible for 
collection and consolidation of COD inputs to the JFACC update briefing and the daily situation 
report. Should be knowledgeable on US Message Text Format and understand how to complete 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
137 
additional reports such as Operational Taskings, Operations Reports, nuclear, biological and 
chemical reports, and search and rescue requests. Personnel are required to access and manipulate 
sortie data within the TBMCS database; parse the ATO; coordinate and obtain results of flying 
operations from other agencies within the AOC; establish computer information pipeline 
requirements (Non-secure IP Router Network, Secret IP Router Network, UNCLAS e-mail, 
Coalition networks, TBMCS, etc.); post JFACC briefings to the Secret IP Router Network; and 
perform any other duties assigned by the JFACC. 
8.5.  Airspace Management Team.  (AFSC: 13M/13B/1C1/1C5) (Rank: 0-4 - O-5/E-4 - E-8). 
The airspace management team assists with the procedural deconfliction air space and provides 
the JFACC a single point of contact for airspace matters. The team is responsible for producing 
the ACP. The goal of the AMT is to enhance air, land, maritime and special operations forces 
components’ effectiveness in accomplishing the JFC’s objectives, while decreasing the potential 
for fratricide. Effectively coordinating, integrating and de-conflicting airspace and Coordination 
Measures within the joint/Coalition AOR accomplishes this objective. The AMT is a cross-
functional specialty team with representatives in CPD and COD. 
8.5.1.  Airspace Management Team Inputs  . AOC divisions and cells, the International Civil 
Aviation Organization, FAA, host nation, neighboring nations, Nongovernmental 
Organization, and the United Nations (UN) may all place requirements and/or restrictions on 
use of airspace. Inputs may include ACM requests from all airspace users (e.g., components, 
coalition), host nation restrictions, coalition members, and components, in addition to existing 
airspace restrictions (e.g., civil airways, host nation/component air traffic control, and threats 
to aircraft). 
8.5.2.  Airspace Management Team Outputs  . The ACP may be stand-alone or part of the 
JAOP. ACO and ACO changes, properly formatted IAW US Message Text Format (USMTF) 
requirements. ACM requests to identify conflicts and to assist in the coordination with various 
airspace users. When all conflicts have been resolved or the associated risks accepted, the ACO 
will be generated, validated IAW USMTF standards, and disseminated through appropriate 
USMTF message handling system or available via posting on AOC webpage. 
8.5.3.  Airspace Management Team Chief  . (AFSC: 13M/13B) (Rank: O-3/O-4). 
8.5.3.1.  Directs operations of the AMT supporting all AOC airspace needs especially 
within the CPD and COD. The AMT Chief is responsible for the development/currency of 
the ACP; the development, generation, and dissemination of the ACO; and the 
development, generation and dissemination of all applicable changes to the daily ACO. 
The AMT Chief is normally the senior airfield operations officer in the AOC. 
8.5.3.2.  Acts as the AOC/CC’s focal point for coordinating all airspace matters with 
civilian/coalition/host nation airspace authorities and users. Ensures sufficient trained and 
qualified manning is available to support JFACC mission needs. 
8.5.4.  Airspace Management Team Superintendent  . (AFSC 1C1 or 1C5D) (Rank E-8). The 
AMT superintendent provides oversight and direction to the enlisted members of the AMT and 
reports to the AMT Chief. The AMT superintendent also fulfills the duties of the AMT Chief 
in his or her absence and is normally the senior Air Traffic Control non-commissioned officer 
in the AOC. His specific duties are the same as the AMT Chief. 
138 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
8.5.5.  Airspace Management Technicians  . (AFSC 1C1 or 1C5). (Rank E-4-E-7). The AMTs

8.6.  Non-Kinetic Team (NKT). 
8.6.1.  General. The NKT is a single organization that serves as an administrative grouping of 
non-kinetic subject matter experts. The NKT serves as the JFACC’s theater focal point for 
planning, execution, and assessment of non-kinetic operations. (See AFTTP 3-3.AOC for 
additional information.) These processes primarily apply to geographic AOCs. Global AOCs 
may have different organizations and processes. NKT should coordinate with other NKT for 
support, unity of effort, and situational awareness when necessary. The AOC NKT includes 
strategy, planning, execution, and assessment capabilities in electronic warfare, MISO, 
operations security, military deception, counter propaganda, and engagements. The AOC NKT 
coordinates with AFCYBER and 616 OC for defensive cyberspace operations. AOC NKT 
coordinates with the theater space component for space control and other space effects. In 
addition, the NKT often serves as NKE capabilities, and non-kinetic operations capability 
specialists for the AFFOR staff. 
8.6.1.1.  Non-Kinetic Duty Officer (NKDO). The NKDO is the focal point on the AOC 
floor for all IW and non-kinetic operations and works directly for the CCO in support of 
SADO and SODO. The NKDO coordinates directly with each team across COD and with 
other divisions to synchronize and layer kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. Brief 
SODO/SADO on the non-kinetic synchronization matrix for when non-kinetic assets are 
available to support operations. The NKDO should be experienced in multiple non-kinetic 
disciplines and may fulfill several NKO team functions. For example, an experienced EWO 
assigned as the NKDO may also fill the role of Electronic Warfare Duty Officer (EWDO). 
The NKDO should be familiar with enemy NK threats, NK defenses, threats to cyber and 
space operations, spectrum management requirements, and deconfliction. 
8.6.1.2.  Non-Kinetic Duty Technician (NKDT). The NKDT works directly for the NKDO 
and ensures the various functions of non-kinetic operations are performed. Act as non-
kinetic operations equipment outage POC, coordinates with CFP/help desk for all system 
MX issues related to IW Operations Team equipment (e.g., radios, computers, and 
telephones). Maintain NKDO logbook and ensure end-of-shift compilation of significant 
events from the IW Operations Team logs. 
8.6.1.3.  Electronic Warfare Duty Officer (EWDO): The EWDO coordinates the 
employment of all EW assets in the ATO by working closely with the EWCC duty officer 
during the preparation and execution of EW missions. Although the EWDO is a function 
under the NKDO, the EWDO’s duties may be performed by the same person who acts as 
the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) Duty Officer (SEADDO). In such 
situations, the NKDO should not be tasked with EWDO duties in order to avoid saturating 
the NKDO. 
8.6.1.4.  Interdiction Duty Officer (IDO). Responsible for management of all interdiction 
assets assigned or made available (to include joint/coalition assets). 
8.6.1.5.  Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses Duty Officer (SEADDO). The SEADDO 
coordinates the employment of SEAD assets in the ATO. The SEADDO coordinates 
closely with the EWDO. 
140 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
8.6.1.6.  Closer Air Support Duty Officer (CASDO). Coordinates and monitors the 
employment of CAS missions and with the other ODOs/BCD/Air Support Operations 
Center for non-CAS missions short of the fire support coordination line. 
8.6.2.  NKT normally supports each step of the air tasking cycle by integrating NKT members 
into divisions and teams, including SGT, SPT, OAT, TET, MAAP Team, ACF, ISRD Targets 
Team, and duty positions in the COD. NKT members should attend training based on 
commander determination of principal duty position during contingency operations. For 
example, a crewmember assigned to be a NKDO should attend COD initial qualification 
training. 
8.6.3.  As the team lead, the NKT Chief handles administrative non-kinetic operations issues 
for the team. At a minimum, the NKT Chief will address non-kinetic effects issues, including: 
organization, training, and equipping issues; manning and personnel issues (including annual 
reports); financial issues; and team member work schedules, including whom should attend 
which meetings or working groups. (T-3) 
8.6.4.  At a minimum, there should be one subject matter expert for each of the functions 
described in the following sections. If manning does not allow for separate subject matter 
experts to perform each of the functions listed in the subsequent sections, the NKT Chief will 
identify an individual to be responsible for each function and ensure proper training. Note: 
operations security is a commander’s program and the commander formally appoints the 
OPSEC Program Manager for the command. The AOC operations security point of contact 
may be the Program Manager for the entire Component Major Command/ Component 
Numbered AF or just a coordinator (depending on who the commander appoints. NKT 
members may come from any AFSC, however, 12B/F/R, 14N, 17D/17S, 14F, 1B4, 1NX are 
the most common AFSCs on the team, with 35P supporting synchronization and deconfliction 
with command information and media activities. NKT members should attend applicable 
division training. (T-3) 
8.6.5.  NKT members will lead or participate in various cells and working groups, related to 
their particular specialty. Working groups are enduring or ad hoc organizations within the AOC 
formed around a specific function whose purpose is to provide analysis to users. The working 
group consists of a core functional group and other staff and capability specialists. The cells 
and working groups may include: Information Operations Working Group (IOWG), OPSEC 
Working Group, MISO Working Group, Military Deception (MILDEC) Working Group, 
Electronic Warfare Cell, offensive cyberspace working group, defensive cyberspace working 
group, Combat Information Cell, Threat Working Group, joint working groups and the Special 
Technical Operations working group. (T-3) 
8.6.6.  Depending on mission tasking and available manpower, the AOC Commander may 
modify the organizational structure of the NKT. If the situation arises where other non-kinetic 
and/or IW capabilities require inclusion on the NKT (such as Public Affairs) or existing 
manpower is augmented, the team may be adapted. If, for example, electronic warfare or 
cyberspace missions and manning increase, there may be a need to have a Cyberspace team, 
an Electronic Warfare team or even a combined Cyberspace/Electronic Warfare Cell in 
addition to the NKT. In major combat operations, the COD may need a NKDO team to monitor 
and make dynamic changes during execution. These additional team(s) would normally 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
141 
operate independently of, but should integrate planning and execution efforts with the NKT 
via the IOWG. See AFTTP 3-3.AOC for additional information. 
8.6.7.  Ensure full integration of the NKT with special technical operations planning. 
8.6.8.  The Component Commander’s Communication Strategy is the commander’s process to 
coordinate and synchronize themes, messages, images, and actions to support operational-
level, communication-related objectives and ensure the integrity and consistency of themes 
and messages to the lowest tactical level. This process should coordinate with those above, 
below and adjacent to deliver a mutually supporting communication to the intended audiences. 
At a minimum, the Component Commander’s Communication Strategy is comprised of an 
activity synchronization chart in support of component inform and influence related objectives, 
and consolidated lists of talking points for specific audiences of concern. Although the NKE 
planner (or designated communication synchronization lead) is the overall responsible person 
to develop the Component Commander’s Communication Strategy, all AOC planners will be 
involved in the process. 
8.6.9.  The NKT Chief will serve as the primary focal point coordinating with the AFFOR 
staff, higher headquarters, and other government and military agencies in support of non-
kinetic effects and activities. (T-3) 
8.6.10.  Normally, several individuals will support NK planning. NK Planners will:

8.6.12.  Operations Security (OPSEC)  . OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and 
controlling critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations 
and other activities. This process identifies actions that adversary intelligence systems can 
observe, and determines which specific indications they could collect, analyze, and interpret 
to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries. The OPSEC process also 
selects and executes measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities 
of friendly actions to adversary exploitation. The person(s) responsible for the OPSEC function

8.6.13.  Military Deception (MILDEC)  . MILDEC are those actions executed deliberately to 
mislead adversary military, paramilitary or violent extremist organization decision makers; 
thereby causing the adversary decision maker to take specific actions (or inactions) that will 
contribute to the accomplishment of the friendly mission. MILDEC is applicable at all levels 
of war, throughout the competition continuum, and during all phases of military operations. 
Integrate MILDEC at the earliest possible phase of an operation to ensure its effectiveness. 
Base MILDEC on the specific situation and the supported commander’s objectives for the 
operation or campaign. Do not confuse MILDEC with perfidy. Perfidy is the false claim to 
protections under the law of war to secure a military advantage over the opponent. Acts of 
perfidy invite the confidence of enemy persons to lead them to believe they are entitled to, or 
are obligated to accord, protection under the law of war, with intent to betray that confidence. 
The person(s) responsible for MILDEC will: 
8.6.13.1.  Obtain behavioral influence analysis on specific adversary military decision

sovereignty, taxes, customs, aircraft accidents, and civil reserve air fleet. These issues need to 
be coordinated with the JFACC/JA staff. (T-2) 
8.7.8.  JAs advising specialty teams or AOC personnel in communication roles, such as the 
NKO Team, IO Cell, or Combat Information Cell, will review communications and assist in 
the development of communication courses of action and products. (T-2) 
8.7.9.  Joint JAs will work with other service JAs who may have differing approaches in the 
way they conduct business. Establish early communications with JA peers at respective 
components within the CCMD. Participate in joint exercises with other service JAs and 
consider inviting them to attend AOC exercises either as participants or observers. 
8.7.10.  Coalition JA should establish good working relationships with both allied and coalition 
JAs. Doing so will develop both a mutual understanding of differing legal approaches and 
methodologies and will assist in both cross-coordination of concerns when conducting 
coalition operations, and timely issue resolution. 
8.8.  Weather Specialty Team.  Administratively assigned to the COD, the WST is a horizontally 
crosscutting capability integrated into all five AOC divisions to enable ATO mission planning and 
execution. In general, the AOC WST gathers weather information from strategic global forecast 
centers and tailors/provides this information to the JFACC and AOC operators for situational 
awareness. The composition and size of the WST will be dependent on the size and scope of 
operations. WST members must possess security clearances that provide the ability to support each 
AOC division effectively. The WST provides timely notification of METOC impacts affecting 
launch and recovery bases, active orbits/tracks, routes of flight, and other areas of operations as 
directed by the CCO. The WST will generate tailored weather graphics derived from the assigned 
theater operational weather squadron surface forecast and aviation hazard charts, 14th Weather 
Squadron, and appropriate Naval METOC centers that depict weather impacts across the planning 
and execution cycle for the JOA. The WST will post high frequency/UHF fade effects to 
communications on organic systems so they are available to JFACC staff and the AOC. Solar flare 
events will be passed as they are received. These events need to be passed to the space duty officer 
and the communications officer. Once impacts have been assessed, information should be passed 
to the CCO and any other divisions/teams that may be affected. METOC refers to the whole range 
of atmospheric, oceanographic, and space environment phenomena. (T-3) 
8.8.1.  Weather Specialty Team Chief. (AFSC: 15W) (Rank: O-3/O-4). The WST chief is 
responsible for integrating METOC and METOC effects information into all AOC planning 
and execution processes. Information provided by the WST Chief, in general, consists of daily 
briefings to the AOC and JFACC staff, with updates as required, on significant METOC 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
155 
impacts to strategic and operational-level planning and execution. The WST Chief will define 
requirements for reachback support from the appropriate METOC organization. The team chief 
is the senior operational forecaster, and must have a security clearance that allows effective 
support to any division. (T-3) 
8.8.2.  SRD Support. Immerse the WST in strategic planning from the outset to gain a complete 
understanding of JFACC intentions in meeting JFC objectives and to ensure consideration of 
climatological and current METOC conditions in the forming of strategy. The WST uses 
medium to long-range forecasts and climatological information to identify potential 
environmental impacts to enemy and friendly operations. During development of the joint air 
estimate, JAOP, and branch and sequel plans, the strategy plans team will use meteorological 
information to mitigate impacts to friendly forces while capitalizing on advantages due to 
asymmetric environmental effects on enemy capabilities. The WST will focus the strategy 
guidance team on METOC conditions in the 48-96 hour timeframe that could degrade friendly 
force capabilities to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess potential targets. Thorough 
weather information at this stage of planning can have a greater and more influential impact 
on operations than weather information delivered closer to execution. For this reason, it is 
imperative to integrate one or more members of the WST into long-range planning. The more 
familiar the WST member is with the planners, the mission, and the WSs used to accomplish 
the mission, the more effective will be the exploitation of weather information. (T-3) 
8.8.3.  CPD Support. The WST will provide medium to near term METOC information to the 
MAAP Team and TET teams to support all aspects of mission planning, including target area 
METOC effects information, predictions of METOC impacts on missile effectiveness, and 
METOC impacts to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors. Provide the MAAP 
team METOC-effects decision aids, including electro-optical and space METOC-effects 
guidance, for determination of timing and weapons selection. Properly integrated, METOC 
operations play a key role, especially during development of the MAAP. The WST should 
highlight METOC conditions in the next 48-72 hours that could degrade friendly forces’ ability 
to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess potential targets. These forecasts provide the TET 
and MAAP Team an opportunity to adjust the timing of missions as necessary. In addition, the 
MAAP Team can exploit target METOC information and METOC impacts to sensors, 
weapons, weapons systems, and platforms to modify weapons/sensor configurations and 
system mixes. By optimally pairing weapons systems and platforms to targets based on 
METOC conditions, the MAAP Team can maximize the probability of achieving desired 
effects. The WST should study the METOC effects on enemy weapons systems and provide 
METOC influences on enemy systems so that the MAAP and TET teams understand threats 
to friendly forces. (T-3) 
8.8.4.  COD Support. The WST will support all aspects of mission execution including 
dynamic targeting and Personnel Recovery missions, the BCD, and other emerging targeting 
decisions. 
The 
WST 
will 
maintain 
situational 
awareness 
of 
the 
meteorological/oceanographic/solar conditions; provide timely notification of METOC 
elements affecting launch and recovery bases; active orbits/tracks, route of flight, and other 
operations or areas as directed by the CCO. To increase mission effectiveness, the WST should 
inject relevant, accurate METOC and space environment information as early as possible into 
the daily ATO process, enabling decision-makers to mitigate risks and optimize the pairing of 
capabilities to targets. The WST should also be responsive to the need for real-time or near 
156 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
real-time forecasts in support to dynamic re-attack, time sensitive targets, combat search and 
rescue operations, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance collection activities, and other 
emerging requirements. (T-3) 
8.8.5.  ISRD Support. The WST will provide METOC information and predicted impacts on 
ISR sensors, and other friendly and enemy assets and activities. The WST will collect any 
METOC information/imagery available from hostile areas or other areas where routine 
METOC data is unavailable. To support ISR operations effectively, the WST should have 
access to detailed ISR mission profiles and collaborate with appropriate analysts to identify 
the probable METOC sensitivities of enemy capabilities. The security classification of this 
information may demand that the WST Chief directly support the ISRD. During joint 
intelligence preparation of the operational environment, analysts should leverage METOC 
information to help determine likely enemy courses of action, but more importantly, to 
highlight instances in which enemy capabilities are degraded more than friendly capabilities 
(i.e., asymmetrically), offering friendly force commanders an exploitable advantage. The ISRD 
should employ intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor/system capabilities to 
provide non-traditional collection of METOC information in data-sparse and data-denied 
areas. METOC forces leverage this information to formulate a more accurate depiction of 
current and predicted METOC conditions in the operational environment, enhancing support 
to the joint force. The environmental information obtained from the ISRD should be 
reintegrated into the forecast process of the theater Operational Weather Squadron and weather 
flights/detachments providing mission execution forecasts. (T-3) 
8.8.6.  AMD Support. The WST will provide the AMD with tailored information on any 
METOC impacts to air mobility operations. This should include impacts to theater air mobility 
operations such as transport, air refueling, paradrop, and medical evacuation. In particular, the 
WST delivers strategic and operational-level environmental impacts on areas of departure and 
recovery bases (including alternates), landing and drop zones, and air refueling routes 
throughout the designated AOR/JOA. The WST should keep the AMD staff and 
DIRMOBFOR apprised at all times of significant METOC impacts to mobility operations. The 
WST will coordinate with the 618 AOC/WST for mobility missions controlled by the TACC. 
(T-3) 
8.9.  Logistics Combat Support Team.  The Logistics Combat Support Team is the AOC’s focal 
point for all Combat Support related issues affecting the AOC’s ability to plan and execute combat 
air power. When conducting joint operations, other service or coalition logisticians should supply 
combat support information affecting support and sustainment to the Logistics Combat Support 
Team. During strategy development and other planning processes, the AFFOR staff will provide 
the Logistics Combat Support Team assessments of potential impact to beddown decisions, 
impacts of time phased force and deployment data, and feasibility and forces closure estimates. 
The Logistics Combat Support Team is comprised of officers and non-commissioned officers from 
across the Agile Combat Support community, as the mission/situation requires. The Logistics 
Combat Support Team gives the AOC an on-site team with a broad range of combat support 
expertise as well as a direct line of communication to the combat support expertise on the AFFOR 
staff. The Logistics Combat Support Team is a part of the AFFOR staff and reports directly to the 
AFFOR staff A4. A field-grade combat support officer familiar with AOC processes and the broad 
range of combat support operations that may affect AOC processes and ATO execution leads the 
Logistics Combat Support Team.

8.10.  Knowledge Management Team.  The component headquarters organization will establish 
an effective KM organizational structure and flow strategy throughout the air component. The KM 
team will develop the KMP and design a strategy to meet the entire component headquarters and 
subordinate organizations’ needs for seamless, relevant and timely information, while optimizing 
the use of information infrastructure resources. The AOC KM support team is a sub-element of 
the Component Headquarters KM organization. The goal of KM is to provide relevant, precise, 
accurate, timely, usable, and complete information that supports the commander in obtaining 
situational awareness, and an understanding that allows him to make timely and effective decisions 
faster than the adversary can react. In a non-combat situation, it enables a tempo that allows the 
force to shape the situation or react to changes and accomplish the mission. (T-3) 
8.10.1.  General Information  . General information is a weapon and a target. The intent is to 
treat information as an asset, just like any other weapon or tool of warfare. It controls forces 
and delivers precise effects. Command and control of information supports the commander in 
three main areas: achieving situational awareness/ understanding, making decisions, and 
communicating execution information to implement those decisions. In that context, everyone 
in the AOC is an information manager with an inherent responsibility to acquire, assess, reason, 
question, correlate, and disseminate quality information to other users, and to maintain and 
protect it throughout its life cycle. 
8.10.2.  Supported and Supporting Division/Team Relationships  . The division/team chiefs, 
information and information system users have a shared, corporate responsibility with the KM 
support team for the effectiveness and efficiency of the KM processes supporting AOC 
operations.

Combatant Command KM Team. KM Officer is responsible for coordinating the flow and 
management of information throughout the AOC including control of processes linking 
sensor and discovery information to knowledge management tools used to build and, 
execute operations, assess operational success, and adjust AOC KM activities accordingly. 
The KM Officer works with the AOC director and divisions to ensure information needs 
are met through focused data and KM processes. The AOC KMP should be synchronized 
to the larger component NAF or component-MAJCOM KMP. Provide the KM Officer and 
respective KM Team members with any applicable training offered by both AFFOR and 
Combatant Command KM team. The KM Officer must proactively engage with the 
respective KM community to ensure the KMP is synchronized and implementable. The 
AOC KM Team is normally composed of the KM Officer, KM non-commissioned officer 
in charge, and KM Team members. The AOC/CC, in coordination with AFFOR staff and 
Combatant Command KM leadership, will make the final decision on composition of the 
AOC KM team depending upon each unique circumstance. (T-3)

8.11.  Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell (PRCC).  The PRCC will plan, coordinate, and 
direct the execution of Personnel Recovery missions for the JFACC. The PRCC is a specialty team 
within the AOC, administratively assigned to the COD, but with PRCC personnel integrated into, 
or working closely with other AOC divisions to facilitate the planning, coordination, and execution 
of all AFFOR PR missions and the reintegration of recovered AFFOR personnel. The PRCC may 
vary in size and composition; organized based on mission requirements. Duties involve 
coordinating the five tasks of reporting, locating, supporting, recovering, and reintegrating isolated 
personnel. Isolated personnel are, in effect fleeting targets of critical value—available capabilities 
and assets should be expeditiously coordinated and employed to effect successful recoveries. The 
JFACC, through the AOC and PRCC, exercises tactical control of joint force-assigned, Personnel 
Recovery-capable assets made available for Personnel Recovery tasking. The PRCC is typically 
composed of a chief/deputy chief, duty officers, planners, controllers; survival, evasion, resistance,

of special technical capabilities with conventional operations to meet JFC and JFACC objectives 
as defined in the JAOP. The STO works for the AOC/CC and supports all divisions within the 
AOC. The STO planning process mirrors the conventional planning process, and the capabilities 
presented through the STO process should be treated no differently than any other capability 
except for their special security requirements. The STO team does not "own" any AOC process 
but supports all processes across the AOC. Consequently, the team relies on collaboration with 
STO briefed individuals in the AOC divisions and teams to develop the separate but necessary 
classified concepts, briefings, legal reviews and documents for strategy, guidance, targeting, 
apportionment, plans, and operations. (T-3) 
8.12.1.  The STO team will: 
8.12.1.1.  Facilitate the development of STO and operationally sensitive military 
capabilities supplements to the JAOP, AOD, MAAP, etc. The STO team will facilitate 
coordination for planners and other specialty teams/special mission units to provide 
additional assistance to the planner. For example: As the AOD and AOD supplement are 
developed by the SRD, the STO team makes available resources and facilities to the 
strategy representatives in obtaining the information necessary to complete the AOD 
supplement and preparation of the AOD decision brief. (T-3) 
8.12.1.2.  Ensure adequate facilities are available to facilitate compartmented planning and 
briefings. These facilities will have proper accreditations, compartmented approvals, and

and provides those STO assessments back to AOC STO planners. 
8.12.2.3.  STO Duty Officers (AFSCs 11, 12, 13, 17) (Rank: O-3/O-4). The STO Duty 
Officers will monitor, coordinate, and direct STO efforts during ATO execution. STO Duty 
Officers monitor STO-related missions on the ATO, issue execute/terminate instructions, 
and participate in the dynamic targeting/time sensitive targeting process, to ensure 
retargeting of STO targets as appropriate. STO Duty Officers feed results of STO execution 
back to STO planners for consideration in devising follow-on plans and to SRD operational 
assessment personnel to help them evaluate effectiveness and efficiency of air, space, and 
cyberspace operations in achieving JFC and JFACC objectives. (T-3) 
8.12.2.4.  STO KM Manager: (AFSC 1D7X) (Rank E-5/E-6). The STO KM Manager

billet management actions. 
8.12.2.6.  STO Planners (Varies). STO planners provide inputs to the divisions that affect 
or support division products/processes. 
8.13.  Regional Air Movement Control Center.  A RAMCC may be established in an area when 
significant military forces operate in an area with an inadequate air traffic control infrastructure. 
The RAMCC is considered a Coordination vs a Control Center per doctrinal reference. This 
specialty team, which is not necessarily collocated with the AOC, reports directly to the AOC 
Director and provides a way for the AADC to have visibility over non-military air traffic not 
depicted on the ATO. The RAMCC serves two specific functions with regard to assisting the 
JFACC in the role of ACA. The first function of the RAMCC is to provide airspace control when 
there is an inadequate Air Traffic Control infrastructure. In this capacity, the RAMCC uses 
procedural measures to deconflict air traffic transiting the AOR/JOA. The second function of the 
RAMCC is to provide contingency airflow management, of civilian and military air traffic, at 
designated airfields within the AOR/JOA. This ensures interagency coordination during planning 
and execution to prevent exceeding airfield capabilities with respect to parking and support. The 
DIRMOBFOR may be strongest advocate to the COMAFFOR/JFACC when establishing a 
RAMCC.

and management of the common C2ISR integrated pictures. The CJE works for the AOC director 
and receives inputs from intelligence, operations, and communications teams to ensure the 
JFACC’s CTP architecture is established properly. CJEs should be experienced 13B or 17D 
officers (O-4 to O-5) with COP-CTP planning and operational experience and be formally trained 
in JDNO operations. CJEs will require a strong working relationship with the JICO and the 
ACOMS/CC (SYSAD, networks, etc.) for terrestrial-IP quality of service, IP and port assignments, 
firewall management, and other functions to ensure robust and uninterrupted AN-to-Link 16 
operations. This position is also responsible to coordinate with the other CJEs to deconflict 
parameters (as detailed in the OPTASKLINK CNR segment) to employ NEW sorties (i.e., unit 
reference number, CNR modem IP address, crypto setting, call signs, primary/secondary control 
and voice frequencies). At the air component level, the CJE’s responsibilities include: Develop the 
OPTASK CNR. Execute the JTF JDNO-produced operations tasking COP (OPTASK COP). 
Implementation command and control doctrine across the integrated AOC picture. Set up and 
manage the AOC GCCS architecture. Provide CTP SME support to AOC personnel. Ensure all 
CTP feeds correlate together to provide an accurate display of the battlespace. Ensure that CTP 
data is distributed to subordinate TACS elements equipped with the appropriate GCCS client 
software. Monitor and resolve connectivity and interoperability issues. 
8.16.1.  Common Tactical Picture (CTP) Manager. The CTP manager is responsible for 
correlating, associating, fusing multi-source CTP track data, and maintaining the CTP support 
architecture. The CTP is the component portion of the COP, and is focused on the current, 
projected, and planned disposition of hostile, neutral, and planned disposition of hostile, 
neutral, and friendly forces (air, ground, maritime, and Intelligence). The CTP Manager works 
for the CJE and receives inputs from the intelligence, operations, and communications teams 
to ensure the CTP clearly represents the near-real-time situation in the AOR. The CTP Manager 
should be an experienced 1C5 with COP-CTP planning and operational experience, and be 
formally trained in JDNO operations. CTP Manager will collect, index, and disseminate CTP 
track data and other related information throughout the AOC, work with the KM team on 
alternative dissemination methods and ensure dissemination is IAW respective KM plan, 
resolve naming conflicts using the processes of correlation (matching tracks plotted on the 
tactical display with the contacts they represent) and fusion (integrating correlated track data 
with amplifying information). Resolve CTP track conflicts and anomalies (i.e., dual 
designations, duplicate tracks, false targets, runaway tracks, and identification and category 
conflicts). Manually correlate tracks to resolve data conflicts in the CTP. Automate multi-
source integration techniques when available. Create, edit, delete, merge, and monitor tracks, 
overlays, and routes. Coordinate with CJE, JICO, and ISRD to ensure compliance with 
OPTASK COP parameters, MX of intelligence feeds, correlation of the ATO, and other

AIR COMMUNICATIONS SQUADRON (ACOMS) 
9.1.  General.  The ACOMS provides critical communications and cyberspace support to the 
AOC, ensuring continuous security, operational availability, and reliability of resources (systems 
and people) in support of the AOC mission. The ACOMS integrates AOC systems with other 
USAF, DOD, joint, and coalition systems. Its goal is to deliver reliable secure communication and 
cyber capabilities to the AOC/CC and the AOC staff, enabling air, space and cyberspace operations 
throughout the tactical or JOA. The ACOMS/CC coordinates directly with the AOC/CC. The 
ACOMS works on a regular basis with the unit’s AOC Configuration Manager, ISSO, and WSM 
to configure AOC networks, keep them on-line for AOC users, and control them in accordance 
with guidance provided by the AOC/CC, AOC WS Configuration Review Board, and site AOC 
Configuration Review Board. 
9.1.1.  The ACOMS is typically composed of five functions: CFP, Network Operations, C2 
Systems, Data Links and Radio Frequency Transmissions, and Plans and Programs. 
Collectively, the functions provide AOC-unique communications services and tools for 
planning, generating, employing, and directing air, and IO forces. The ACOMS will coordinate 
with space and cyber components on space and cyberspace planning and operations. Some 
communications and cyberspace personnel may be embedded in core AOC divisions and 
specialty or support teams, and they may or may not operate as extensions of and in 
coordination with the ACOMS (i.e., they may work for the chief of their assigned division or 
team and not for the ACOMS). Operations, reporting instructions, and responsibilities for 
communications support will follow guidance in Methods and Procedures Technical Order, 
00-33A-1001, General Cyberspace Support Activities Management Procedures and Practice 
Requirements, applicable joint and AF directives, operation plans or orders, and local 
supplements. If any guidance conflict occurs, joint publications take precedence; personnel 
will follow the joint publication pending guidance or clarification from proper authorities. 
(T-2) 
9.1.2.  The ACOMS receives information exchange requirements or communications system 
(CS) requirements from AOC divisions and teams; the ACOMS collaborates with the WSM, 
Configuration Manager, site ISSO, and other AOC personnel as required to staff and process 
AOC Configuration Review Board-approved requirements. The C2 Plans Team often consults 
AOC communications personnel, who may support C2 communications planning and COD 
during execution of those plans. The ACOMS’ roles and responsibilities for cyberspace 
security (formerly known as Information Assurance) are key to ensuring efficient flow of 
information into, through and out of the AOC, while providing the confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of the information and their systems. 
9.2.  Major ACOMS Process Inputs.  Communications support requirements include, but are not 
limited to: IER, higher headquarters direction, Enterprise Change Notices, spectrum/frequencies, 
internal and external data networks (Non-secure IP Router Network, Secret IP Router Network, 
etc.), email and message services, cryptographic support, data link networks, line of sight and 
beyond line of sight voice, video teleconference, Multilevel Secure Voice, computer hardware, 
and special circuits (e.g., Intel distribution networks), Annex K, joint communications-electronics 
operating instructions, AOC floor plan, KMP, Operational requirements, joint restricted frequency 
166 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
list, ACOMS/CC, AFFOR A6, and JFC J6 guidance. Communications system and service 
requirements will be coordinated and managed via local change management process with inputs 
from the site’s ACOMS, WSM, ISSO, and Configuration Manager. 
9.3.  Major ACOMS Processes.  The major communications support processes are 
communications integration, system administration, planning, cyberspace security, network 
operations, configuration management, spectrum management, system monitoring and outage 
reporting, system MX, requirements management, project management, and client systems 
support. The team works with the MAJCOM/Air Force Forces Communication Control Center, 16 
AF (AFCYBER), 616 OC, the assigned Cyberspace Liaison/Support Element, host base 
communications squadron, and the AOC WS Help Desk, as required. Note: In some cases, the 
host base may provide some services, such as long-haul communications connectivity, telephone, 
network services, internal and external data networks (NIPR, SIPR, JWICs) power, heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning, etc. In those instances, the support should be documented in 
appropriate agreements (memoranda of agreement, service-level agreements, etc.). 
9.4.  Major ACOMS Process Outputs.  Major ACOMS process outputs are communications 
planning and communications plans; communications systems (phones, computers, switches, 
routers, etc.); communications system planning, CFP input to the DAL, configuration management 
and MX; network architecture planning, configuration, operations and management; cyberspace 
security; cryptographic management; information exchange requirements and CS requirements 
management; project management; help desk support; and systems technical expertise. 
9.5.  Organization.  The ACOMS/CC routinely coordinates directly with AOC/CC. The ACOMS 
is typically organized into six functional areas (see Figure 9.1., Typical ACOMS Organization 
and Functions).

function will support the ACOMS/Support Squadron quality assurance efforts. If tasked, 
Plans and Programs will manage the ACOMS/Support Squadron quality assurance 
program. T.O. 00-33A-1001 outlines quality assurance roles and responsibilities. (T-3) 
9.6.6.6.  Update and maintain rack elevation drawings, floor plans, and hardware 
inventories. (T-3) 
9.6.7.  Cyberspace Defense Function  . The Cyberspace Defense function provides an in-
depth cyberspace defense of the AOC, but also presents the AOC Commander and CFACC 
with the information necessary to make informed decisions about operations, based on known 
cyber threats, cyber anomalies, and ongoing cyber incidents. Manning the teams is not assured. 
Cyberspace Defense functions were removed from the AOCs due to lack of funding and the 
creations of Prime MDTs. Outside of those AOCs selected to have Prime MDTs, 
ACOMS/AOCs have no manpower or funding for continuing Cyberspace defense functions 
and AOC CCs may be forced to support the functions out of existing AOC manpower and/or 
reporting mission shortfalls in SORTS. The Cyberspace Defense function should be comprised 
of the Flight Commander, AOC Cyber Mission Assurance and Cyber Defense Technicians 
with various specialty shreds as deemed appropriate by the ACOMS/CC. Although the 
Network Operations Function in the AOC already performs some network and cyberspace 
defense tasks for the AOC, the Cyberspace Defense function will focus in on the Key Terrain 
– Cyber (KT-C) and may be trained and equipped to perform a more in-depth defense of this 
terrain. The Cyberspace Defense function should have a solid understanding of how certain 
risks to the KT-C could affect the AOC IT/cyber based capabilities and possibly influence the 
mission. This is a key point as successful cyber mission assurance is focused on the mission 
first and defense of the KT-C second. Decisions under the respond and recover functions for 
an AOC will primarily be driven by the tempo/timing of operations and the associated risk to 
those operations whereas cyber defense of networks not tied to a WS would normally focus on 
neutralizing and potentially clearing a threat as quickly as possible. The tasks associated with 
cyber mission assurance fall within the Air Force Cybersecurity Framework as laid out in AFI-
17-130 Cybersecurity Program Management, 13 Feb 20, and therefore, the responsibilities 
174 
AFMAN13-1AOCV3  25 JUNE 2024 
listed below are organized according to the five core functions of this framework. The AOC 
Cyberspace defense function will: 
9.6.7.1.  Identify Activities: 
9.6.7.1.1.  Perform Functional Mission Analysis of the AOC to identify KT-C and 
associated mission dependencies. (T-3) 
9.6.7.1.2.  Periodically review KT-C for changes and assess them for any 
recommended changes to the AOC cyber defense posture. (T-3) 
9.6.7.1.3.  Develop local AOC and component level notification and reporting 
procedures for anomalous activity and possible cyber incidents. These procedures 
should not contradict AFI17-203, Cyber Incident Handling. (T-3) 
9.6.7.2.  Protect Activities: 
9.6.7.2.1.  Advise the AOC/CC on policies and plans to better posture the AOC for 
cyberspace defense. (T-3) 
9.6.7.2.2.  Advise the site ISSO on AOC firewall vulnerabilities. (T-3) 
9.6.7.2.3.  Coordinate with AOC/CC, WSM, site ISSO, PMO and other entities as 
needed to develop Pre-Approved Actions and Pre-Coordinated Actions. (T-3) 
9.6.7.3.  Detect Activities: 
9.6.7.3.1.  Monitor AOC KT-C and MX actions. Keep and monitor logs for all KT-C 
relevant systems. (T-3) 
9.6.7.3.2.  Report all anomalies and possible incidents in accordance with AFI 17-203. 
(T-3) 
9.6.7.3.3.  Execute local notification and reporting procedures when anomalous 
activity and possible incidents are detected. (T-3) 
9.6.7.3.4.  Be prepared to satisfy requests for additional data, information or files from 
616 OC. (T-3) 
9.6.7.4.  Respond Activities: 
9.6.7.4.1.  Support AOC/CC OPREP and SITREP reporting. (T-3) 
9.6.7.4.2.  Participate in Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) if one is stood up to 
address a reported anomaly or incident. (T-3) 
9.6.7.4.3.  Provide the AOC/CC with possible courses of action from a mission 
assurance perspective, based on the effect on AOC capabilities and risk to mission. 
This will happen in conjunction with the CIRT if one has been stood up. (T-3) 
9.6.7.5.  Recover Activities: 
9.6.7.5.1.  In coordination with CIRT, restore systems to baseline as risk to mission 
permits. (T-3) 
9.6.7.5.2.  Document actions taken, observations, and lessons learned for distribution 
to the AOC enterprise and CIRT members. (T-3)

Chapter 10 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 
10.1.  General.  This chapter informs AOC units, and associated units below MAJCOM level, 
how to publish a supplement to this publication. Differences identified in an AOC supplement 
should only apply to that AOC and any aligned or associated ARC AOC unit. Publish in 
accordance with DAFMAN 90-161. Units will follow instructions on page 1 of this volume for 
approval/distribution of the MAJCOM Supplement. (T-2) 
10.1.1.  Procedures in the supplement shall not be less restrictive than specified elsewhere in 
this AFMAN. This chapter’s intent is for all units to highlight their specific differences in 
operation procedures or organization dictated by their local AOR/JOA, CCDR guidance or 
functional command. Most geographic AOCs and the 608 AOC have an organization structure 
aligned with this basic manual. Global AOCs should provide their organization structure and 
processes not included in this AFMAN. 
10.1.2.  The supplement will contain a statement in the opening paragraph advising the reader 
that it further implements and is incomplete without AFMAN 13-1AOC, Volume 3. (T-2) The 
supplement is not a single source document for procedures contained in other official 
publications, directives, or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided in 
other official publications; however, reference to those publications is acceptable when it 
serves to facilitate location of information necessary for local operating procedures. 
10.2.  Organization.  The supplement should be organized in the following format and, as a 
minimum, include the following: Note: Due to the diversity of AOC missions, units are authorized 
to organize their supplement which will best suit their mission. 
10.2.1.  Introduction. 
10.2.2.  General Policy. 
10.2.3.  Unit Mission. 
10.2.4.  Unit Peacetime Organization. 
10.2.5.  Command and Control. 
10.2.6.  Unit Standards (Optional). 
10.2.7.  OPSEC/ Communications Security procedures. 
10.2.8.  Associated Unit Organization and Support Mission.
