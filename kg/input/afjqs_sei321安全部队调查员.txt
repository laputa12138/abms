1. PURPOSE. As directed by DAFI 31-103, Law Enforcement Programs, and Army Technique 
Publication 3-39.12, Law Enforcement Investigations, this AFJQS identifies the minimum training 
requirements to become a certified Military Criminal Investigator and be awarded Special 
Experience Identifier (SEI) 321. This AFJQS must be utilized by all investigators assigned to a 
Security Forces Squadron or Unit Type Code and shall serve as a roadmap to develop the Law 
Enforcement Master Training Plan (MTP) and Individual Training Plan (ITP). The process for 
obtaining the Security Forces Criminal Investigator SEI 321 will be completed after obtaining the 
certified Law Enforcement Officer SEI L3/3LE in accordance with DoDI 5525.15, Law 
Enforcement (LE) Standards and Training in the DoD and DoD Peace Officer Standards and 
Training (POST) Commission Guideline #1 and viewed as an advanced certified law enforcement 
skillset. This AFJQS applies to military and civilian Airmen and Guardians assigned to perform 
duties as Security Forces Criminal Investigators and Detectives and will remain in effect until 
superseded or rescinded. 
 
2. TASK QUALIFICATION. Personnel will be certified to the GO/NO GO standard on this 
AFJQS. GO means the individual can perform the task without assistance utilizing appropriate 
instructions or other procedural guidance. Completion of training tasks listed in Part II of this 
AFJQS will be provided through a combination of on-the-job home station training, in-residence 
attendance at the Veterans Affairs Law Enforcement Training Center (VA LETC) Security Forces 
Criminal Investigator Course (Little Rock, AR), U. S. Army Military Police Investigator (MPI) 
Course, (Ft. Leonard Wood, MO), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) Basic 
Special Investigator Course (BSIC) (Glynco, GA), distance learning (DL), web-based courses, or 
course material accepted through the established waiver process.  A task qualified 
supervisor/trainer/certifier from the respective functional area must document training and 
certification for a person to be considered trained and certified on a task. 
 
3. TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION. 
Document training required by this AFJQS in accordance with DAFI 36-2689, Training Program 
and any automated learning management system (LMS) procedural guides.  Military and civilian 
personnel will both utilize the Air Force approved LMS unless it is unavailable.  In those instances, 
military and civilian personnel will utilize a paper copy record of this AFJQS and retain it in their 
On-the-Job training record for military and in the Supervisor’s Employee Brief for civilian 
personnel.  Per DAFI 36-2689, critical tasks associated with this AFJQS are noted by an asterisk 
(*) in this AFJQS and require third party certification (meaning the trainer and certifier must be 
separate individuals).  For third party tasks, if a member with the 321 SEI is not available, the 
NCOIC of Training, Operations Officer, or Superintendent may perform task certification based 
on the ability of the SEI 321 applicant’s ability to demonstrate a “GO” on the task being performed.  
If a military or civilian trainee is assigned an additional duty or task not included in an individual’s 
Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) or this AFJQS, the supervisor will add the 
task(s) to the MTP and ITP.  
 
4. ADDITIONAL DUTY or TASK.  If an Investigator is assigned an additional duty or task not 
listed in this AFJQS, the supervisor will develop an AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard 
Continuation/Command JQS.  The supervisor, trainer, or Program Manager will then develop a 
plan for the member to receive training and certification to become duty position qualified.  
 
5. AWARD OF SEI 321:  In order to attain the 321 SEI, Airman, Guardians, and 0083 personnel 
who attended a FLETA accredited initial skills training venue prior to 1 May 2020 must have 
completed the online 40-hour DoD POST Refresher Course or a 400-hour DoD POST course and 
be signed off on LE AFJQS DODI 5525.15, Guideline 1 tasks prior being scheduled for attendance 
to and AF/A4SO approved investigator academy and awarded the SEI 321.  Unit Training 
Managers shall present the members completed LE AFJQS to the AFIMSC MRT Cell prior to 
receiving a Training Line Number (TLN) for an AF/A4SO approved investigator academy 
quota.  Those who attended a FLETA accredited initial skills training after 1 May 2020 are 
required to attend a 400-hour DoD POST accredited academy and shall present the members 
completed LE AFJQS to the AFIMSC MRT Cell prior to receiving a Training Line Number (TLN) 
for an AF/A4SO approved investigator academy quota and prior to being awarded the SEI 321. 
Air National Guard (ANG) members will submit LE AFJQS to NGB/A4SO prior to being the 
award the SEI and follow ANG formal school process to receive TLN. 
 
NOTE: The SEI awarding criteria established within this AFJQS supersede requirements 
established in the 17 March 2023 3P0X1AB CFETP.  This new SEI 321 award criteria becomes 
effective the date this AFJQS is published, and all personnel awarded the SEI 321 prior to this 
publication are authorized to retain SEI 321 IAW previous requirements. 
 
6. RECERTIFYING.  For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, 
supervisors/trainers/certifiers will employ the evaluate-train-evaluate process to recertify 
personnel on tasks.  Recertification is not required unless there is a break in the AFJQS task for 
more than 366 consecutive calendar days. This does not negate the requirement for military and 
civilian members to undergo annual or otherwise required duty position evaluations, ensuring 
members are proficient on AFJQS tasks. 
 
7. This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable CFMs and MFMs.  The POC for this 
AFJQS is AFSFC/S3T all.afsfc.sfxt@us.af.mil.
