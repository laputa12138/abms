This volume provides deployment information to allow civil engineers and logistics planners to plan for,
design, establish and sustain expeditionary airbases. When used in conjunction with Volume 5 of this
pamphlet series, theater and wing  planners, advance echelon (ADVON) team members and deploying
expeditionary engineers will have the basic tools re quired to identify and employ consistent standards
across the service components for infrastructure development, security and sustainment support for expe-
ditionary bases. This volume is not intended to provide a definitive design or layout applicable for every
type of deployment. It is intended to provide the planning criteria and background necessary to: (1) Deter-
mine what facilities are required to support Air Force, Joint and Coalition deployments supporting Aero-
space Expeditionary Force (AEF) mi ssions; (2) Identify forces, equipment and resources required to
provide adequate support facilities; (3) Understand the factors that affect transition between initial and
temporary standards; (4) Sustain facility operations through redeployment and reconstitution. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in accor dance with the Air Force Records

1.2.  Purpose. This volume was developed to  provide deployment information, which will allow engi-
neers and logistic planners to pl an for, design, establish and sustain Aerospace Expeditionary Force air-
bases. When used in conjunction with Volume 5 of this series, theater and wing planners, advance echelon
(ADVON) team members and deploying units’ expeditionary engineers will have the basic tools required
to identify and employ consistent standards and expectations across the service components for infra-
structure development, security and sustainment support for expeditionary bases. This volume is not
intended to provide a definitive de sign or layout applicable for every type of deployment. Rather, it is
intended to provide the planning criteria and background necessary to: 
1.2.1.  Determine what facilities are required to support Air Force and joint service deployments con-
ducted for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces operations. 
1.2.2.  Identify what forces, equipment and resources are required to provide adequate support facili-
ties. 
1.2.3.  Understand the factors that affect transition between initial and temporary standards. 
1.2.4.  Sustain facility operations within conditions that require a range from austere to initial to tem-
porary standard.

AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
1.3.  Scope. The materials in this volume are most helpful when used as an update to bare base planning.
It updates bare base planning criteria to consider  various Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF) deploy-
ment strategies used to support theater of operations (TO) locations. It provides: planning, design, layout
and construction considerations based on force deployment; additional information on deployment time-
lines; expected facility requirements along the timeline; information on  tailoring of forces and support
packages; and lessons learned based approaches to sustaining facilities and utilities. 
1.4.  Background. Prior to 1989, the Air For ce was postured against one primary threat, the Soviet
Union. Much of our force was fo rward deployed and if called to fight, would do so from home base or
would deploy to a well-established, permanently manned facility. While our mobility forces deployed in
support of humanitarian operations, our combat forces generally did no t deploy away from well-estab-
lished bases. 
Figure 1.2.  1980s Cold War Overseas Basing. 
1.4.1.  As permanent forward ba sing was lost, more rapidly deployable, U.S.-based forces were
required to assume greater responsibilities to support operations. The ability to project power quickly
across the globe was becoming mo re of a requirement. In the 1990s , while the number of Air Force
wings and personnel were being reduced, the requi rements for support of operations abroad were
increasing. 
1.4.2.  Since the Gulf War, deployment of both combat and support forces has increasingly been to
more austere forward locations – this has become a way of life for the Air Force. The Air Force stood
up numerous expeditionary bases in much the same way that the Navy and Marines approached expe-
ditionary basing. This approach to deployments led to the Air Fo rce reorganizing under the Expedi-
tionary Aerospace Force construct in January 2000. To support the EAF construct, Aerospace
Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) are formed that operationally link ge ographically separated units into
ten AEFs, each with a designated lead wing. There are also five mobility lead wings designated to pro-
vide global mobility and a constant flow of vital supplies, equipment and other resources from the
United States and allied nations into a theater of operations.

1.4.3.  This publication provides guidance for planning and developm ent of expeditionary airfields
that support associated missions in accordance with Joint Publication 4-04, Joint Doctrine for Civil
Engineering Support. This publication also addresses expeditionary airfield development planning for
the orderly and efficient management, development of land, facilities and infrastructure. The goal is to
take the intent and guidance of Air Force and joint infrastructure and installation regulations and apply
10
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
them to expeditionary operations. This publication is not intended to address all aspects of expedition-
ary airfield planning. For instance, the combatant commander specifies the construction standards for
expeditionary facilities under his responsibility. These standards are established to ensure that projects
support the commander’s intent and concept of operations. 
Figure 1.5.  Air Force 2005 World Wide Deployed Presence. 
1.5.  Base and Construction Standard Terminology and Definitions. Within expeditionary and
long-term operations, there are four types of base camps: forward op erating locations (FOL), forward
operating base (FOB), main operating base (MOB) and intermediate staging base (ISB). 
Figure 1.6.  Main Operating Bases in Southwest Asia. 
1.6.  Planning for Initial Standard Expeditionary Airbases. Today’s EAF mobility concept of "light,
lean and lethal" requires rapid deployment. An AEF wing, group, squadron or unit may deploy to an aus-
tere bare base location that has a runway, taxiways, parking ramp and a source of water that can be made
potable. The deployment has often been accomplished with smaller, tailored Unit Type Code (UTC) pack-
ages and with a mix of aircraft. An austere forward airbase's runway, taxiways and parking ramp may not
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
11
be adequate to meet the requirement for all planned deployed forces; additional engineering forces, such
as the Air Force’s Rapid Engineer Deployable H eavy Operations Response Squadron Engineers (RED
HORSE), or the Navy’s Construction Battalions (CBs or Seabees) or Army Combat Heavy Engineers,
may be required to provide repairs, upgrading and/or expansion to allow full, planned mission use. The
location may also have limited vertical facilities and utilities that can be used, but may have to be repaired
prior to occupancy for its final intended purpose. Ma ny locations may have to re ly on air mobility f or
most or all support. Besides having to use tailored UTC packages for aircraft and personnel, support pack-
ages may have to be further tailored to make them lighter. Some support operations may have to initially
exist as austere, while waiting for resource and logistics capability to robust facilities. Engineers at austere
locations need to plan for increased reliance on expedient expeditionary construction techniques to ensure
mission accomplishments while waiting for upgrades. Developmental delays are usually related to
early-on, airlift-only logistics support for the forward location being dedicated to joint operational support
of other services, such as Army and Marine units and special operations forces. Expedient facilities may
be the fill-in method for operating in initial austere locations. Guidance on expedient engineering methods
can be found in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 7, Expedient Construction Methods.

Chapter 2   
AIR EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BARE BASE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
2.1.  Overview. During the last decade of the Twentieth Century, the US military witnessed many transi-
tions: an end to th e Cold War, semi-permanent overseas basing with stateside reinforcement; Operation
DESERT SHIELD prepositioning along with mass transportation and large scale deployment; low inten-
sity conflicts ruled by geopolitical diplomacy and limited military forces; joint and coalition peacekeep-
ing forces; deployments for military actions other than war; and EAF operations to support rapid, global
deployment. Operation DESERT SHIELD is considered a classic case for lar ge-scale joint deployment
and Global Reach-Global Power force projection to bare bases. Still, DESERT STORM demonstrated that
there were many expeditionary combat support issues  to be resolved to im prove global deployments.
Rapid and continually evolving operational a nd beddown requirements during Operation ENDURING
FREEDOM (OEF) and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) drove the Air Force to the Air Expeditionary
Task Force (AETF) force module concept of operations. This concept provides clearer planning guidance
for opening and establishing airbases in an expeditionary environment. Engineering planners must con-
sider GMTF CONOPS, mission requirements, climate,  host nation capabilities, anticipated operational
duration and airfield and facilities conditions during all phases of the five force modules. 
Figure 2.1.  Tent City during Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. 
2.2.  AETF Force Modules. Force modules provide the framework to  systematically present capability
to rapidly open an airfield, establish operational capability and conduct air operations thereafter. A force
module is defined as a grouping of combat and expeditionary combat support UTCs with accompanied
supplies and required non-unit resuppl y and personnel necessary to sust ain forces for a minimum of 30
days. Elements of force modules ar e linked together or are uniquely identified so that they may be
extracted from or adjusted as an entity in the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES)
databases to enhance flexibility and usefulness of the operations planning and execution process. Force
modules provide planners a simple methodology for matching specific personnel and equipment for spe-
cific mission requirements. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006

2.3.  Force Modules. Force modules help standardize the planning and execution of how forces are
employed and ensure a repeat able and effective process. The five force modules are open the airbase,
command and control, establish the airbase, generate the mission and operate the airbase. Figure 2.2.
provides a graphic representation of force module deployment. 
Figure 2.2.  AETF Force Module Phased Deployment. 
2.3.1.  Open the Airbase. This force module will normally arrive first and assess the airbase for estab-
lishment of airfield operating parameters, command and control and supporting host-nation support
capabilities. It contains a small force (150 personnel) to provide the capability for: command and con-
trol, force protection, cargo and passenger handling, logistics, communications, airfield operations
and establishing minimum operating strip, force accountability and reception and beddown of fol-
low-on modules. The capabilities in the module should rapidly establish an initial operating capability
(IOC) in approximately 36 hours from arrival of forces. 
2.3.1.1.  This module contains capabilities to open an airbase regardless of the follow-on mission
support requirements for a specific mission, airframe or weapons system. 
2.3.1.2.  Open the airbase forces will also provide the capability to plan the layout for follow-on
airbase infrastructure. These forces may be supporting other service components or coalition
allies. Operations may be flying or non-flying, combat or non-combat or any combination thereof.
This module will most likely deploy in the C minus timeframe. Some portions of this module may
depart when the airfield is minimally capable of supporting the follow-on forces. As the forces
assigned to this module are completing their mission, forces from establish the airbase module are
assuming their responsibilities in addition to extending the airfield’s existing capabilities. 
2.3.2.  Command and Control (C2). The C2 module contains the capabilities to establish an air expe-
ditionary wing command and control structure and is estimated to be at IOC in approximately 16
hours after arrival of forces. This module assumes command of the airbase from the initial elements of
the open the airbase module and establishes permanent secure and non-secure communications capa-
bilities. 
2.3.2.1.  This module contains the capabilities to establish initial maintenance group, mission sup-
port group, operations group and medical group staffs. This initial capability will be rounded out
once the establish the airbase and operate the airbase modules arrive. Secure communications
and intelligence are key capabilities to establishing control. 
2.3.2.2.  This module begins at some point on or after C-0 and must be in place prior to any com-
mand elements leaving from the open the airbase force module. 
14
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
2.3.3.  Establish the Airbase. This module contains the capabilities to support most missions or
weapon systems. Together with the open and generate modules, it provides the airfield’s earliest capa-
bility to execute its assigned mission. 
2.3.3.1.  The establish the airbase module will provide capabilities to build and modify existing
and deployed infrastructure (petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL), munitions storage and operat-
ing sites, maintenance shelters, tents, electrical), command and control mission specific forces,
expand to 24-hour day/night mission operations, enhance force protections, communications and
airbase operations as necessary. This module initiates on or after C-0 and overlaps the ef forts of
the open module. The effectiveness of this module is dependent upon integration with open the
airbase and generate the mission modules. The module is estimated to be at IOC in approximately
10 days. 
2.3.3.2.  This module contains forces that increase exped itionary airfield capabilities to support
expanded and sustainment operations. This includes:  lodging, finance, aerial port, infrastructure,
emergency response (fire crash rescue, medical, security forces, safety and EOD), personnel sup-
port for contingency operations (PERSCO) and communications. 
2.3.4.  Generate the Mission. This force module contains the capabilities to conduct the desired mili-
tary and mission effects required by the combatant commander. This module combines two subordi-
nate force modules: a Core UTC package (CUP) and a mission platform package. The CUPs contain
the lead aviation package and dir ect aviation support (e.g. maintenance, munitions, etc) associated
with the aviation capability. CUP titles usually identify the type of aircraft deployed. The mission plat-
form package contains combat support capabilities that support th e aviation package (e.g. weather,
intelligence, operations support, maintenance supervision and communications). 
2.3.4.1.  The mission support elements of this force module may begin to flow before C+0 day and
will overlap the open and establish modules. Mission generation is not achievable without integra-
tion of open, C2 and establish modules. This module is intended to conduct operations within 36
hours of initial arrival and will be at IOC in approximately 80 hours from the start of the open the
airbase module. 
2.3.4.2.  The ability of this force module to reach IOC is heavily dependent on the strategic flow
of resources and the deployment of mission aircraft and operators. 
2.3.5.  Operate the Airbase. This module contains the mission support capabilities needed to achieve
full operating capability. Forces in this module make initial operating capabilities more robust and can
sustain mission generation forces for up to 30 days. 
2.3.5.1.  The module provides capabilities to enhance force protection, cargo handling, quality of
life activities (chaplain, fitness, library, health care, feeding and sheltering) and reach-back capa-
bilities (supply, U.S. mail, military pay). This module begins to flow on or after C+2 and reaches
closure on or before day C+14. The module is estimated to be at IOC approximately 7 days from
arrival. 
2.3.5.2.  The operate the airbase module begins the transition from austere and initial construction
standards to temporary construction standards as directed by mission duration and combatant
commander requirements. 
2.4.  Bare Base Terminology, Definitions and Types. A bare base is defined as a location with a func-
tional runway, taxiway, parking areas and a source of water that can be made potable. The location was
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
15
chosen to make the base capable  of supporting all assigned and supporting aircraft and provide mission
essential resources in a timely an d combat effective manner. These resources would include logistical
support and service to the infrastructure composed of people, facilities, equipment and supplies. This bare
base concept requires prepackaged mobile facilities, utilities and support equipment that can be rapidly
deployed and installed. Expeditionary airbases are de fined by the level of infrastructure, development,
operational duration and missions that are present or will be deployed to the area. By combining the type
of airbase with the outlined facilities  standards listed later in this chapter, the CE planner can greatly
reduce the time required to identify, validate and source requirements for various locations. The various
types of expeditionary airfields include forward operating location, forward operating base, main operat-
ing base, intermediate staging area and warm base. 
2.4.1.  Forward Operating Location (FOL). FOLs are airfields utilized for short-term, operationally
defined missions such as counter-drug or combat search and rescue (CSAR) and have very limited
facilities and amenities. A FOL is normally an austere location requiring very little engineering effort
to execute mission requirements. 
2.4.2.  Forward Operating Base (FOB). FOBs are airfields used to support tactical, CSAR and recon-
naissance operations without establishing full support facilities. FOBs may be used for an extended
duration. Support by a main operating base will be required to provide backup support for a forward
operating base. 
2.4.3.  Main Operating Base (MOB). Main operating bases are normally occupied by a wing or larger
population (550 personnel or more), are continuously operated and posses in-place Air Expeditionary
Wing (AEW) command structures, robust expeditionary combat support (ECS) and logistics func-
tions. 
2.4.4.  Intermediate Staging Base (ISB). An ISB is a location or airfie ld used to stage forces prior to
inserting combat forces into the forward theater of operations. Du ring OIF, the US Army utilized
Doha, Kuwait as a staging and positioning area for the 4 th Infantry Division prior to the initiation of
combat operations in Iraq. ISBs have lar ge transient cargo and personnel requirements and normally
require greater planning factors for cargo ramps and ECS to accommodate large throughput of assets. 
2.4.5.  Warm Base. A warm base is  defined as a prepositioned lo cation where initial beddown infra-
structure development and prepositioning of assets has occurred th at allow for the rapid deployment
of personnel and weapons systems to an expeditionary location. During OEF and OIF, the Air Force
heated up bases at Masirah Island, Al Udeid, Seeb and Thumrait to enable the rapid mobilization of
hundreds of aircraft and thousands of personnel. 
2.5.  Construction Standards Definitions and Terminology. The combatant commander specifies the
construction standards for all facilities in theater. These standards are established to ensure that facilities
meet mission requirements while minimizing the engineering effort expended for planning and standard-
ize quality of life throughout the theater of operation. The following definitions expand those established
in JP 4-04 and define the construction standards of bare bases and their minimum facility requirements. 
2.5.1.  Expeditionary Standard Airbase. An expeditionary standard airbase is a subset of the initial
standard defined in Chapter 1. They are designed and constructed on an expedient basis, using
organic and service provided equipment and systems and/or host nation resources to support mission
durations of up to 90 days. Focus will be on providing support, faciliti es and infrastructure systems
16
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
necessary to move, receive and beddown deploying forces. Expeditionary standards would be seen at
short term FOL and FOB locations. 
2.5.2.  Initial Standard Airbase. An initial standard airbase is designed and constructed on an expedi-
ent basis and is characterized by austere facilities requiring minimal engineering effort to initiate mis-
sion operations. They are intended for use by operational units upon arrival in theater for a limited
time ranging up to 6 months. Initial standard facilities may require replacement by more substantial or
durable facilities during the course of operations. The Air Force developed BEAR kits to support ini-
tial standard expeditionary airbase deployments. Initial standards would most likely be seen at FOL,
FOB and initial operations at MOB and ISB locations. 
Figure 2.3.  Initial Construction Standard at FOB in Afghanistan. 
2.5.3.  Temporary Standard Airbase. For deployments that are expected  to last up to 24 months and
where Military Construction Program permanent facilities (or even semi-permanent facilities) are not
required, temporary standard facilities should be programmed. Temporary standards are characterized
by minimum facilities requiring additional engineering effort above that required for initial standards.
Temporary standard airbases provide for sustained operations above the requirements of initial stan-
dards at locations where a long-term presence is not anticipated. The temporary standards may be
used from the start of an operation or as an upgrade from initial standards, if directed by the Combat-
ant Commander for mission requireme nts. Temporary standards should increase the efficiency of
operation, safety, durability, morale and health standards for deployed personnel. For command and
critical facilities, modular and/or K-Span style fac ilities can be constructed wi th buried water lines,
overhead and/or buried electrical distribution, lighting on poles, buried sewer lines, collection tanks
and pumping systems. Dormitories and some administrative functions may receive hard floors and
walls, or be upgraded or replaced with modular facilities as base growth and mission duration require.
General requirements are found within Joint Chief of S taff guidance and are depicted in Figure 2.4.
Theater commanders may vary standards as the situation, forces and location dictates. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006

Figure 2.4.  Temporary Construction Standards for Lodging. 
2.5.4.  Enduring Presence Construction Standard. For deployments that are anticipated to last longer
than two but less than 10 years, semi-permanent  standards should be planned, programmed and exe-
cuted. Semi-permanent standards are designed and constructed with finishes; materials and systems
selected for moderate energy efficiency; maintenance and life cycle costs. Semi-permanent construc-
tion standards may be utilized as initial beddown standards when directed by the component combat-
ant commander. Semi-permanent construction projects may exceed local base civil engineer and wing
authority levels. 
2.5.4.1.  CE planners must be  extremely knowledgeable about AF programming, funding and
authority levels when planning for semi-permanent locations. Ensure proper coordination with
theater level CE planners an d MAJCOM CE program director ates prior to initiating any
large-scale construction. 
2.5.4.2.  Enduring presence construction standards are normally set by ag reements between the
host nation and the United S tates and may include permanent or semi-permanent construction
standards. These agreements will often outlin e conditions and standards the US military must
adhere to while constructing on host nation property as well as cost sharing initiatives that may be
put in place to alleviate the expense to US operations. Semi-permanent airbases should be con-
structed with a prime emphasis on sustainment and survivability. 
2.5.5.  Warm Base Standards. Warm bases are designed and constructed with finishes, materials and
systems selected for sustaining a mobilization base within the theater of operations. A warm base may
be a separate facility with a contract caretaker f unction or a surge area collocated with an operating
base. Warm bases are positioned to be rapidly heated up through execution of task order contract line
items in the contractor caretaker contract. Current AF policy dictates that CE UTCs be deployed to
augment the contractor to ensure base camp is erected to US standards. 
2.6.  Expeditionary Airbase Development and Planning Process. The airbase development process
has four main components: antiterrorism and force protection, facility requirements, master planning and
construction management. 
2.6.1.  Antiterrorism and Force Protection (AT/FP). AT/FP and physical security concerns are critical
to the development of expeditionar y airbases and long-term military camps. Incorporating AT/FP
requirements into site planning, selection, and layout is a cr itical and often difficult process. It is
essential that CE and Securit y Forces planners work together to establish a realistic and executable
18
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
AT/FP plan to protect US personnel and AF assets. This partnership will ensure that the AT/FP plan is
an integrated design consistent with the airbase initial and long-range development plans. 
2.6.1.1.  Essential to the base camp planning effort is the early identification of the AT/FP require-
ments. Addressing AT/FP concerns early helps to ensure that site location and layout is compatible
with FP operations and mission accomplishment. Early development of AT/FP and physical secu-
rity requirements also helps to reduce both construction and manpower costs. It is easier and more
cost effective to establish security measures during the planning process than it is to apply AT/FP
and physical security requirements, after the fa ct. AT/FP measures must be considered and
included at all stages of beddown planning and base development. 
2.6.1.2.  IAW DOD Instruction 2000.16 ( DOD Antiterrorism Standards) and DOD 2000.12H
(DOD Antiterrorism Handbook) standards for construction of new facilities have been developed
to counter possible terrorist threats. These cons truction standards have specific requirements for
such measures as standoff distance, perimeter barriers and building construction. These minimum
standards must be incorporated into the construction of all facilities regardless of the identified
threat. Planners must ensure th at they reference command specific  publications regarding force
protection instructions. CENTAF, USAFE, SOUTHAF and PACAF all have supplemental instruc-
tions regarding FP construction standards. C ontact your theater level A7/CE planner for more
information. 
2.6.2.  Facility Requirements. The combatant comma nder establishes the base camp facility require-
ment standard for the theater of operations by operation order (OPORD) fragmentary order. This order
describes standards upon which components and subordinate units develop master plans for mission,
mission support, base and community support facilities and requi red utilities. These standards are
intended to provide the combatan t commander’s expectations to component commanders for base
camp living and operating conditions. 
2.6.3.  Master Planning. Master pla nning provides an integrated strategy for constructing and main-
taining required facilities while right-sizing budge ts, equipment sets and the CE UTC(s) required to
support expeditionary operations. The level of deta il of the base camp mast er plan depends on the
maturity of the location, the speed at which the operational need  for a base camp develops and the
expected length of stay. Master plans for expeditionary or initial standard camps may be simply a
sketch of the camp, while master plans for temporary or enduring pr esence camps will include fully
engineered construction plans based on complete surveys. Beddown and base planners should ensure
they utilize and comply with gui dance provided in UFC 4-010-01, Design: DOD Minimum Antiter-
rorism Standards for Buildings, and with UFC 3-260-01, Design: Airfield and Heliport Planning and
Design, when planning for AEF bases. 
2.6.3.1.  Theater level planners will establish a process to develop, approve and implement base
master plans. For joint and coalition bases, this mechanism must include representation from all
affected service components or coalition allies if applicable. 
2.6.3.2.  Using the established process, component commanders will develop base master plans
for intermediate staging and main operating airbases. Planning utilizing semi-permanent and per-
manent construction requires coordination and approval from your numbered air force and major
command programs directorate and civil engineer. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
19
2.6.3.3.  Theater level or  major command Engineer and Servi ces experts can provide technical
support and guidance for expeditionary airbase development if planning is occurring at the unit
level. 
2.6.4.  Construction Management. Executing units will track the development of base construction in
accordance with the master plan priorities and report progress in accordance with instructions pub-
lished by the A7/CE directorate. 
2.7.  Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Effective operations and maintenance programs will maxi-
mize the life expectancy of base temporary facilit ies at minimum cost to the government. As the opera-
tional situation develops, more pe rmanent structures and facilities may replace temporary facilities and
structures. Airbase units will follo w service regulations for the operatio ns and maintenance of facilities
and may hire civilian contractors to manage and operate the base support mission if the operational situa-
tion permits. 
2.8.  Expeditionary Facilities and Beddown Sets. Detailed listing for expeditionary facilities and bare
base beddown assets can be found in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide,
and AFH 10-222 Volume 1, Guide to Bare Base Development, and AFH 10-222 Volume 2, Guide to Bare
Base Assets. 
2.9.  Better Deployable Facilities. Facilities and equipment used after Viet Nam have been improved to
make them more deployable and livable. Major improvements were made to meet logistical and mission
requirements for increased deployability for mission and base support packages, with the greatest strides
occurring in the two decades between Viet Nam and Desert Shield. The post- World War II and Korea
Gray Eagle kits were heavy and bulky and required excessive man-hours to position and erect. Additional
equipment was added, but repackaged into sizes that are more manageable. This effort created the small
550-person Harvest Eagle packages of the early 1970s. Likewise, lar ger deployment kits were tested,
which led to the 1970s Harvest Bare packages. Harvest Bare was refined, but testing led to the purchase
of new equipment in the mid-1980s such as the Ha rvest Falcon system. The Harvest Falcon packages
were fielded to allow deployment support for a 3,300-person wing and up to 55,000 personnel total. 
2.10.  Transportability Issues versus Developmental Timelines. While more user and mission friendly
bare base beddown packages have evolved, the packages are still not light and small enough to allow
rapid deployment by the current fl eet of large frame transports. Table 2.1. shows the typical number of
aircraft missions required to s upport the deployment of the s tandard sets (without passengers aboard).
Additional missions may be required if additional site preparation is required. The erection of many cur-
rent deployment packages are also man-hour intens ive. This limits their application by smaller numbers
of personnel that deploy to a site on an ADVON or predeployment team, who must perform site surveys.
Also, the current Housekeeping sets are difficult to break up for use by small teams that require some ini-
tial short-term facilities. Given time for shipment and erection, these assets provided good support during
the initial phases of a deployment to Southwest Asia. During the fi rst few weeks of Operation DESERT
SHIELD deterrent efforts, the tonnage required fo r initial air and ground fo rce projection shipments
depended on air transport. The air transport system was totally choked in spite of many prepositioned civil
engineer assets in country or in USAFE and some personnel faced austere conditions. However, time lines
for Desert Storm actually allowed about 95 percent of the transferred force-buildup tonnage to be sent by
sealift. Keep in mind that the disparity in missions between the legacy (Harvest) sets and the BEAR sets
is due in part to the light/lean nature of BEAR and that BEAR has optional assets that are added only as
20
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
needed (e.g. ROWPUs, MAAS, revetmen t kits, various dome shelters, et c). These assets are sometimes
referred to as BEAR playbook options. 
Table 2.1.  Mission Support to Various Deployment Sets. 
2.11.  Airlift Limitations versus Developmental Timeline. To meet current AEF taskings, air transport
may be the only method of delivery for several months --this is recognized by all services. To meet their
needs, the Army developed the Force Provider deployment packages, which evolved from a cross-version
of Harvest Falcon-type assets packaged in Harvest Eagle-size packages. The Air Force has tested lighter
weight, more streamlined Harvest Falcon kits that address the phasing required to reach more remote, aus-
tere bases when these locations are airlift constrained. The Air Force is also developing and programming
replacement shelters and deployable electrical, water and sewerage sy stems that are lighter and more
deployable. The next decade is slated to see many improvements and changes to the deployment packages
to allow rapid beddown of forces to meet the full spectrum of contingency deployments. The programs for
managing and updating bare base a ssets now fall under the BEAR pr ogram. When possible, planners
should investigate the opportunity of utilizing sealift, convoys and railways to move large assets and free
up airlift. 
2.12.  Real World Transport/Logistics Lessons Learned : During Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF)
in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, RED HOR SE units in Europe were able to mobilize prepositioned heavy
equipment and beddown assets from Italy and move them via sealift and rail. On every occasion, the
assets arrived ahead of equipment and resources that were prioritized as critical assets and moved via air-
lift. The great advantage to sea and rail is the elimination of weight constraints that occur when moving by
air. Due to severe lack of Class IV construction material in Albania, Army and Navy teams had problems
erecting billeting, showers, latrines and other expeditionary combat support requirements. Within 7 days
of arrival at Albania, RED HORSE  had shipped in over 632 short tons of h eavy equipment embedded
with plywood, geo-textile materials, hand tools and other critical construction assets that were not being
moved due to airlift limitations. Coordination and lo cation of opportune sealift through Military Traffic

Management Command (MTMC) took three days. The shipment included environmental control units
(ECU), bundles of AM-2 mat, expeditionary shower/shave and latrine sets. Task Force Hawk had been on
the ground three weeks but it was not until the arrival of the RED HORSE assets that they received sani-
tary and hygiene facilities and ear th-moving heavy equipment. CE and RED HORSE planners coordi-
nated this effort outside of the prioritization of the OAF movement center and tactical airlift control center
(TACC). 
Figure 2.5.  Sealift of Military Equipment. 
2.13.  Mission Considerations. Requirements for changes in depl oyment packages are driven by AEF
mission considerations. To meet AEF rapid deployment, full-spectrum global commitments, some restric-
tions may have to be imposed for initial mission planning, such as: 
2.13.1.  Compression requirements for initial deployment timelines. 
2.13.2.  Restrictive limits on the number of support personnel on the ground during the initial 3 to 14
day periods. 
2.13.3.  Limited initial flow of equipment and support packages, as well as spreading out follow-up
packages over more airlift missions. 
2.13.4.  Sending selected mission support UTCs in prior to C+0 Day to ready the base. 
2.13.5.  Employing joint concepts  of support and deployment with Air National Guard, Air Force
Reserve Command, Army, Marine and Navy forces. 
2.13.6.  All of these may be considered upfront to meet theater commander air superiority and support
campaigns. Finally, the total number of transport aircraft available may be the critical factor for the-
ater locations that are landlocked, have no accessible or nearby seaports, or lack road or other avail-
able land routes. 
2.14.  Influence of Base Type and Location. Typical AEF mission planning considerations will depend
in a large part on the type and location of the depl oyment airbases. Mission timelines for initial support
force and equipment UTCs will be different for each of the following situations. 
22
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
2.14.1.  Austere airfields for support of missions by special oper ational forces, A-10s, MC- and
AC-130s and special operations and attack helicopters, where the initial arriving aircraft may be lim-
ited to C-17s and C-130s. 
2.14.2.  Large, former Soviet-bloc airfields that require some repair of hangars, maintenance facilities,
utilities and pavements, but can s upport all types of aircraft and te nt city beddowns and can be par-
tially supported with contracts, trucked-in supplies and modular facilities. 
2.14.3.  Recovered, enemy commercial and military ai rfields that have ether been denied during
enemy retrograde or coalition ai r and ground bombardment. These were the predominant airfields
occupied during the 2002-2003 OEF and OIF. 
2.14.4.  Typical bare bases, which can accompany initial fighters, transports (both military airlift and
Civil Reserve Air Fleet) and helicopter missions, but may have limited modes of supply and transport. 
2.14.5.  Large airbases with a full mix of aircraft  and support facilities from  numerous military ser-
vices or countries and supportable by several modes of transportation and supply.

Figure 2.7.  Various Construction Standards in Bosnia. 
2.15.  Developmental Timeline Considerations. Based on the Air Force Chief of S taff's Sight Pictures
and the Agile Combat Support (ACS ) Global Military Task Force (GMTF) program to implement AEF
deployments, the timelines for deployment are e nvisioned through a force mo dule approach. The Air
Force requires any upgrade of the bare base assets to be modular, scaleable and to meet the needs for fol-
low-on set consistency, maintaining full flying operational support and providing theater interoperability. 
2.15.1.  Timeline Goals. The typical timeline goal for a 3300-person beddown is fourteen days, with
initial flying operations achieved by C+72 Hours and sustainment operations phasing in after fourteen
days. In order to meet a full mi ssion capability within C+14 days, open the base efforts must be
planned to provide equipment and resources in response to mis sion and manning requirements that
allow for immediate build-up and beddown upon arrival at the expeditionary airbase. 
2.15.2.  Force Modules and BEAR Asse ts. To meet the timelines for force module IOC, BEAR sets
are packaged to more closely align with the goal of the force modules. For instance, BEAR sets are
streamlined for weight and TEMPER tents are being replaced with more readily deployable systems
that are simpler to erect with fewer personnel (the Small Shelter System was widely deployed during
OEF and OIF). The overall packagin g allows use without major tail oring to meet smaller mission
deployments or beddowns for joint operational support of other branch of service forces. These con-
cepts are depicted in Figure 2.8., which shows both the strategic roadmap force module timeline and
the conceptual modules for a BEAR package that would meet the requirements of deployment. 
24
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
Figure 2.8.  BEAR Sets Supporting a Force Module Beddown. 
2.15.3.  One major planning consideration is plugging in an open the airbase module (team) prior to
C+0 Day to begin beddown. With an open the airbase beddown package, which provides short-term
austere shelter and basic hygiene, a beddown team would initiate beddown with either a tailored Har-
vest Eagle system or BEAR system (when fully adopted). For civil engineers, the open the airbase
team could include a combination of RED HORSE, Prime BEEF and 49 th Material Maintenance
Group (49 MMG) BEAR team personnel to prepare the site, erect and install facilities, equipment and
some utilities. For locations that are not in higher threat areas, planning for these types of bases should
consider use of one of the contractor augmen tation programs for early beddown opera tions. These
programs are the Air For ce Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP), the Army Logistics Civil
Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) and the Navy Contingency Construction Capability (CONCAP).
These are covered more broadly in Chapter 8 of this volume. 
2.16.  Engineering Considerations. Most of the engineering pla nning factors and detailed mechanical
procedures for calculating requirements are covered in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5. These civil engineer
considerations are based primarily on AEF lessons learned. 
2.17.  Survey, Expeditionary Site Mapping (formerly GeoReach) and Other Information Based
Plans. Deploying units and theater planners must have  good information on what is at a location and
available nearby. Developing a bare base support plan requires accurate information. Knowing what mis-
sions will be present is a major factor in determin ing what should be included  and the amount of detail
required. Experience with OAF, OEF, and Operation NOBLE ANVIL has shown that AEF missions can
be much more fluid than previous Air Force depl oyments, usually because other services and partner
nation military services are involved. 
2.17.1.  When there is a requirement to support new contingency missions, there may not be a specific
operation plan (OPLAN) that provides specific details for the location. Rather, an operations plan in
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
25
concept form (CONPLAN) may have to be used to deter mine basic requirements. Whether an
OPLAN or CONPLAN is used, an all-services, Timed-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD)
is required that is associated with the base. The TPFDD database will contain all forces (except possi-
ble specifics on special operations forces) and the deployment timing required to deploy in support of
an OPLAN or CONPLAN. 
2.17.2.  Problems can develop when all potential missions are not well defined; when this occurs, civil
engineer planners must make assumptions based on the best information available with respect to total
mission requirements. Theater ADVON teams, through the Expediti onary Site Survey Process
(ESSP), may have surveyed the site and created an Expeditionary Site Mapping comprehensive instal-
lation picture (CIP) with GPS  located survey inputs. Some of the more specific requirements for
potential mission support of an airfield may be available from site surveys conducted by Air Mobility
Operations Groups (AMOG), Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCE), Contingency Response
Groups (CRG), Special Tactics Teams (STTs) and previously completed Base Support Plans (BSPs)
or theater Civil Engineer Support Plans (CESPs). It is imperative that A7 or theater level CE planners
have the appropriate security clearance level for joint and AF war plan efforts. 
2.17.3.  With the exception of support to special operations forces, you should be able to obtain and
review (before going on the surv ey) the TPFDD to determine the basic deployment forces that will
drive the population-based requirements. Examples of basic information are the number of aircraft by
type, the total base population and the phased base population over time, transient forces and expected
duration of the operation. 
2.17.4.  Good sources of information are operations  plans, base maps, aerial photographs, construc-
tion drawings, past site surveys, data contained in intelligence office documents, information from a
previously deployed unit and in formation from the theater, Aerospace Expeditionary Force Center
(AEFC), or MAJCOM staffs. Until Expeditionary Site Mapping has reached full maturity, civil engi-
neers need to obtain both un classified and classified information as best they can for each initial
deployment. When replacing a deployed unit, incoming civil engineers should use the SECRET Inter-
net Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and s ecure telecommunications to determine what may
really be required to replace the current force for sustainment operations. 
2.18.  Airfield Surveys and Operational Data Collection. The success of an expeditionary airfield is
directly related to the condition of the runway. This is reflected in the effort the Combined Force Air
Component Commander (CFACC), Combined Force Land Component Command (CFLCC) and various
organizations put into the deploymen t of numerous pavement evaluation teams. In light of limited and
constricted transportation into many of these areas, it is critical that planners identify the correct require-
ment and task the appropriate team. The following teams and their capabilities are listed to assist in this
selection. 
2.18.1.  AFCESA Pavement Evaluation Team. The AFCESA Pavement Evaluation Team is governed
by AFI 32-1041, Airfield Pavement Evaluations. The AFCESA Pavement Evaluation program
focuses on airfield support to MAJCOM/NAF/CFACC and bases by providing the following services
for both peacetime and contingency operations: 
2.18.1.1.  Develop pavement guidance and criteria. 
2.18.1.2.  Perform airfield structural pavement evaluations. 
2.18.1.3.  Perform airfield frictional characteristics (skid) evaluations. 
26
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
2.18.1.4.  Provide technical support to the MAJCOM and bases. 
2.18.2.  Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCE). Air Mobility Command (AMC) trained, equipped
and tasked airfield evaluation teams perform site surveys to determine airfield suitability for aircraft
operations. TALCE units are tasked through HQ AMC-TACC/ XOPM, Scott AFB, DSN 779-3071.
Airfield surveys are published on AMC IMT 174, Ai rfield Survey, and are used to update Airfield
Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR). ASRRs include airfield geometry assessment, naviga-
tional aids (NAVAID), hazards to flight determinations, aircraft parking area aprons, pavement flow
capabilities, and maximum (aircraft) on ground (MOG) capacity. 
2.18.3.  Global Assessment Teams (GAT) were created by AMC during OEF to serve as the advance
planning team for AMOG/TALCE units. GATs establish austere initial airfield operations. GATs are
tasked through HQ AMC-TACC/XOPM, Scott AFB, DSN 779-3071. 
2.18.4.  Contingency Response Groups (CRG) are a first-in, mu lti-discipline force that secure and
establish airfield operations. CRG are comprised of  Security Forces, Initial Airlift Support, Civil
Engineering and Communications. CRG are positioned and equipped for short-term operations and
deployment. CRGs are tasked through the Unified Combatant Command and equipped to complete
airfield surveys as detailed on AMC Form 174. 
2.18.5.  RED HORSE units are mobile, heavy construction squadrons that are equipped to provide air-
field assessment and repairs. 
2.18.6.  Special Tactics Teams (STT) are Special Operations team s used to survey and certify
semi-prepared airfields, landing zones and assault strips via AF  Forms 3822 and ASRR. Surveys
include geometrics, NAVAIDS, hazards to flight, semi-prepared airfield load bearing capability. STT
are tasked by the 720th Special Tactics Group at Hurlburt Field, Florida, DSN 579-4250. 
2.18.7.  Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) standardizes the process of producing airfield sur-
vey data and providing decision makers with reli able and substantive mission planning information.
ESSP deploys survey teams of high trained individuals to perform pavement evaluation, full spectrum
threat assessment, airfield suitability reports and beddown surveys with LOGCAT/Expeditionary Site
Mapping integration. The directorate of logistics readiness (HQ US AF/ILG) is responsible for Air
Force ESSP policy and guidance, while the MAJCOM logistics plans function provides oversight for
all expeditionary site surveys in their AOR. Additional information on ESSP roles and responsibilities
can be found in AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning. 
2.18.8.  The National Geospatial -Intelligence Agency (NGA; formerly the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency or NIMA) has completed surveys of all airfields worldwide. During Operations
NOBLE ANVIL, OAF, OEF and OIF planners utilized these surveys for beddown planning purposes.
This proved risky since less than 1%  of structural data is taken fr om true technical information. The
majority of facility capacity and capability is estimated from imager y taken of similar airfields or is
taken from reports of airfield managers. This data may be skewed by host nations for political or eco-
nomic reasons. NGA information provides a good initial baseline and satellite imagery for initial plan-
ning. 
2.19.  Priority Requirements During Planning. Based on lessons learned, it is very important to iden-
tify those items, which must be in the initial support packages, but are not normally included. If a standard
deployment package flows as establis hed in the TPFDD and a site survey  shows that there is a critical
need to have another package compon ent arrive earlier, then this is a major concern that should be ele-

vated. Heavyweight, large-cube items, such as construction equipment, fire trucks and dump trucks, have
been left on a ramp at an intermediate aerial port or back at a theater's prepositioned-storage site awaiting
airlift support when transportation flows are airlift constrained. Based on the mission, surveys must deter-
mine if initial beddown activities can be accomplished without a large amount of site preparation. If initial
beddown efforts require these assets, then alternate procedures, scheduling or support may be required to
allow this to happen. Actions must  be coordinated between theater planners, the AEF wing and United
States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). Here is an example. 
2.19.1.  A former Soviet base now controlled by a partner nation will be used for a force beddown. If
you just looked at aerial photos and used old Soviet-era intelligence reports, the base would appear to
have an adequate runway, taxiway and ramp, as well as a water source and some damaged flightline
buildings that can be easily repaired. However, a site survey might show that the base is on a
rock-hard, rocky surface that has toxic environmental spills affecting some areas of the ground surface
and water sources. While expedient repairs to existing facilities are practical, they would require
structural work and for safety reasons, these efforts would have to be completed prior to occupancy. 
2.19.2.  If the deployment buildup were to be phased in over several months, the base could be devel-
oped without deploying additional up-front resources. However, if a 3300-person bare base were
required by C+23 Day, then the TPFDD would have to be adjusted. Deployment packages should be
tailored to reflect Prime BEEF UTCs as one of the initial teams arriving with AFCAP (or other con-
tractors) and RED HORSE personnel to: clean up or contain the spill, conduct more arduous surface
preparations, repair the flightline buildings and possibly drill a well, provide additional reverse osmo-
sis water purification units (ROWPU) or supply an alternative means for obtaining drinking water. 
2.20.  Coalition or Host Nation Support Capabilities and Limitations. A host nation (HN) is a nation
where US military personnel are deployed by government invitation or international agreement. A partner
nation is a nation where US  military personnel deploy by  government invitation or international agree-
ment and their military forces may be participants under a military agreement or  treaty. A host nation's
resources, assets and facilities may exist at the location and may be available for use or support. Theater
and State Department sources, such as military liaison offices or partner nation military personnel on sta-
tion, can sometimes provide valuable information on host nation capabilities and information on: con-
tracts, sources of supply, availability of equipment and materials (as well as an idea of the cost to do
business) and points of contact w ith the local government. Another im portant piece of information per-
tains to the willingness of a host nation to provide facility and utility support and joint use of assets. 
2.20.1.  The availability of HN s upport may enable CE units to reduce support and transportation
requirements by securing formal and informal agreements with HN authorities. Contact your wing or
theater judge advocate for guidance prior to entering into any agreements or interpretation of existing
agreements. The Joint Forces Commander (JFC) usually establishes a single office to serve as the
executive agency to manage and coordinate host nation support during wartime. Airbase and Air
Component Command representatives use this of fice, according to JFC regulations and guidelines,
when entering into any formal agreement with HN authorities. 
2.20.2.  Units that deployed in support of OEF found that conducting smaller humanitarian and civic
assistance (HCA) support projects for local communities often improved the overall ability to obtain
local resources and labor for on-base work. Even when there are few local resources, it is good to con-
duct humanitarian efforts to improve the political climate in terms of host nation support for the loca-
tion and effort. It is important that outgoing civil engineers orient, familiarize and even introduce their
28
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
replacement to key local and re gional government points of contact. Even with the willingness of
local officials to support deployment efforts, sometimes there are economic or physical constraints
that affect use of the deployment site. 
2.20.3.  When leasing of land is a problem, deployed AEF units have found that Army Contingency
Real Estate Support Teams (CRESTs) can often provide support in-theater. CRESTs can obtain
longer-term leases, provide needed continuity when  dealing with local officials and landowners and
have more contracting authority than Air Force contracting. Your theater civil engineer staff can facil-
itate CREST assistance. 
2.21.  Mine/UXO Presence. Many bare bases have been esta blished through long-term government
agreements with traditional treaty or agreement allies/partners; the bases were readied with peacetime
construction programs. AEF deployments within a theater's area of responsibility (AOR) must often rely
on use of airfields or airports that have been ma de available on a short-term  basis and often may have
been exposed to ethnic, sectarian, or regional violence. When this is the case, opening the airfield and the
surrounding airfield environment for base beddown usually becomes a much greater problem and danger-
ous situation due to mine fields and UXOs. 
2.21.1.  Air Force and other service EOD teams usually have to enter the location first and start clear-
ing the runway and the areas adjacent to it, the taxiways and aprons. Initial forces can then land, off-
load equipment and stay in any adjacent area that  has been cleared of mines and UXOs. However ,
actual layout of the base, construction of outlying and nearby defensive fighting positions, positioning
and erection of shelters and running of utilities becomes a slow process as EOD teams clear each area
one portion after another. This usually requires mine detection and safing or demolition and identifi-
cation, as well as safing and disposal or demolition of UXOs. 
2.21.2.  Mines or UXOs that have been rendered safe by in-place demolition will also require subse-
quent leveling and grading of the craters. For areas with many mines, additional equipment may be
required from Army, British, or combat engineers from other capable countries with mine dozers/
plows or flails. Again, additional site preparations may be required to recover the areas where plows
had to be used. 
2.21.3.  With these basic precautions, beddown can proceed within cleared areas for erection of facil-
ities and surface layout of utilities. However, burying utilities can be a very slow process. Mines and
UXOs located below the surface (especially in areas subject to flooding with drifting soil/sand), could
explode when hit or uncovered by tr enching for utilities. EOD teams ma y have to scan or sweep for
additional UXOs and mines directly along the pathways for utility trenching. 
2.22.  Considerations for Joint Operations Beddowns. Do not assume that another service is preparing
the support plan or is planning to take on the base operating support responsibility. Do not assume that the
Air Force or another service will be in charge when you arrive. Air Force and Army lessons learned from
initial AEF deployments to remote, joint service bases showed that the initial command structures at these
locations were often too fluid for anyone to be in  charge during the initial beddown operations, and the
overall command and control of th e location could change several times from initial beddown through
sustainment. Changes in base missions cause extraordinary increases in personnel and the need for sup-
port services and facilities. Unit deployment planners must work with theater civil engineers and planners
to identify locations that will be used for major staging operations. During OEF, some bases expanded
from an expected 300 persons to over 7,000 persons. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006

2.23.  Support Plans. When an airfield had no previous survey for beddown requirements, the first units
in need to know what other units are coming so they can determine the general size and layout of the base.
For sizing purposes only, base planners should consider as a contingency scenario that unit departures
may overlap with unit arrivals and that both may have to operate on the base for some time. They should
also take into account that expedient sanitation facilities may have to be used initially, which can create
the need for additional land area. Finally, joint service may also mean that partner nation military forces
are employed at the location besides just US Army , Navy or Marine units. Beddown planners must be
given the full picture on who will be at the location and when they will serve. Ideally an expeditionary site
mapping-based theater CESP or AEF BSP would include a base layout, which would address all missions
and be coordinated by other stakeholder service branches. This is rare. More frequently, the initial AEF
civil engineer force will arrive at a location and have to report to the interim, ranking AF officer (such as
the TALCE commander). This is because the initial forces from other services at joint service bases are
often combat forces, which do not have base construction resp onsibility. Careful consideration during
planning must be given to servi ce munition operation/storage requirements because of their associated
explosive safety quantity distance (ESQD) arcs which limit available beddown areas. 
2.23.1.  When TPFDD based informat ion is used for initial beddow n planning and layout, develop
support plans and layouts to take into account all the beddown resources that will be used that are
compatible. Until Air Force Harvest Falcon systems and Army Force Provider systems become
interoperable for utilities (either through changes in the utility systems or conversion kits), like sys-
tems may have to be grouped with specific personnel (i.e., Army with Force Provider). Unless there is
adequate room to separate services for independence of efforts, plan on siting in common groupings
as much as possible (to allow connection of compatible utility systems), such as billeting and support
service areas, maintenance and industrial areas, flightline areas, medical facilities and separated muni-
tions areas. If other services' engi neers or planners are present, use their knowledge and skills when
developing the layout, as they should be more familiar with their service's requirements. Army engi-
neers can be valuable when planning for sustainment, as many have an automated beddown program
(i.e. Theater Construction Management System) that provides basic de signs and bills of material for
various types of construction, facilities and standards. 
2.23.2.  While Air Force units have ta ken some pressure for wanting to provide quality of life living
standards and facilities too early in base development, other services have faced the problem of not
identifying early enough clearly defined living standards for base camps and staging bases. Theater
commanders should have identified acceptable living standards to plan for during initial deployments. 
2.23.3.  Many joint service bases are supposed to be purple suit operations with shared responsibilities
for base operations support. In other cases, one service may open the base and maintain responsibility,
or take over the responsibility for all support. The TPFDD addresses the requirement for support of an
airbase and/or base camp. In some cases, it is essential that other services provide or augment initial
key bare base skills, such as fire protection, bio-environmental, utilities (water and waste), power gen-
eration and environmental (pest management). When the TPFDD requires the Air Force to be sup -
ported by these personnel early on in the deploymen t, AEF civil engineers and planners should
contact the other services’ units and coordinate arrival schedules to ensure that the other services’
engineers can be there as schedul ed in the TPFDD. Be aware that  often these engineering personnel
would not be mobilized early enough for initial support, since they typically arrive when their service
accepts responsibility for base operating support. There absence could delay beddown of facilities and
utilities or cause crucial delays in overall beddown.

2.24.  Expeditionary Combat Support (formerly Base Operating Support). ECS includes the provi-
sion of supplies, vehicle maintenance, civil engineering support, services support (including food service,
billeting, laundry, mortuary affairs, recreation centers and fitness centers), communications, security and
general administrative support. During AEF deployments for OEF, it became evident that there was a
basic difference in the ECS concept of operation between the Air Force and the Army. 
2.24.1.  AEFs deploy as a wing (or a portion of a wi ng with groups and squadrons from other bases)
and form an AEW. Air Force ECS is integral with the wing structure. 
2.24.2.  The Army has combat engineers and support personnel to support mobile combat operations,
but they do not perform the ECS function. The Army has various support battalions that provide sta-
tionary base operating support, but most of these are reserves. For combined base camps/airfields ini-
tially supported by the Air Force a nd partner nation engineers, Army units often could not take over
ECS until all preparations were in place. 
2.24.3.  Check deployment orders to ensure that theater planners have addressed base operating sup-
port and transfer of responsibility. Start early on in the deployment to track and account for resources
to ensure that equipment/assets can be reassigned during transfer of responsibility. In some cases, an
Air Expeditionary Group may have to remain at the location to support Air Force personnel and mon-
itor/control equipment/asset accounting. 
2.25.  Command and Control Relationships. When the deployed location is designated as a numbered
AEW, whether or not the expeditionary civil engineer squadron is primarily from one base or is composed
of numerous units or individuals, it is important that all Air Force civil engineers are formed together (and
billet together) as a unit. This t ype relationship may be harder to enforce when civil engineer forces
include Air Force, Army/Navy/Marine (i.e., other service branches), or international personnel assigned
for support of the airbase. The best policy is to integrate similar forces into one designated work-tasking
unit, whether the unit is a blue, purple, or plaid suite operation, not withstanding any possible need to sep-
arately billet by service/nation.

Chapter 3   
PLANNING FOR BASE OPERATING AND SUPPORT FACILITIES 
3.1.  Overview. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines each have differing standards for base Operating
Support. This chapter establishes planning guidelines, authorizations and standards for contingency bases
at various stages of development. 
Figure 3.1.  Bare Base Sighted Alongside Host Nation Facilities. 
3.2.  Purpose. To provide definitions and st andards for facilities, utilities and personnel support within
forward operating locations, forward operating bases, main operations and intermediate staging area air-
bases. 
3.3.  Facility Standards for Base Camps. During the evolution of a con tingency airbase, infrastructure
and facilities will progress from initial to semi-permanent construction standards depending on mission
requirements and operational duration. Definition and de scription of authorized end-state facility con-
struction standards are listed in Table 3.2., pages 3-4 through 3-6. The Component Commander of
CFACC has the authority to establish expeditionary airbases at any construction standard based on opera-
tional requirements and resource availability. AF guidance on authorized facility requirements and stan-
dards is listed later in this chapter (Expeditiona ry Airbase Development Matrix) and in AFH 32-1084,
Facility Requirements. This guidance applies to al l base camps, regardless of the stage of development.
The matrix clarifies the desired construction quality for each facility at various stages of development. It
is understood that meeting these standards will be a progressive effort. Theater and MAJCOM CE staffs
will strive to meet the standards contained in this chapter as quickly as the operational, resource and coor-
dination (programming, approval and funding for semi-permanent and permanent standards) situation
allows. 
3.4.  Force Protection and Safety. Antiterrorism force protection and p hysical security in the expedi-
tionary environment present unique challenges to planners, engineers and security forces. The threat type,
32
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
severity and desired level of protection are the primary considerations when selecting AT/FP and physical
security measures. These considerations will be used to identify vulne rabilities, reduction measures and
the siting of facilities. In the expeditionary envi ronment, important security planning factors include:
availability of existing facilities, types of structures, existing natural or man-made features, types and
quantity of indigenous construction materials, avai lable real estate and ot her base infrastructure.
Pre-existing buildings will be renovated to meet DOD, AF and CFACC force protection and security stan-
dards. These standards will provide guidance for developing strategies to mitigate the effects of specific
aggressor tactics, defined levels of protection and ef fects on building costs of applying those measures.
Specific force protection measures and planning considerations are detailed in Chapter 7 of this volume. 
3.4.1.  UFC 4-010-01, Design: DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, outlines the
threat level and construction requ irements for facilities in both expeditionary and permanent bases.
Table 3.1. is extracted from UFC 4-010-01 to give the CE planner an idea of the required level of AT
construction standards and the impli cations of the various standards for expeditionary construction.
These factors will allow the CE planner to adequately brief the combined forces commander or theater
planner on ramifications of progr amming and funding for construction at various levels. Ultimately,
the component commander, with the guidance of his staff civil engineer, will be responsible for defin-
ing construction standards for their various bases as outlined in Chapter 1 of this publication. 
3.4.2.  Levels of protec tion are described in Table 3.1., Table 3.2. and Table 3.3.. These standards
provide a low level of protection for billeting and primary gathering buildings because of the higher
concentration of personnel and attractive nature of the target. The effects of utilization of various stan-
dards of protection can be  mitigated by additional active and passive measures such as increased
standoff distances, perimeter fencing, alarming etc.  The impact of increased AT standards results in
significant improvement to the facility and person nel survivability but comes at the expense of
increased funding, beddown execution timelines and res ources. These must be balanced to meet the
CC’s mission requirements. 
3.5.  Authorized and Required Facilities. As part of the deployment planning and base beddown pro-
cess outlined in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5, it is imperative to ensure that limited resources are applied to
prioritized mission requirements. The bottom line during planning is that there will never be enough space
and assets to make everyone happy and give them what they think they deserve. In light of this, it is up to
the civil engineer planners and mission support group planners to ove rsee the planning board and mini-
mize conflict. Table 3.2. provides some basic guidelines on facility authorization at different contingency
locations to better facilitate some of the facility utilization planning.

EXPEDITIONARY STANDARD.  Characterized by extremely austere facilities requiring minimal engineer effort to initiate operations.  Intended for limited operational
duration (< 90 days).  Intended for operational personnel and resources only.  Support and supply operations to be maintained by host unit at support MOB or ISB. 
INITIAL STANDARD.  Characterized by austere facilities requiring minimal engineer effort.  Intended for immediate operational use by units upon arrival for a limited 
operational duration (up to 6 months).  May require replacement by more substantial or durable facilities during the course of operations and mission growth. 
TEMPORARY STANDARD.  Characterized by austere facilities requiring additional engineer effort above that required for initial standard facilities.  Intended to 
increase efficiency of operations for use up to 24 months.  Provides for sustained operations.  Replaces initial standard where mission requirements dictate.  Temporary 
standards may be used initially if directed by the combatant commander. 
ENDURING PRESENCE STANDARD.  Characterized by well-developed facilities & infrastructure requiring additional engineer effort above that required for 
temporary standard facilities.  Intended to increase operational efficiency for use over 24 months.  Provides for sustained operations through more durable construction 
materials, better energy conservation systems, & master planning efforts.  Requires programming, funding, design, & construction management through theater C7 or 
MAJCOM A7. 
WARM BASE STANDARD.  Characterized by well developed infrastructure requiring additional engineer effort for opening the airbase.  Intended to increase speed of
beddown by requiring erection of prepositioned tents, resources and assets.  Maintained by caretaker organization (military unit or civilian contract).  Warm bases are
identified and established by the theater C7 and/or MAJCOM/NAF A7.

3.6.  Facility Construction Standards. Table 3.3. provides guidance on the authorized facility construc-
tion standards as defined by mission duration and weapons systems requirements. Construction standards
are detailed in Chapter 2 of this volume. The component commander may authorize any construction
standard for beddown and bare base  construction, as long as it conf orms to Air Force programming and
funding authorization and guidelines as listed in AFIs 32-1021, -1022, -1023 and Chapter 6 of this vol-
ume. 
3.6.1.  Billeting Standards. Initial billeting standards for all con tingency bases is utilization of host
nation facilities, BEAR or Force Provider tentage utilizing the pla nning factors listed later in this
chapter for space requirements. Depending on mission requirements and airbase operational duration,
housing may be improved to modular facilities or semi-permanent style dormitories. Theater level CE
planning staffs will dictate the level and speed of billeting upgrades based on the CF ACC’s mission
requirements. It is critical that the theater and contingency base engineers plan for a surge billeting

capability to respond to changes in war plans and base mission requirements. To accommodate popu-
lation surges/transients, expeditionary airbases will maintain the ability to house 110% of its total nor-
mal population at all times. If the base is utilizing temporary or semi-permanent construction standard
billets (SEA huts, modulars, etc.) surge capacity may be accomplished through utilization of available
BEAR or Force Provider tentage. 
3.6.2.  Rotary Wing Aviation Facilities. Helicopter landing and parking pads may initially be S tabi-
lized Earth or AM-2 Matting to prevent foreign object damage (FOD). Landing/parking pads will be
upgraded to concrete or asphalt with adequate grounding rods an d tie-downs. Treat all soil in the
immediate area of the pads to reduce FOD. Pla ce HESCO bastions or similar materials around hot
arming pads to minimize damage from accidental mi ssile discharge. At a minimum, outfit one heli-
copter-landing pad on each base camp with landing lights for reduced visibility operations. 
3.6.3.  Maintenance Facilities Planning Consider ations. The responsible component shall provide
appropriate aircraft maintenance structures in accordance with the number/type of aircraft supported.
Coordinate with theater or deploying Logistics/Maintenance planner for facility requirements. 
3.6.4.  Medical Facilities Planning Considerations. Develop plans for health clinics, dental clinics and
hospitals in coordination with the responsible component Health Facility Planning Office. Design and
construct medical facilities in accordance with the responsible operational command’s standards. The
Air Force has developed multiple deployable medical treatment facilities (MTFs) to treat and evacu-
ate casualties under all conditions. The Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) system is composed
of more than 170 equipment a nd personnel building block UTCs to  meet the spectrum of medical
response needs. EMEDS is deployed in expandable components and its facilities range in size from
four bed holding areas to 114-bed theater hospitals able to treat a population at risk of over 5000 per-
sonnel. See Volume 5 of this pamphlet series for detailed civil engineer support requirements for
expeditionary medical facilities. 
3.6.5.  Transportation Maintenance Facilities. The responsible component will design and construct
vehicle maintenance facilities. The vehicle maintenance facilities will evolve as the base camp
matures to support the mission. 
3.6.5.1.  Maintenance Facilities. The facility should be equipped with environmental control units
and electricity when the operational situation allows. 
3.6.5.2.  Fuel Truck Parking. Secondary containment pads are required for fuel truck parking. The
containment pads will be equi pped with a collection sump an d grounding rods for parked fuel
trucks. 
3.6.6.  Hazardous Waste Accumulation Points. Construct hazardous waste accumulation points IAW
the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD). Responsible Component Com-
manders may authorize additional ac cumulation points as required. Each base will designate a base
engineer responsible for all hazardous material management and hazardous waste collection and dis-
posal. 
3.6.7.  Solid Waste Disposal. Solid Waste Disposal will be in accordance with the OEBGD. The
responsible component will authorize the environmentally-appropriate method of disposal of solid
waste such as use of incineration or use of landfills. 
3.6.8.  Fuel Storage. Above ground fuel tanks are authorized for the storage of bulk fuels at long term
camps. When fuel bladders are necessary, site them according to the OEBGD. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
47
3.6.9.  Munitions Storage Areas (MSA). Construct MSA in accordance with the responsible compo-
nent’s guidance. Munitions storage areas will have containment berms, a fenced and lighted perimeter,
graveled access roads and lightning protection. Store ammunition in protective structures that are not
in contact with the ground (i.e. on wooden pallets or on concrete foundations). 
3.6.10.  Kennels. Where military working dogs are authorized for an operation, the responsible com-
ponent will provide kennel facilities to sustain the operation. Kennel facilities will evolve as the base
camp matures to include environmental controls, electrical service and exercise yard. 
3.6.11.  Mortuary Affairs. Morgues will be in accordance with the standards in Joint Publication 4-06,
Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations. Regardless of the
type of base camp, privacy screens will be installed around the entire morgue facility. 
3.6.12.  Distinguished visitor (DV) and guest quarters. Main operations and logistics hub base camps
will have DV and guest quarters. 
3.7.  Utilities. Design utility systems based on current applicable military handbooks, technical manuals
and guidance. Refer to Attachment 3 (Base Camp Development Matrix) for the recommended facilities
for each level of base camp development. 
3.8.  Electric Power.  
3.8.1.  Electrical Grid Development. As the base camp matures, and where economically supportable
and practicable, connect base camp power grids to commercial power. Smaller or remote base camps
that cannot be economically connected to a commercial power grid should install central power plants
with the capacity to support 12 5% of the peak electrical  demand in accordance with component
requirements. During planning phase, give careful consideration to desired electrical system end-state
as outlined in the utilities portion of Attachment 3 (paragraph A3.36.1.4.). 
3.8.2.  When the operational situation does not allow a central power plant, then the base camp will
use distributed generators of sufficient capacity to support peak electrical demand loads in accordance
with component requirements. Backup generators should be installed within the base camp. The
placement, types and numbers will be dependent upon the operational situation. 
3.8.3.  Considerations for Electrical Grid/Load Planning. In the planning phase for the base camp elec-
trical grid, the electrical load for the following numbers and types of equipment must be calculated to
ensure an adequate electrical power supply/grid is constructed: 
3.8.3.1.  Environmental Control Units (Heating/Air Conditioning). 
3.8.3.2.  Communications and Automation Equipmen t. Communications equipment, computers
and airfield control measures are critical for electrical load calculation. Ensure planning encom-
passes charging requirements for battery operated computers and computer base equipment. 
3.8.3.3.  Dining Facility Electrical Equipment. Refer to theater/base Services planner for detailed
load information. 
3.8.3.4.  Billeting. Deployed AF personnel carry a great deal of electronic equipment not origi-
nally planned for under the BEAR deployment concept. It is common for senior enlisted personnel
and officers to deploy with pers onal laptops and other electronic equipment. Ensure these are
taken into consideration when outlining electric al requirements. During upgrades, it has become
common practice to include small refrigerators, television, VCR/DVD players, game consoles and
48
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
computers even in expeditionary tent city environments. The CE planner must be prepared for this
level of electrical load as soon as resources and mission effectiveness allow. 
3.8.4.  Maintenance Facilities. 
3.8.5.  Force Protection Measures (Exterior Lighting/Electrified Fencing). 
3.8.6.  Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Activity Devices and Lighting. Tent cities normally
have a central MWR tent that is comprised of television/theater equipment, gaming consoles,
increased computer equipment and other functions. Coordination with the theater/base theater planner
will enable the CE planner to ad equately cover the electrical needs and incremental growth of these
facilities during base upgrades. 
3.8.7.  Civilian Contract Power. Depending on the operational situation, civilian contracts can be used
to procure, operate and maintain electrical power as the base camp passes beyond the Expeditionary
and Initial phases of development. 
3.9.  Environmental Control (Heating/Air Conditioning). As the base camp matu res, the responsible
component will provide environmental control units to supported facilities/units based on operational and
environmental needs. The type, method and standard of environmental control will be determined by the
following criteria: 
3.9.1.  Operational situation. 
3.9.2.  Climate. During OEF numerous northern expeditionary bases in the theater of operation were
delivered pallets of ECUS in the late fall months that were unable to produce the heating required
(standard Harvest ECUs utilized a heat strip that was only functional to 25 degrees Fahrenheit) while
more southern bases went without, even though the daily temperatures were still exceeding 90 degrees
Fahrenheit. The CE planner must understand the cap abilities and limitations of equipment requested
to ensure our limited assets are sourced for the proper location. 
3.9.3.  Type/function of facility/base camp. 
3.9.4.  Maturity of facility/base camp. Unless extreme climactic conditions or equipment requirements
arise, it does not make sense to  waste limited airlift to deploy envi ronmental control units to Initial
Standard expeditionary bases (<90 days). 
3.9.5.  Base camps will utili ze existing installed environmental control systems if economically and
environmentally feasible. 
3.9.6.  The following priority list fo r deployment of environmental control units is provided to assist
CE planners in doling out these assets. This list serves as a guideline for both theater planners execut-
ing dozens of beddowns or the ba se planner prioritizing on ground  assets for installation. ECUs
should be installed in the following priority: 
3.9.6.1.  Command/Control/Communications and Automation facilities. 
3.9.6.2.  Medical facilities. 
3.9.6.3.  Billeting. 
3.9.6.4.  Dining facilities. 
3.9.6.5.  Dog kennels.

3.9.6.6.  MWR facilities. 
3.10.  Potable Water Recommendations.  
3.10.1.  Base Engineers should tie into local municipalities where it is economically feasible, and con-
ditions meet health and force pr otection standards. The installation of a water purification station
should be considered during the initial planning for the base camp and be part of the start up costs for
the base camp. 
3.10.2.  Installation of wells for pot able water is recommended. A minimum of two wells per camp,
one primary and one back up, within the boundaries of the base camp are recommended. Planning will
include the drilling of all wells at the same time to reduce mobilization costs. If economically feasible,
plan and install water storage distribution systems. Additional wells may be drilled within the base
camp boundaries, if the situation allows, if additional capacity is required. 
3.10.3.  Well-drilling should be contracted through civilian markets where it is economically feasible
and conditions meet force protec tion requirements. RED HORSE units or Army Combat Engineers
have well-drilling capabilities that will need to be requested, sourced and prioritized through the the-
ater engineering planning function. 
3.10.4.  Transported or bottled water should be used only during the early stages of a contingency
operation and should be used as a long-term potab le water source only if no alternate sources are
available. One major lesson learne d by planners is that bottled water places a huge burden on the
logistics procurement and theater airlift planners. CE planners need to be aware that the decision to
utilize bottled water will result in the loss of daily airlift for other equipment and resources if local
suppliers cannot be located and certified to US standards. 
3.11.  Waste Treatment Plant. The initial assessment for a base camp should plan for wastewater treat-
ment based on a minimum of 110% projected size of the camp to include coalition forces and local nation-
als. Coordinate with local contracting and environmental offices to determine if connection to a municipal
wastewater treatment plant is economically feasible and environmentally sound. Containerized wastewa-
ter treatment plants are available through civilian contracts and should be considered when appropriate
and connection to municipal plants is not allowed. Expeditionary ba ses in Northern Iraq were able to
source and install a containerized wastewater treatment for under $700,000 in 60 days. 
3.12.  Personnel Support. Upgrade personnel support facilities to increase support services and provide
a safer working environment. The recommended levels of support (as listed in Attachment 3, Base Camp
Development Matrix) are to apply to all base camps. The level of personnel support will evolve as the
base camp matures and operational requirements change. 
3.12.1.  Dining Facilities. The dining facility may change as the base matures. The long term dining
facility will have electric lighting, environmental control units as operationally feasible and adequate
electrical connections. If civilian contractors are used, establish an occupational medicine program for
health screening. Ensure that local national ki tchen staff is provided adequate space for cleaning,
latrine and changing areas. 
3.12.2.  Each base camp will have a nondenominationa l religious support facility, sized according to
the base population. The structure, as operationally feasible, will have electrical lighting, environmen-
tal control units and fixed electrical connections. The responsible base commander will provide ade-
50
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
quate office space for chaplains to conduct privileged communications, adequate storage space and
side areas for private devotions. Coordination with  theater/base chaplain planner will further define
their requirement. 
3.12.3.  Fire Protection. The responsible component commander will provide Fire and Emergency
Response Services IAW DODI 6055.6 and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 403, Stan-
dard for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Services at Airports. 
3.13.  Planned Upgrades. The basic requirement to support mission full operational capability (FOC)
within a set timeline determines  the AEF facility beddown timeli nes. Meeting the FOC and beddown
timelines (as well as providing an acceptable level of force protection, readiness capabilities, fire protec-
tion and critical support facilities) drives TPFDD re-engineering and UTC restructuring. AEF bare base
support must be lighter, leaner and faster. The following matrix is provided to assist CE and contingency
airbase planners to provide initial requirements for minimum operations. Upgrades from initial to tempo-
rary standards should be planned and implemented as soon as mission and resources allow. 
3.14.  Manpower Utilization and Task Assignment. CE planners need to review anticipated deploy-
ment duration and mission requirements to determine the best utiliz ation of limited active duty, AFRES
and ANG civil engineer personnel to ensure that the areas where they are deployed and utilized are appro-
priate for blue suit operations. Table 3.5. lists some standard contingency tasks and provides general guid-
ance for potential task execution resources to limit deployed man-days for CE personnel.

3.16.  Army Force Provider Resources. Force Provider is the Army’s base camp support system, similar
to the Air Force BEAR system. Force Provider was de veloped in response to lessons learned from the
1991 Gulf War. During Operation Desert Storm the Army realized that its base beddown and operating
support facilities contained only rudimentary messing and hygiene facilities and actually hampered mis-
sion accomplishment and troop morale. 
Figure 3.4.  US Army Force Provider Set. 
3.16.1.  The Force Provider (FP) mission is to give frontline soldiers a respite from the rigors of duty.
Each Force Provider Company consists of six platoons which can support 550 soldiers separately.
Combining all six modules allows support for 3,300 soldiers. The modules can operate as stand-alone
beddown or as a modular and scalable tent city to  support as large a deployment as assets are avail-
able. Each 550+ module provides the following:

BARE BASE UTILITIES DEVELOPMENT 
4.1.  Overview:  The provision of water, electricity and removal and treatment of wastewater are critical
to the success of deployed military operations and AF CE mission requirements. This chapter will outline
some general utility issues. Greater detail on planning and installing deployed utility systems is outlined
in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5 and AFH 10-222, Volume 1. 
4.2.  Problems and Solutions. Recent bare base operations during OAF, OEF and OIF have highlighted
a number of utility limitations and challenges faced by deployed expeditionary engineering units. Theater
and unit level engineer planners and leadership can alleviate many of these problems by understanding the
cause and effects of these limitations. 
Figure 4.1.  Typical BEAR Utility Assets. 
4.3.  Potable Water. During Operations Southern and Northe rn Watch deployed USAF personnel and
base camp operations used bottled water as the primary source of potable water for personal consumption.
This evolution from production-based potable water supplies resulted from very liberal assistance-in-kind
(AIK) agreements between the Gulf States of Kuwait, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Air Force personnel
operating within the theater. In these agreements, the host nation agreed to supply numerous consumable
resources to include potable water at no char ge to the US government. As personnel rotated through the
CENTAF AOR, bottled water became  part of the understood deploya ble concept of operations. This
dependency upon bottled water caused a number of problems during OEF and OIF. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
59
4.3.1.  Water supply for the personnel at an OEF base in Afghanistan was provided by bottled water
flown in from central supply points in Qata r and Kuwait. Two months into the mission with over
1,000 personnel on the ground, the CE water shop was treating 15,000 gallons of city water per day.
The base utilized the treated water for laundry, dining, cleaning and hygiene requirements but would
not utilize it for personal consumption. The treated city water was rated safe by the base Bioenviron-
mental Engineer yet the base was still flying in roughly 10,000 bottles of water per day to support base
personnel. This consumed critical airflow for other mission assets since water was always prioritized
at the top position for intra-theater airlift. 
4.3.2.  While experiencing shortfalls in engineering heavy equipment, maintenance supplies and qual-
ity of life improvements, the base was losing approximately two C-130 flights per day to the mindset
that AF personnel must drink bottled water. Since this mindset was prevalent at over 17 expeditionary
bases in the AOR it had a significant effect on available airlift. Mission requirements eventually led to
many bases, such as Bagram, Kanda har, and Jacobabad to switch over to ROWPU treated water for
consumption when the base population surged beyond the AF’s ability to purchase, marshal and ship
enough bottled water to support base populations in remote areas. 
4.3.3.  Theater engineering planners need to be ready to advocate for the judicious use of bottled water
for initial operations and conversion to other sources as quickly as possible to increase overall mission
effectiveness. 
4.4.  Latrine/Sanitation Facilities. Poor sanitation and hygiene has significantly impacted military cam-
paigns throughout history. Figure 4.4 shows examples of latrine facilities used by Air Force expeditionary
forces during the OAF, OEF and OIF. Many of the austere and initial standard facilities were utilized for
extended periods while theater level planners attempted to source and transport Harvest Falcon or Force
Provider assets to alleviate conditions that did not meet minimum AF operating and hygiene standards. 
Figure 4.2.  Expeditionary Latrines during Contingency Operations. 
4.4.1.  In this day and age of modern technology, airlift and continued improvements in bare base asset
technologies, AF expeditionary engineers can still expect to be faced with a wide-range of sanitation
and latrine options while bedding down US and coalition troops. Numerous bare base beddowns dur-
ing OAF, OEF and OIF required USAF engineers to construct field expedient latrines, urine trenches,
latrines with burnout pots and other creative solutions to handle a very real sanitation problem. 
60
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
4.4.1.1.  Base engineers need to ensure that they focus on completing basic expedient latrine and
sanitation construction techniques during field exercises, and ensure personnel understand the
importance of planning for and marking the location of waste collection areas, slit trench locations
and other waste disposal areas to ensure future excavation does not expose these areas. 
4.4.1.2.  Shower Facilities. Although very important to hygiene,  sanitation and quality of life,
shower facilities do not represent the critical requirement that latrines do. Recent operations have
shown that shower/shave kits will be bumped by higher priority assets for daily intra-theater air-
lift. Deploying AF engineers should plan for the requirement to construct a field expedient shower
facility with limited Class IV material available on the local market. If showers are a high priority
of your deploying team, the engineers need to pack for it. 
4.4.2.  Deployed units often experienced host nation (HN) infrastructure limitations when attempting
to expand base facilities for new missions and the associated infrastructure required: sewage treatment
and gray water disposal, solid waste management programs. These types of limitations are greatly
improved where the US and HN force have created a favorable political climate that creates opportu-
nities for service contracts, land leases and utility supplies. The CE planner must take local economy,
political relations and other outside influences into consideration when trying to solve the problem.
Normal deployment systems/methods for sewage treatment and waste disposal may not be possible
when an existing airfield is used for an AEF deployment. Surrounding populations and structures may
simply prevent some expansions and existing utility systems may already be overtaxed or incapable of
handling the additional load from a small military city dropping in on their doorstep. 
4.4.3.  Deployment planning may have to consider use of purchased or leased package treatments sys-
tems, construction of intermediate holding tanks to allow storage of sewage and wastewater for
removal to a more remote treatment  site and construction, repairs and upgrades to an existing utility
system before tying into it. AF CAP (or other contract augmentation programs) may be required to
provide resources and labor or RED HORSE may be required to construct large tanks or bury pipe-
lines. 
4.5.  Electrical Development: Development of electrical requirements, upgrades and planning factors
can be found in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5. 
4.6.  Conclusion. Air Force engineers, planners and deployed personnel need to address sanitation and
hygiene requirements early in the planning and beddown process. Silver Flag and CE training focuses on
the importance of this, yet we often still fall short in real world deployments. Historically during deploy-
ments, more personnel require medical assistance due to sanitation related illnesses than due to combat
injury.

Chapter 5   
SECURITY AND FORCE PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT 
5.1.  Overview. Security and protection of Air Force assets in an expeditionary location is of critical
importance to all organizations on the base. Although the Security Forces Commander operates the base
Force Protection plan, it cannot be a ccomplished without active participation of CE planners and crafts-
men. AEF planners should have mo re information/intelligence on location threats when planning for
deployments to austere locations when compared to s tandard bare bases. Austere, forward locations are
usually much closer to battle areas or areas of heightened terrorist threat. Units that deploy will have much
more to consider when they arrive on station and some of  their initial actions may include verifying the
threat situation rather than starting site layout. Consider the following subjects when you deploy to higher
threat areas. 
Figure 5.1.  Security Forces Providing Perimeter Security. 
5.2.  Force Protection Planning. For civil engineers, force protection roles and responsibilities have var-
ied greatly since 1950. 
5.2.1.  During the Cold War, the Air Force CONOPS was to operate from established main operating
bases with hardened shelters and facilities, as we ll as numerous buildings with chemical overprotec-
tion. Army personnel surrounded these bases for ground defense and air defense with Patriot batteries.
Depending on the theater, the threat ranged from attack by enemy special operations forces and sabo-
teurs, larges scale air and ground attac ks and conventional and chemical missile and rocket a ttacks.
Security force protection ranged from fortified bunkers, robust perimeter security and alarmed facility
and base access. 
5.2.2.  During Operation Desert Storm the Air Force was able to activate some bases with Royal Saudi
Air Force (RSAF) hardened facilities and chemi cal protection. The majority of Air Force operations
were conducted from bare base, expeditionary airfields with Harvest Falcon systems or temporary
shelters, which were not chemically protected. Ar my forces and resources were still utilized to pro-
vide ground defense and anti-aircraft/anti-missile air defenses for AF bases. Rudimentary facility
hardening was accomplished with sa ndbags, concrete barriers and various constructed revetments.
Due to air and naval superiority, the major threat became chemical and biological attacks by missiles
and terrorists, as well as conventional attacks by terrorists. Enemy special force units and teams were
62
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
still a threat, but they had limited long-range capability to attack most bare bases. AF Security Forces
personnel created force protection plans based on multiple fighting positions, roving patrols and
mobile alarm systems. Chemical, biological and radiological detection was still relatively rudimentary
utilizing passive monitoring systems (M-8/M-9 tape) and often fell to Re adiness teams that were
ill-equipped, lacked the adequate situation intelligence and resources to adequately protect in what
could have been a significantly contaminated environment. 
Figure 5.2.  PSAB Airbase (Before and After Buildup). 
5.2.3.  Recent AEF deployments have relied on Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon assets, along with
Army Force Provider assets. Revetments have ranged from expedient sandbag to Concertainer sys-
tems. Weapon threats tend to be  grenades, mortars, mines, rockets and missiles; shoulder fired
anti-aircraft missiles and small ca nnons. While the threat is usually from explosives, there is the
chance that chemical or biological agents could be used in war heads or even in ground dispersal
devices. Force protection is a major concern when there is a high probability of terrorist, saboteur, or
insurgent attacks, especially when the planned b are base airfield is at an existing commercial airport
near a town. When airfields are surrounded by populated areas, it forces in- and outbound aircraft to
fly over towns and there is a greater threat of a successful shoot down of coalition aircraft. 
5.2.3.1.  Force protection plans for expeditionary airbases (EAB) of this type should consider the
use of defensive fighting positions, roving patrols, remote area detection alarms and other mea-
sures to secure the flightline and the surrounding area to the greatest extent possible. 
5.2.3.2.  Large frame aircraft used for troop rotation and resupply are easier and more inviting tar-
gets to enemy forces and their protection places an even greater strain on our security forces per-
sonnel. Fighting positions must be used along with portable alarm systems and detection fields.
Protective measures and patrols must be extended as far past the runway clear zones as possible to
prevent targeting of the slower, heavier aircraft on approach and take off. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
63
Figure 5.3.  Expeditionary Airbase in Afghanistan. 
5.2.4.  Civil Engineer and Security Force pla nners must coordinate force protection requirements,
help establish protection zones, reinforce fighting positions, clear or establish obstacles and harden
the perimeter in some locations to ensure maximum utilization of resources. Beddown and planning
should take into account the force protection needs at their inception to prevent problems during exe-
cution. It may be necessary to construct berms and revetments around critical assets and to bury or
cover utilities. 
5.2.5.  AEF deployments for OEF e xperienced planned and unplanned growth, which required addi-
tional land and resources. Every change that increases the base footprint usually requires changes and
extensions to force protection measures. Some areas with exposed fuel transfer pipelines may have to
be buried or placed between  berms or shallow trench es to provide additional protection. The same
holds true for utility lines. While electrical cables should normally be buried, if host nations prohibit
burying or the ground surface is solid rock, then you should plan to berm and cover or bring in soil and
cover these utilities (except at road crossings where these utilities should always be buried). 
5.2.6.  When there is a higher risk of terrorist attacks or sabotage , protection of water transfer lines
becomes a concern. In the past, a major concern related to chemical attacks has been the introduction
of agents into a municipal water supply used by de ployed forces. However, there is also a threat to
water produced by ROWPUs and stored in tanks. Du e to the ready availability of waterline hot-tap-
ping tools, PVC or soft/ductile water transfer pipes can be tapped under pressure within minutes. Then
a chemical poison or bi ological agent could be introduced with a hand pump. Provide planning
assumptions for protective measures such as roving patrols and/or burying the lines, especially for any
areas that are not readily observable. 
5.2.7.  To meet the threat of an airborne chemical attack, planning should also consider whether addi-
tional areas of the base will have to be cleared to create saf e areas for contamination control areas
(CCA). Planners should consider possible approach/departure routes for the base and CCAs based on
the topography and prevailing winds. Planners should understand that open areas, which can be used
as potential CCAs, may f urther limit the available la nd on a base. If this is the case, notify theater
64
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
planners that contingency real estate support teams (CREST) or theater contracting officers may have
to take action to lease additional land prior to deployment. 
5.3.  Classification of Threats. CE planners need to be able to characterize and define the various threats
faced in an expeditionary location to greater partner with the force protection planning group at both the
theater and base level. The Air Force has developed a matrix to define the varying levels and threats posed
to an expeditionary airbase (Table 5.1. and Table 5.2.). Greater detail on these and other potential NBCC
threats may be found in AFMAN 10-2602 Chapter 2, Sections 2-4 through 2-12. 
Table 5.1.  EAF Airbase Threat Matrix. 
Table 5.2.  Airbase Defense Threat Levels. 
5.3.1.  Low-intensity ground threats include utilization of gueri lla style tactics by conventional or
non-conventional military forces (terrorists, insurgents or military) to pene trate base perimeters and
disrupt operations or cause loss of AF personnel or resources. The best defense against a low intensity
ground threat is utilization of a large and mobile security forces presence to provide monitoring of the
base perimeter and controlling base access. Through a number of AF Battle Lab initiatives, the AF has

developed a number of electronic upgrades to equip the roving patr ols and augment perimeter secu-
rity. These initiatives include, bu t are not limited to, th e Tactical Automated Surveillance System,
night vision technology, perimeter fence movement detectors, perimeter cameras with central control
and monitoring, and lighter armored vehicles and body armor. The theater and base SF Force Protec-
tion Cell will be able to provide additional information to the CE planner regarding equipment in use
and required CE support of construction and infrastructure to support FP initiatives. 
Figure 5.4.  Infrared Sensor Security System Installed on Base Perimeter. 
5.3.2.  Medium-intensity ground threat includes the utilization of enemy Special Operations Forces
(SOF), paramilitary, specialized terrorist organizations that attempt base penetrations and operations
disruption through direct attack or standoff weaponry (mortars, rockets, rocket propelled grenades)
launched from outside the base perimeter. This type of threat is very difficult to defend against since
the primary methodology is to attack from beyond the perimeter fence where US forces may or may
not have authority to engage. Current procedures require the base to work closely with host nation
security and military agencies to provide beyond-the-fence surveillance and around the base (1,200
foot desired) standoff, clear zone to minimize the impact of standoff weapons. CE personnel may be
called upon to erect counter-mobility berms, install concrete barriers and assist with the construction
of over watch positions and towers. The AF Force Protection Battle Lab is looking into the potential
of fielding other assets to enable the SF personnel to better counter this threat. Contact you base force
protection cell for information. 
66
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
Figure 5.5.  Surveillance from Over Watch Tower. 
5.3.3.  High-intensity ground threats are large scale, organized terrorist or enemy military forces (nor-
mally brigade size or larger) attacks on an airbase. While low and medium intensity ground threats are
the responsibility of the assigned base personnel, high-intensity threats will normally require the
deployment of additional forces to counter the threat. Baghdad International Airport during Operation
Iraqi Freedom was a high-intensity threat area that evolved into a medium threat area. The AF was
collocated with an Army brigade to provide greater security and alleviate the threat. 
5.3.4.  Low-intensity air threats are found in slow-moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or suicide
remote controlled aerial bombs (small remote controlled airplanes, rockets etc). When these are paired
with GPS guidance systems, they  become especially lethal. Th ese UAV delivery systems can be
armed with a series of sub-munitions, cluster bombs and conventional weapons, chemical/biological
systems that pose a serious threat to successful mission and airbase operations. Base planners should
strive to increase intelligence collection and coordination, SF interaction with air traffic control (host
nation and coalition). Base CE and SF need to have an adequate bunker and emergency alarm plan to
counter the potential impact of this type of weaponry. 
5.3.5.  Medium-intensity air threat covers the realm of standard military or terrorist aerial bombing
operations. In this type of environment, base CE and SF need to have an adequate bunker and emer-
gency alarm plan to counter the potential impact of this type of  attack. Current AF doctrine requires
the AF to establish and maintain theater air superiority to counter this level of threat. 
5.3.6.  High-intensity air threat en compasses theater ballistic missiles (SCUDS, intermediate range
ballistic missiles, etc.). The majority of enemies who will possess this technology will be severely
hampered by poor guidance and limited stocks. The base should be prepared to defend against and
survive lucky hits of conventional or NBC warheads. The base CE a nd SF need to have an adequate
bunker and emergency reaction plan to counter the potential impact of this threat. 
5.3.7.  Low-intensity NBC threats encompass the potential of chemical or biological contamination of
base water and food suppli es in an effort to sicken or kill the base population and disrupt mission
operation. Current AF operations utilize vaccinations, antibiotics, preventative health maintenance to
counter the effects of contamination. Bases should maintain an emergency supply of bottled water and
meals-ready-to-eat (MREs) as a backup in the event of contamination. Base food and water stocks can
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
67
be resupplied within a matter of days so stockpiles do not need to be extensive. Base CE water produc-
tion specialists and Biomedical Engineering personnel are responsible for continual testing of the base
water source. 
5.3.8.  Medium-intensity NBC threats are defined as the localized release of NBC warfare agents with
the intent to immobilize, destroy or degrade US operations. Localized release means the attack con-
taminates parts of a base but falls short of af fecting the entire airbase, resulting in the current
split-mission oriented personal protection (MOPP) concept of operations at AF bases worldwide. As
the primary resource for readiness reporting the CE planners must relay heavily on the expertise and
experience found in the CE Readin ess Flights to alleviate this th reat. Intelligence, remote sensors,
emergency response planning and adequate personnel bunkers will assist in minimizing the impact of
this threat. 
5.3.9.  High-intensity NBC threats are defined as an att ack that causes base wide contamination by
NBC agents. As the primary resource for readines s reporting the CE planners must relay heavily on
the expertise and experience found in the CE Readin ess Flights to alleviate this threat. I ntelligence,
remote sensors, emergency response planning and adequate personnel bunkers will assist in minimiz-
ing the impact of this threat. 
5.3.10.  Low-intensity command and control/intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C2ISR)
threats are physical attacks on information, C2 and communications systems infrastructure. To defend
against this, CE, Communications and SF planners need to ensure that key nodes, distribution centers
and relays are installed in the most secure method available. Host nation coordination may be required
for underground installation. 
5.3.11.  Medium-intensity C2ISR threats are defined as attacks to deny expeditionary forces access to
reach back data and planning capabilities, connectivity to higher headquarters, intelligence organiza-
tions, surveillance, and hacking of US government computer systems by insurgent forces. 
5.3.12.  High-intensity C2ISR threats are defined as the disruption or  destruction of C2ISR systems
through the utilization of electrical or radio waves. 
5.4.  Security Forces Base Defense CONOPS. Engineers need to understand the defensive CONOPS of
the AF Security Forces to  better support physical security requirements. The primary item for AF CE
planners to understand is that AF SF CONOPS dictate that the AF will be responsible for the tactical area
of responsibility (TAOR) and perimeter fence in, while security of the area outside of the base will fall to
other agencies. The following postures are included in AFPD 31-3, Air Base Defense. 
5.4.1.  During periods of low or mid-level threats (Levels I, II and III), airbase defense forces are pri-
marily responsible for protecting the force from attackers attempting close attack by penetrating
forces and from standoff attack within the TAOR. The TAOR is the area, which the defense force
commander can control through organic heavy/light weapons fire. The Air Force component will
ensure adequate support is available from the othe r joint components, host nation, coalition, allied
forces, and civilian authorities to meet surveillance and denial needs, such as for the stand-of f threat
beyond the capabilities of the Air Force. 
5.4.2.  During periods of high-level threat (Level III), airbase defense forces rely on a tactical combat
force (TCF) comprised of other US service components, allied, coalition, or host-nation forces to
ensure the survivability of airbases. 
68
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
5.4.3.  Outside the airbase TAOR, US Army, USMC, host nation military forces, or civilian law
enforcement agencies will have responsibility for security requirements. 
5.4.4.  US, host-nation, coalition, and civilian law enforcement/security forces will be incorporated
into airbase defense planning and operations to the fullest extent possible. 
5.5.  Force Protection and Safety. Antiterrorism force protection and p hysical security in the expedi-
tionary environment present unique challenges to planners, engineers and security forces. The threat type,
severity, and desired level of protection are the primary considerations when selecting AT/FP and physical
security measures. These considerations will be used to identify vulnerabilities, reduction measures, and
the siting of facilities. In the expeditionary envi ronment, important security planning factors include:
availability of existing facilities, types of structures, existing natural or man-made features, types and
quantity of indigenous construction materials, available real estate, and othe r base infrastructure.
Pre-existing buildings will be renovated to meet DOD, AF , and CFACC force protection and security
standards. These standards will provide guidance to design strategies for mitigating the effects of specific
aggressor tactics, defined levels of protection, and effects on building costs of applying those measures.
Some specific force protection measures are as follows. 
5.5.1.  Perimeter. Chain link or concertina fences will be employed on the camp perimeter. Whenever
possible, berms and sniper screens will be used to bloc k direct visual access from outside the base
perimeter. Lighted gravel perimeter roads should be installed insi de the perimeter berm. Surveys to
assess alternate access routes should be completed with focus on culverts underneath the perimeter
fence. Culverts should be caged, or otherwise blocked to prevent personnel entry. 
5.5.2.  Gates. Main gates with covered inspection ar eas are authorized if required by the operational
situation. Barriers will be built to enable the blockage of large vehicles. Gate Guard Shacks should be
equipped with lighting and environmental control units. Tilt bar and swing gates are authorized. Place
weapons clearing barrels inside the gates. 
5.5.3.  Primary Gathering Facilities.  Construct barriers to minimiz e car bomb threats. Use HESCO
bastions, Jersey barriers, or other methods capable of stopping a car or truck. Fence the air condition-
ing intakes to reduce the terrorist threat of introducing gas into duct systems. 
5.5.4.  Water Sources. Water plants, wells, storage tanks, and bladders will be  fenced if a threat to
these facilities exists. 
5.6.  Minimum Force Protection Design Standards. The most cost-effective solution for mitigating the
effects of an attack is generally to provide distance between facilities and any explosions that might occur.
Unified Facilities Criteria 4-010-01 provides planning standards for expeditionary and temporary struc-
tures, including minimum antiterrorism standards for expeditionary and temporary structures. As is the
case for fixed facilities, the type and severity of the threat along with the desired level of protection will
be the primary considerations in the selection of the anti-terrorism force protection and physical security
measures. These considerations will affect decisions on various issues such as the types of vulnerability
reduction measures and the physical layout of facilities, facility groups and infrastructure. Important fac-
tors in planning security measures  in the expeditionary environment include the availability of existing
facilities, the type of structures in which people live and work, existing natura l or man-made features,
type and quantity of indigenous construction materials,  available real estate an d layout of utilities and
other base infrastructure. The standards in UFC 4-010-01 fo r minimum standoff distances apply to all

new and existing expeditionary and temporary structures and is more in depth and has precedence over
guidance outlined in this pamphlet. 
5.6.1.  Facility Access. 
5.6.1.1.  Select sites away from public roads or other uncontrolled areas. 
5.6.1.2.  Maximize use of natural or  man-made features to obscu re vision from potential threat
vantage points. 
5.6.1.3.  Limit vehicle approach speeds. 
5.6.1.4.  Minimize vehicle access points. 
5.6.1.5.  Provide an entry control point with a well defined holding area for unauthorized vehicles
and vehicles being searched. The holding area should be outside of prescribed minimum standoff
distance. 
5.6.1.6.  Separate functional areas requiring frequent vehicle access (e.g., kitchens, industrial
areas, retail areas, refuse collection points) from billeting areas. 
5.6.2.  Site Characteristics. 
5.6.2.1.  Maintain good housekeeping by keeping areas within 30 feet of shelters or structures free
of items other than those items that are part of the infrastructure. 
5.6.2.2.  When possible, position exterior doors so they cannot be easily targeted from the installa-
tion perimeter or uncontrolled vantage points. 
5.6.3.  Facility Standoff/Separation. Standoff distances are defined as the distance maintained between
a building or portion thereof and the potential location for an explosive detonation. Standoff distances
are based on the assumption that a controlled perimeter will create an opportunity to detect bombs and
explosives before they enter the controlled perimeter. To make them effective planners must clearly
delineate the installation perimeter. This includes fencing, concertina wire, barricades, counter-mobil-
ity barriers, ditches, police tape, or warning signs. The following table and figure highlight and illus-
trate the minimum antiterrorism standards for expeditionary and temporary structures in Annex D of
UFC 4-010-01.

5.7.1.  Power Generation and Distribution. Wood or chain link fence will be installed around all gen-
erator, transformer and consolidated generator st ation locations. Enclosing generators in wooden
buildings is not authorized. 
5.7.2.  Perimeter. Fences, either chain link or con certina, are authorized around the camp perimeter.
Berms and sniper screens are authorized to bloc k vision. Perimeter lights are authorized. A gravel
perimeter road is authorized inside the berm. Culverts underneath the perimeter fence will be caged to
prevent persons from crawling through. 
5.7.3.  Gates. Covered inspection areas on the main gates are authorized as required by weather con-
ditions. Gates will have lighted, heated, guard shacks. Tilt bar and swing gates are authorized. Locate
clearing barrels inside the gates. 
5.7.4.  Clearing Barrels. Clearing barrels will be installed at all access control points and outside the
entrances to arms and ammunition storage areas, medical and dinning facilities. 
5.7.5.  Walkways and decks. Pressure treated, rot-resistant lumber is the standard. If not available, or
cost prohibitive, consider using composite decking material for co nstructing walkways and decks.
Untreated wood can be used if primed and painted. Paint any wo oden walkways with sand paint or
other non-slip materials to reduce the chance of slipping, particularly in climates with snow and ice or
extended rainy periods. Provide lighting wherever steps cannot be seen at night. 
5.7.6.  Buried utilities. The BCE will maintain a database of all buried utilities. No job will be closed
out until new underground utilities have been pr operly documented. No work will commence on a
project until a dig permit has been obtained. Digging permits should also be coordinated for commu-
nication line clearance. Buried utilities will have caution tape at least one foot above the utility lines.
Buried electrical lines will have signs posted at every turn in the line and wherever else needed by the
terrain. 
5.7.7.  Bunkers. Only bunker designs approved by th e Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and
Development Center will be constr ucted. Sand bag bunkers will have the sand bags protected from
solar radiation and the wooden core protected from rot. Design factor is 110% of camp population for
bunkers and fighting positions. No rmal planning factor is that 50%  of the population will be on the
perimeter, with 50 % in bunkers. 
5.7.8.  Guard Towers. Guard towers will be placed so every tower is visible to the immediate towers
on the right and left so there is no dead space on the perimeter. Towers will have heat and light. Tow-
ers will be hardened against small arms and mortar fire. 
5.7.9.  Constructed fighting positions. Overhead cover design on fighting positions must be approved
by the task force engineer. Fighting positions must be inspected regularly for deterioration. A digging
permit must be coordinated before any construction begins. 
5.7.10.  Theaters and similar multipurpose facilities. These facilities will have a barrier to minimize a
car bomb threat. Barrier can be a berm, HESCO bastions, Jersey barriers, or other method capable of
stopping a car or truck. Air induction units and other vents will be screened or fenced to reduce terror-
ist threat of gas introduced into the duct systems. 
5.7.11.  Water Plant. Water plants, wells, storage tanks and bladders will be fenced. 
5.8.  Siren Warning System (Giant Voice). Force Protection planning should include the installation of
a dual tone warning system that supports voice and tone to alert personnel to local hazards and incidents.
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006

The system should be sited to provide clear audible coverage of main work sites and billeting cantonment
areas. 
5.9.  Mines, Improvised Explosive Devices and Unexploded Ordnance. The strength and capabilities
of the US military make it an unstoppable force in the face of conventional symmetrical warfare. To bal-
ance the battlefield, the enemy has resorted to asymmetrical warfare tactics of small guerilla units armed
with unconventional weaponry. Worldwide attacks over the last decade highlight this: suicide bombers in
market squares, roadside daisy chain explosives along the supply routes in Iraq, booby-trapped facilities
in Afghanistan, and airliners used  as bombs during the September 1 1th attacks against New York and
Washington DC. The military planner and bare base beddown engineer mu st be constantly aware of the
threat of passive and active unconventional weapons. During the six months after cessation of major mil-
itary actions during OIF, more US military personnel were killed by unconventional weapons and guerilla
insurgents than were lost during direct combat actions against the Iraqi Army. 
5.9.1.  A common threat at most expeditionary beddown and airfield sites is the presence of anti-per-
sonnel explosive devices dispersed through enem y forces, insurgent groups or expended coalition
unexploded ordnance. This results in the common EOD mantra to deployed personnel to ST AY ON
THE CONRETE. EOD personnel are essential for the clearing, de-mining and safing of a potential
beddown area. This is particularly critical during the planning and open the base module. If EOD has
not cleared the area, it doesn’t matter how much equipment you have on site, you cannot initiate bed-
down erection. Theater level CE planners must advocate at the planning meetings to ensure that EOD
is present on the survey ADVON team and if required in the initial cadre of personnel arriving to the
site. The new Airborne Engineer CONOPS incorporates this requirement into its SOP for airfield sur-
veys. During OAF, coalition EOD personnel provided a myriad of sa fing and clearing operations. A
matrix of available methodologies and their advantages and disadvantages is found in Table 5.4.. This
is to serve only as a general information sheet fo r engineer planners. All planning efforts should
include the theater or deploying EOD commander or planner. Air Force engineers must remember that
EOD actions may be completed by other than Air Force personnel.

Table 5.4.  Neutralization and Detection Methods for UXOs. 
5.9.2.  During OAF, Army Combat Engineering Battalions had to complete extensive explosive clear-
ing operations prior to beddown delaying the es tablishment of stationary beddown operations. At
many locations in Yugoslavia and the Balkans, the Army is still clearing portions of the airfields that
they have been operating on for over 8 years. Smal l insurgent countries have seen a proliferation of
counter-personnel mining operations in an attempt to quell civilian uprisings and keep dictatorial gov-
ernments in power. In every area of the Middle East, Far East, African and Balkans theater of opera-
tions, military personnel will be faced with the task of identifying the counter-personnel mine threat,
presence and remediation of the threat. Conservative estimates identify over one billion counter-per-
sonnel mines currently deployed throughout the world. Most in areas where location maps no longer
exist.

5.9.3.  The construction of an improvised explosive device (IED) is simple: modify military ordnance,
initiator/fuse, some plastic explosives and an i ndividual to trigger the explosion. This simplicity
makes it very difficult to eliminate the IED threat.

1 – Based on the maximum amount of material that could reasonably fit into a container or vehicle. Variations possible. 
2 – Governed by the ability of an unreinforced building to withstand severe damage or collapse. 
3 – Governed by greater of fragment throw distance or glass breakage/falling glass hazard distance. Distances can be reduced 
for personnel wearing ballistic protection. Note that pipe bomb, suicide belt/vest, and briefcase/suitcase bomb are assumed to 
have a fragmentation characteristic that requires greater standoff distances than equal amounts of explosives in a vehicle. 
4 – Assuming efficient mixing of the flammable gas with ambient air. 
5 – Determined by U.S. firefighting practices wherein safe distances are approximately 4 times the flame height. Note that an 
LPG tank filled with high explosives would require a significantly greater standoff distance than if it were filled with LPG.

Chapter 6   
FACILITIES UPGRADE, SUSTAINMENT AND MAINTENANCE 
6.1.  Overview. This chapter discusses transitioning from short-term use temporary expeditionary facili-
ties to semi-permanent and permane nt facilities. It also discusses various funding and programming
requirements for beddown construction. 
6.2.  Transition to Temporary Standard, Semi-Permanent and Permanent Facilities. Typically the
basis for transition to temporary standard facilities has relied on the Joint Publication 4-04 requirement
that temporary standard facilities will be adopted when the deployment is expected to last more than 6
months, then temporary standards will increase usage up to 24 months. The realities of overseas deploy-
ment and the support of theaters and areas of responsibility have required basing to exist for more than 24
months, but usually less than 5 years to be considered as a standard for transition to even more permanent
facilities. When a base will become a main base for operations and logistics support in a theater, the like-
lihood is that diplomatic and military agreements will require semi-permanent and permanent facilities to
be constructed. Sometimes this is with conveyance to the host nation as a grant for basing, while in other
cases the facilities may be conveyed to the host nation with the stipulation that the facilities may be used
again in case of contingencies. When this is the case, additional agreements may be required to establish
pre-positioning sites for deployment resources. Depending on the reason for the conflict, the scope of the
work and the length of use, construction may be through O&M or MILCON funding. 
Figure 6.1.  Prince Sultan Airbase – Enduring Presence Construction Standard. 
78
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
6.3.  Normal Transition to Temporary Facilities. Construction and quality of life upgrades should be
programmed and planned as soon as  resources and mission expectations allow. If initial beddown mis-
sions are planned for long term US presence than CE planners should initiate and advocate for semi-per-
manent construction standards as soon  as resources allow. This will free up critical BEAR assets for
utilization in short term expeditionary, FOB and FOL bases. During the maturation of the mission, bases
may be identified for longer operational requirement s therefore requiring the upgrade of the base con-
struction standards. 
6.4.  Funding Transition and Beddown Construction. Engineering planners must be aware of funding
and programming requirements for all levels of expe ditionary and contingency beddown and construc-
tion. Attempts to circumvent these programming and funding requirements usually results in significant
delays and paperwork in gaining the appropriate approvals. Although many of the authorities require up
to 30 days of approval and processing, it is quicker than trying to go around the rules. Further details and
decision flow charts for deciding which authorities are appropriate for your requirements can be found in
JP 4-04, Appendix F, pages F-3 through F-5. 
6.4.1.  Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Funding: The Air Force is authorized to use annual O&M
funds for construction projects less than $750K. This is a peacetime provision that is applicable during
contingencies and emergencies. During combat or designated contingency operations, O&M may be
used under certain circumstances to fund construction projects exceeding these thresholds. The theater
or wing legal office must be consulted prior to expending O&M funding for contingency construction. 
6.4.2.  Title 10, USC, Emergency and Contingency Construction: Title 10 USC contains numerous
broad authorities to fund contingency construction. 
6.4.3.  Section 2803 Emergency Military Construction Authority: Section 2803 authorizes AF leader-
ship to use up to $30M per year of unobligated military construction (MILCON) for projects that can-
not wait for the normal MILCON program submission and approval process. Section 2803 projects
require a 21-day Congressional notification period for members to question the applicability of utiliz-
ing current year funds for the requested project. Planners need to be aware that 2803 funds are current
year MILCON funds currently authorized for another project. If you utilize 2803 funds for a project,
the AF loses a similar project elsewhere to fund the requirement. 
6.4.4.  Section 2804 Contingency Construction Authority: Section 2804 funding authority allows the
Secretary of Defense to designate a specific military construction program line item amount for con-
tingency construction projects that cannot wait for normal MILCON submission and authorization.
Section 2804 funding normally is less than $10M per year and requires a 21-day Congressional noti-
fication period. 
6.4.5.  Section 2805 Unspecified Minor Construction: Section 2805 authorizes the AF (and other ser-
vices) a military construction program line item for unspecified minor construction requirements.
Project funded under this authority cannot ex ceed $1.5M. Projects exceeding $500K require a
21-Congressional Notification period. 
6.4.5.1.  CE construction planners should coordina te with USAF/ILEC to request utilization of
these funds. 
6.4.5.2.  Exercise related construction (ERC) pr ojects complement and enhance the Chairman
Joint Chief of Staff (CJCS) Joint Training Plan Exercise Program. Projects will be developed to
enhance the effectiveness of exercise activities, reduce overall exercise costs, enhance safety and
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
79
improve training of engineer forces. ERC may be accomplished by US troops, combined US-host
nation engineer forces, or by contractor (accomplishment by contractor is the least preferred
option). Where an ERC project is planned in a country eligible for assistance, an HCA construc-
tion project should be planned in conjunction with the ERC project. 
6.4.5.2.1.  ERC is defined as an unspecified minor co nstruction project, outside CONUS, in
support of an in-progress or planned CJ CS exercise that results in a faci lity, or facilities that
remain, in any part after the end of the exercise. 
6.4.5.2.2.  The cost of a single ERC project may not exceed $1,500,000. Each ERC project
must be approved by the Joint Staff and reported to Congress. No construction funds may be
obligated until the appropriate Congressional committees have approved the project or a
21-day waiting period has elapsed from the date of the notification. An ERC project includes
all construction necessary to produce a complete and usable facility. Construction costs can
vary +/- 25% without the requirement to request Joint Staff approval. 
6.4.6.  Section 2808 Construction Author ity in the Event of a Declarat ion of War or National Emer-
gency: Section 2808 authority can only be granted after a Presiden tial declaration of war or national
emergency. Section 2808 allows the Secretary of Defense to ca rry out any military construction
project for the war or national emergency within the total unobligated military construction program.
Congress must be notified of all 2808 projects but does not require a 21-day delay of authorization of
funding. 
6.4.6.1.  Section 2808 authority was executed during OEF and OIF. Difficulties gaining access to
authorization of 2808 funds, lega l reviews and differing views of the extent of the authorities
caused delays in executing critical contingency construction projects. 
6.4.6.2.  Similar to Section 2803 funding, funds are taken from current year authorized construc-
tion projects. Normally, overseas projects are sacrificed to eliminate the cancellation of CONUS
based projects. 
6.5.  Other Authorities and Sources of Funding.  
6.5.1.  Burden sharing (Title 10, USC Section 2350j). This statute provides authority enabling the
DOD to accept funds from host natio n or foreign governments for bu rden sharing of construction,
supplies and services. Section 2350j funding is complicated by the inclusion of foreign nation invest-
ment and partnering. Additional information of 2350j can be found in JP 4-04 page F-2. Engineering
planners must involve their legal office in the consideration of utilizing this authority. 
6.5.2.  Economy in Government Act (Title 31, USC, Section 1535). This statute allows for US Gov-
ernment agencies, outside of the DOD, to fund AF  execution of contingency construction projects
providing they have the funds and authority to do so. Your legal office is critical in making the deter-
mination of request for utilization of this authority. 
6.5.3.  Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) (Title 10, USC, Section 401). Joint force engineers
may work with host nation government agencies to repair or improve infrastructure and public facili-
ties. These authorized and funded projects must fulfill unit training requirements that incidentally cre-
ate humanitarian benefit to the local populace. HCAs are usually planned well in advance and are
usually not in response to disasters, although some have been executed following disasters. Specific
engineer activities for which HCA funds can be us ed include construction of rudimentary surface
80
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
transportation systems, well drilling, construction of  basic sanitation facilities and rudimentary con-
struction and repair of facilities. 
6.5.4.  Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (FHA). In disaster operations, the UN and the Department of
State’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (U SAID) may generate funded requirements for DOD
assistance. FHA programs focus on the use of DO D excess property, emergency transportation sup-
port, disaster relief, or other support as necessary to alleviate urgent needs in a host country caused by
some type of natural or manmade disaster that might present serious threat to life or great damage to
or loss of property. While other elements of the joint force are focused on immediate FHA, civil engi-
neering support planning may focus on projects that provide expedient shelter for dislocated civilians.
The joint force engineer and staff should work closely with the representatives of the host nation and
US Country Team.

Chapter 7   
REDEPLOYMENT AND RECONSTITUTION 
7.1.  Overview. Expeditionary Airbases will transition as the mission and operational requirements
change. Base transition can be either improvement of construction standards as outlined in Chapter 6 or
return of the base back to host na tion ownerships when the US forces depart from the site. This chapter
will focus on base closure and return of the site back to host nation and/or civilian ownership or manage-
ment. 
7.2.  Transition. Since eventually an expeditionary airbase will transition back to civilian or host nation
control, deployed units should understand the theater level redeployment and reconstitution plan to better
carry out the operational requirem ents for their units. Redeployment operations are dependent upon the
combatant commander’s defined mission end state, peacekeeping requirements and host nation support
requirements. Reconstitution is defined as the process of returning deployed fo rces to full operational
readiness, to include personnel actions, training a nd equipment repair and replacement. Redeployment
normally occurs once the combatant commander has de creed that the deployed location will transition
from combat operations to civilian reconstruction or peacekeeping operations. 
Figure 7.1.  Recovery of BEAR Assets. 
7.2.1.  Transition operations cover a wide range of requirements that must be met prior to the last US
personnel or US contractor leaving the site. The general rule of thumb to go by is Leave the land and
infrastructure better than you found it. 
7.2.2.  Base engineers have seen the fallout of leavi ng a base in less than pristine condition when we
redeploy troops to an old s ite and run into the host nation engineer that was left with the clean-up
headache. Engineers will be responsible for the vast majority of clean-up requirements and in turn will
probably be some of the last troops to leave the site. 
82
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
7.3.  Redeployment. Redeployment applies to onward or forward deployment as well as return to home
station. Redeployment planning is essential to an ef fective and efficient return of deployed resources or
forward deployment of combat capability. Redeployment activities need to begin long before a redeploy-
ment order is received. Normally, the planning process begins upon arrival at the deployed location. This
ensures all deployed resources are accounted for and redeployment movement activities comply with host
nation customs requirements. Redeployment is not deployment in reverse. First, fragmented UTCs or unit
line numbers (ULN) are more likely to be incrementally redeploy ed/forward deployed to retain residual
capability at the original deployed location requiring the supportability of remaining forces. Planners need
to plan for the movement of parts of units, UTCs, or ULNs. Secondly, it is common to receive redeploy-
ment orders calling for the rede ployment of fragmented UTCs and UL Ns rather than a reverse TPFDD.
Additionally, due to military, political or diplomatic reasons, redeployment may be far more rapid than the
deployment phase, which makes early-on redeployment planning all the more critical. 
7.3.1.  During planning commanders must understand that redeployment can be a significant engi-
neering challenge, particularly when terminating overseas contingency operation. Civil engineer oper-
ations support force redeployment through the preparation of facilities for retrograde, completion of
construction projects and the refurbishment and turnover of property and real estate to the host nation. 
7.3.2.  Additionally, engineers terminate leases and facility contracts, construct wash racks and other
redeployment facilities, prepare collection points and coordinate for the safe disposition of hazardous
cargo. Commanders and civil engineers must be aware of legal consideration involved in these rede-
ployment activities. 
7.4.  General Considerations for Redeployment and Reconstitution. The situation, condition of assets
and the need for redeployment/reuse will dictate the extent and methods used for recovery and reconstitu-
tion. During deployments, CE teams can anticipate increased loss of equipment, tools and other resources
due to increased utilization and harsh climatic conditions. Your teams should strive to replace worn-out or
destroyed assets as they are lost (prior to redeployment) as in-theater equipment funding is much stronger
than at home equipment accounts. 
7.4.1.  CE leadership needs to ensure that funds expended are used to replace assets required and not
just desired as nice to haves. There have been numerous instances of deployed teams purchasing the
next greatest technology only to find out that it does not meet their need. 
7.4.2.  Teams also need to realize that assets purchased in theater to support operational requirements,
that are not listed on you teams equipment supply list (ESL) or Vehicle authorization list (VAL), will
need to be transferred to the incoming team for thei r use. This often occurs when units validate the
purchase of bobcats and gator transports in theater and hope to take them back for use at home station.
This is not practical because if you needed them in the ater so does your replacement. Secondly, at
close to $5,000 per hour for operation of airlift, it is cheaper to buy a new bobcat when you get home. 
7.5.  Reconstitution of BEAR Assets. Once erected, BEAR assets are operated and maintained primarily
by Prime BEEF and Services personnel. Depending on the situation and the asset, selected 49 MMG per-
sonnel, AFCESA’s CE Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Team (CEMIRT), or a trained theater support
contractor may also assist. The senior on-scene commander, who is normally the AEF/AEW commander,
must appoint a Bare Base Manager (BBM) at each location that is using BEAR. The BBM has custodial
responsibility for the BEAR assets until turned in for redeployment. Redeployment planning is a theater
responsibility. Assistance in striking assets is normally requested as needed from the 49 MMG through
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
83
Air Combat Command’s Logistics Plans office. Reconstitution occurs after the deployment mission
requirement has ended through either force redeploym ent or transition to temp orary or permanent stan-
dard facilities and utilities. Reconstitution usually involves extended operations to clean, inventory; per-
form intermediate- or depot-level maintenance and re pair and repackage assets for shipment or storage.
This effort is normally handled by the asset owner, usually 49 MMG or a theater operating location, or on
a limited basis it may include CEMIRT and AFCAP/LOGCAP/CONCAP or theater contractors prior to
shipment for storage. 
7.6.  Recovery. Unless there has been an attack with damage to the bare base, generally the term recovery
means the dissembling and repacking of BEAR systems for redeployment shipment to another location or
the demobilization and readying of the base for return to the national owners. For facilities such as person-
nel shelters, medical facilities, dining halls and smaller flightline shops, the user, Prime BEEF and logis-
tics personnel generally accomplish this. For larger shelters/hangars this may have to be accomplished by
RED HORSE, 49 MMG tea ms or trained teams from AFCAP/LOGCAP/CONCAP. Theater planners
should consider whether mobile support teams should be established to conduct recovery operations and
conduct user-level maintenance/repair prior to repacking. It may be readily apparent for some assets that
they can be reused without reconstitution. All parties participating in recovery need to make sure that the
designated BBM is properly informed and knows the condition of all assets before making the decision to
redeploy them forward or reutilize in the field. If they are not in a condition to allow for immediate erec-
tion and use for at least another six months, then the items must be identified as requiring maintenance or
identified that additional personnel and supplies may be required for erection and reuse. This is especially
important when the assets are vehicles and equipment items such as generators, high voltage electrical
distribution components, ROWPUs, pumps, bladders, etc., for utility system support. 
7.7.  Civil Engineering Support of Transition Operations. The deployed engineering squadron is one
of the last teams to leave the contingency airbase. The engineers normally have the main responsibility for
preparing the base for transition to a civilian led task force, military peacekeeping operation, base closure
or return of infrastructure to the host nation. Civil engineer squadrons should be prepared to support the
following transition requirements in addition to normal reconstitution and squadron redeployment priori-
ties: 
7.7.1.  Termination of base support contracts (refuse, Class IV materials, cleaning etc.). 
7.7.2.  Preparation of documentation for turnover of facilities and real estate. 
7.7.3.  Reconstitution of advance bases, staging areas and recovery/inventory and repacking of war
reserve material. 
7.7.4.  Definition and award of contingency support contracting (AFCAP, CONCAP, or LOGCAP) as

7.7.9.  Port surveys and coordination of port clearance requirements for movement of equip-ment and
assets. 
7.7.10.  Development and production of topographic, geographic and base utility tabs for future oper-
ations. 
7.7.11.  Construction of foreign humanitarian assistance and humanitarian civic assistance projects as
defined and negotiated by CREST or the theater engineer and combatant commander. 
7.8.  Redeployment Scheduling, Validation and Transport. Redeployment is scheduled and prioritized
by the combatant commander’s mission requirements and planning staff. It is imperative that the Combat-
ant Commander maintains the right balance of forces until he no longer requires them for mission accom-
plishment. In an effort to streamline this process, base level units need to have a redeployment plan in
place to be able to adequately schedule and meet redeployment timelines. To support this, the CE planner
needs to understand the process of  prioritizing, validating and schedu ling transport, regardless of the
mode of travel. 
7.9.  Redeployment Requirements Validation. Once a unit has been prior itized for redeployment, the
unit is responsible for confirming readiness posture, movement availability dates and passenger and cargo
details (load lists, weights etc.) to their higher commands, who will verify and prioritize movement sched-
uling. 
7.9.1.  The supported component commander receives the base reports and merges this into the rede-
ployment TPFDD, and adjusts prioritizations as required. 
7.9.2.  Once the prioritizations are finalized, the planning cell validates the lift requirements within the
specified TPFDD window of movement for USTRANSCOM movement scheduling. 
7.9.3.  USTRANSCOM conducts a transportation feasibility review and coordinates unresolved trans-
portation conflicts with the supported comma nder. Once completed, US-TRANSCOM forwards
requirement back to the supported commander as an approved TPFDD that redeploying units use for
scheduling. 
7.9.4.  Once scheduled the unit will be directed to proceed, IAW flow schedule, to a port of debarka-
tion for airlift back to home station or on to another mission requirement. 
7.9.5.  Lessons Learned on rede ployment. If a redeploying unit misrepresents its requirements
(weights, passengers, availability, etc.) during the planning phase of this process or fails to adequately
prepare for redeployment, their airlift or transport will be affected and possibly delayed. 
7.9.5.1.  During OIF and OEF a number of redeploying CE units were frustrated at the inability of
USTRANSCOM and TACC to schedule required airlift on the ap proved rotation dates. During
investigation of the problem, it was discovered that the retu rning units had requested dated
changes on a number of occasio ns, had changed passenger lists  and cargo load requirements
necessitating changes to airframes. The best way to ensure that your team gets home as scheduled
is to have a well thought out redeployment plan at the start of the deployment. This should include
passenger manifests (adjusts as the unit gains or loses personnel through combat attrition, injury or
reorganization), anticipated load plans (what did you bring versus what are you brining home) and
rotational requirements (know which passengers and equipment need to go where). 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
85
7.9.5.2.  The USTRANSCOM and TACC scheduling and validation process normally takes a min-
imum of 10 days during normal operational requirements. During contingency operations and
high periods of airlift demand this process can take up to 21 days with continual modifications and
changing mission requirements. As the CE planner or commander, you must keep visibility on the
TPFDD, airflow scheduling validation and potential problems. The only guarantee of a flight
home is the day that the TACC scheduler or logistics planner provides a tail number of the aircraft
you are flying home on. During redeployment, your logistics planner is your best friend; constant
coordination and partnering will get your team home. 
7.10.  Environmental Requirements. The Air Force is committed to maintaining a high level of envi-
ronmental quality during contingency operations. Civil engineers have a special role in helping to meet
this commitment and in full c ompliance with environmental standards. While the degree of complia nce
with these standards is affected by the location and activities performe d, and may vary during dif ferent
phases of contingencies, the goal is to restore a site  to predeployment condition and return it to the host
nation or appropriate agency. Areas of consideration include: 
7.10.1.  Hazardous waste storage/disposal, using the DRMO as a dis posal agent, hazardous material
labeling/packaging, mark/map abandoned wastewater facilities, preventing hazardous spills and min-
imizing air/noise pollution. 
7.10.2.  For detailed information on these and other environmental requirements during redeployment
and reconstitution, see AFH 10-222, Volume 4. 
7.11.  Conclusion. The end of hostilities, operations or disaster  recovery does not mean the end of the
Expeditionary Engineer responsibility. The CE Commander and personnel ne ed to plan to be one of the
last support functions to leave the deployed locations as they will be responsible for recovering the site to
better than its original condition, transfer of ownership of agreed facilities and environmental clean-up
and remediation. During OAF, OEF and OIF it was common for the operations and logistics groups at
deployed locations to depart, leaving the Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander or the senior MSG
squadron commander in charge of closing and recovering the base pr ior to redeployment. CE planners
need to start creating a redeployme nt plan during the initial deployment to ensure they have adequate
resources identified.

Chapter 8   
CONTRACT AUGMENTATION PROGRAMS 
8.1.  Overview. The military is one-third smaller today than a decade ago ye t averages almost twice the
number of deployments and contingency operations. This operational tempo versus resources highlights a
need to augment operational capa bility throughout the Department of Defense. In the early 1990s, the
DOD created contract augmentation programs or  CAP (LOGCAP, CONCAP, and AFCAP). These pro-
grams enabled the military to augment its current capabilities through the contract award of stand-by rapid
response force contracted civilian capabilities. It is not cheap to contract the stand-by rapid response, pro-
fessional expeditionary combat support and construction services of civilian contractors, but during con-
tingency operations it frees up military personnel to complete military missions while civilian contractors
take care of non-military specific requirements. 
8.2.  Air Force Guidance on Contractors in Theater of Operations. Civilian contractor personnel
accompanying Air Force forces are not combatants and must not be allowed to act as combatants during
Air Force operations. Civilian contractor personnel have historically provided support to fielded military
forces and international law allows for such activities. Therefore, it is Air Force policy to integrate
increased commercial support to the total force wher ever appropriate while preserving our core compe-
tencies. 
8.2.1.  The risks must be minimized when deciding to use contractors to provide essential services. In
fact, a uniformed capability should be maintained to provide essential services in the event the opera-
tional environment precludes the use of  contractors. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats
and Guidance, requires that full consideration of the impact of contractors must be addressed in devel-
oping operational plans. Commanders should limit the designation of essential contract services (IAW
DODI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DOD Contractor Services During Crisis) to those truly
indispensable to the accomplishment of the unit’s operational mission. Contracts will identify which
services are essential. If the contract has esse ntial services, contractor support requirements must be
integrated fully into the total force structur e and planning to ensure mission accomplishment . Any
determination regarding commercial support must consider the essential services that must be main-
tained and the risks associated due to possible contractor non-performance. Again, if contractors can’t
be used to do the job, military personnel must be integrated into the planning process. 
8.2.2.  Contractors are expected to comply with  all applicable US and international law. Unless
addressed otherwise by international agreement, contractor personnel are subject to the law of the
nation in which they are lo cated. This means that contractors must  be prepared to comply with all
local taxes, immigration requirements, customs fo rmalities and duties, environmental rules, bond or
insurance requirements, work permits and transporta tion or safety codes. The fact that the military
force for which they are performing services enjoys certain exemptions from local law does not mean
contractor personnel are also exempt--generally, contractor personnel are not exempt from local law.
During a declared war, contractor personnel accompanying the armed forces are subject to the crimi-
nal jurisdiction of the military and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. However, in all circum-
stances contractors are subject to host nation criminal law, unless specifically addressed otherwise by
international agreement. Contractor employees and other civilians accompanying the armed forces
may also be prosecuted by the United States for criminal acts. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
87
8.2.3.  When contractor personnel are deployed in support of Air Force operations, the Air Force may
provide or make available, under terms and conditions as specified in the contract, force protection
and support services commensurate with those provided to DOD civilian personnel to the extent
authorized by US and host nation law. These services may include but are not limited to medical/den-
tal care, messing, quarters, special clothing, equipment, training, mail and emergency notification. Air
Force units are to provide only those goods and services to contractor personnel that are specified in
the terms of the contract when authorized under host nation law or applicable international agreement.
If the Government provides support services to contractor personnel, it may increase the overall cost
to the Government. Planning to provide this suppor t to contractors must include a careful review of
host nation law and applicable international agreements as well as contract pricing, budget and mili-
tary manpower (reference AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2). Commanders and the requiring activity will
determine which services are essential and submit requirements, including proposed support services,
to the contracting officer to modify existing contracts. All future contracts will need a determination if
essential services exist and, if necessary, incorporate requirements in the statement of work (SOW).
SOW language should also include applicable deployment requirements, both medical and physical,
and allow for contractor information system interoperability with USAF and/or government informa-
tion systems. 
8.2.4.  During contingencies that do not constitute international armed conflicts, the status of contrac-
tor personnel accompanying the armed forces is entirely determined by host nation law or applicable
status of forces agreements, although contractors are seldom included in such agreements. During
contingencies that constitute international armed conflicts, contractor personnel are non-combatant
persons accompanying the armed forces but may be subject to hostile action because of the support
they provide in close proximity to combat forces. Commanders should take care to ensure contractor
personnel are not used in any mann er that would jeopardize their status under international law as
non-combatant persons accompanying the armed for ces. Assuming they have not jeopardized their
status as noncombatants, if cap tured during an international arme d conflict, contractor personnel
accompanying the armed forces are afforded the same protection granted to Prisoners of War (POWs)
under the Third Geneva Convention of 1949. 
8.2.5.  Air Force commanders should not issue firearms to contract or personnel operating on their
installations, nor should they allow contractor personnel to carry personally owned weapons. With the
express permission of the ge ographic combatant commander and in consultation with host nation
authorities, Air Force commanders may deviate from this prohib ition of firearms only in the most
unusual circumstances (e.g., for protection from bandits or dangerous animals if no military personnel
are present to provide protection). 
8.2.6.  Air Force commande rs should not issue military garmen ts (e.g., battle dress uniforms or
Gore-Tex jackets) to contractor personnel. Exceptions may be made for compelling reasons such as a
need for chemical protective equipment when the contract requires the Government to issue such
items rather than requiring the contractor to provide them to its personnel. Should commanders issue
any type of standard uniform item to contractor personnel, care must be taken to require that the con-
tractor personnel be distinguishable from military personnel with some distinctively colored patches,
armbands, or headgear. 
8.2.7.  Although many contractor personnel supporting Air Force operations are former military mem-
bers, the contract and commanders must make it clear that contractor personnel have no military sta-
tus. 
88

8.3.  Air Force Contract Augmentation Program. Air Force policy is to in tegrate increased commer-
cial support into the total force wherever appropria te while preserving its co re uniformed competencies
(for complete Air Force policy governing contractors in the theater, see Appendix E). In support of this,
the AF has developed the AFCAP concept. The AFCAP contract provides the following support. 
8.3.1.  Commander Support. AFCAP provides commanders a responsive, force multiplier option to
augment or relieve expeditionary combat support functions participating in military operations other
than war (MOOTW) or small-scale contingencies (SSCs). 
8.3.2.  Quick Response, Contract Deployment Capability. AFCAP is a contract with extensive world-
wide support capabilities, able to respond in minimal time. Capab ilities focus on temporary contin-
gency skills and/or resources to sustain military forces participating in MOOTW/SSCs or to recover
from a natural disaster, accident, or terrorist attack. 
8.3.3.  Planning and Deployment. The contractor shall provide the personnel, equipment, materials,
services, travel and all other me ans necessary to provide a  quick response, worldwide planning and
deployment capability. Planning is expected to be available within the contractor’s program manage-
ment team and other company resources. Deployment capabilities are to be obtained as required for a
site-specific scenario. The capabilities under this contract are intended to support Air Force MOOTW/
SSC activities operating in support of National Command Authority missions, which could include
(but are not limited to) joint or combined United States military forces acting as part of or in concert
with United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), multinational force, or other
entities. MOOTW/SSCs may include Air Force required support to na tural disaster relief operations
within and outside CONUS. 
8.3.4.  Deployment Capabilities. The principal effort of this contract will be to provide deployment
capabilities generally aligned with Air Force combat suppor t and combat service support functions
associated with expeditionary combat support, to include the Civil Engineer and Services career fields
and to provide logistic support that reduces a dependence on scarce war reserve materiel stockpiles. A
partial list of skills typically required include: carpentry, plumbing, electrical, mechanical (e.g., refrig-
eration, air conditioning, heat, controls, etc.), heavy equipment, paint, power production, food service,
lodging management, recreational services, housekeeping services, laundry plant operation, various
utility plant operations (e.g., water, sewage, solid waste disposal, et c.), structural fire protection and
fire crash rescue, unexploded or dnance (UXO) technician (e.g., cl earing sub-scale practice bombs),
emergency management, professional engineering, and project and program management. 
8.3.5.  Program Management Office. The contractor shall provide the necessary supplies, equipment
and personnel to sustain administrative/management support for the Air Force Contract Augmentation
Program (AFCAP). Minimum requirements include: having a dedicated program management office
within a 25-mile radius of Tyndall AFB, FL, with the capability to develop Rough Order of Magnitude
(ROM) cost estimates and execute individual task orders. This program management office shall be
available for support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
8.3.6.  Types of Response. Because military forces are trained and equipped for rapid deployment and
flexible support for a variety of scenarios, the e xpectation is that initial response to a MOOTW/SSC
will generally be assigned to mi litary forces. As these forces establish a ba se(s) of operations and
extended activities are likely to occur , AFCAP relief, augmentation, or expansion are potential
resource options. However, the above statement does not rule out the possibility that AFCAP contract
support may be the initial responder in selected scenarios, particularly small scale, fast moving, iso-
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
89
lated location scenarios or during worldwide recovery operations. In addition, work may include
MOOTW/SSC backfill support at existing operational Air Force bases within and outside the United
States to augment sustaining forces. 
8.3.7.  Background. AFCAP represents an initiative to contract for base operating support and tempo-
rary construction capabilities to relieve or augment military support forces and resources involved in
MOOTW/SSCs. MOOTW are described as military actions, except those associated with sustained,
large-scale combat operations and SSC is a new  term for military operations other than war. These
military actions can be applied to complement any combination of the other instruments of national
power and occur before and after war [Joint Publication 3-07]. Generally, these operations will occur
in a noncombatant, forward deploy ed environment (outside United States territory). However, this
does not eliminate the possibility of natural disaster  support or home base backfill sustainment sup-
port in the United States. 
8.3.8.  Typical Air Force Deployment Locations. With rare exceptions, Air Force deployments are tied
to airfields which typically contain at least some existing buildings and utility infrastructure. There-
fore, deployment support will usually include a variety of operation and maintenance (O&M) require-
ments to fixed, existing real property, as well as providing measures to augment or emplace additional
temporary services and facilities. 
8.3.9.  Customers. Through the AFCAP Program Manageme nt Office, this contract is established to
support Air Force major commands (MAJCOM) and associated component commanders. 
8.3.10.  Deployment Capabilities. All expeditionary combat support functions to include but not lim-
ited to the following tasks.

and temporary joint service construction standards. The contractor shall use these standards to help
determine the types of materials and construction techniques to be employed. These construction stan-
dards provide criteria that minimize construction efforts while providing facilities of a quality consis-
tent with the mission requiremen ts, personnel health and safety, and the expected availability of
construction resources. These criteria can be met by commercial of f-the-shelf building systems that
are rapidly erectable and yet have a life span that exceeds even the temporary standard if that alterna-
tive is cost or operationally effective. 
8.6.5.  Semi-Permanent and Permanent Construction. The contractor shall be capable of accomplish-
ing semi-permanent and permanent construction. It is imperative that the scope and required specifi-
cations be explicitly called out within the defini tion of the task order. These requirements will
generally be accomplished as a turn-key effort. 
8.6.6.  Backfill Support. MOOTW/SS C support may entail a requirement to augment the sustaining
force at an Air Force base whethe r in CONUS or overseas. This back fill support will not be in the
form of personal services. 
8.7.  Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). LOGCAP is authorized by Army Regulation
700-137, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). The Department of the Army’s Deputy
Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) is the proponent, and the Army Corps of Engineers is the contracting
activity. Its purpose is to use civilian contractors to perform selected services for military forces deployed
to a theater of operations. The support includes trans portation, food service, ice, potable water, laundry,
showers, latrines, refuse removal, contingency equipment, and an unskilled labor pool. The mission state-
ment requires the contractor, on order and within 15 days , to initiate specific logistical and engineering
support for 20,000 arriving troops for up to 180 days. 
8.7.1.  LOGCAP should be accessed through the Army’s theater level G4/S4 (Logistics and Engineer-
ing) staff or the CFACC Engineer (A7). LOGCAP is managed by the LOGCAP Support Unit (LSU)
in Alexandria, Virginia. If you require direct access or have additional questions on LOGCAP organi-
zation, capabilities, and execution, contact the LSU at: AMCLG-TPU, LOGCAP Support Unit, 5001
Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22333-0001, (703) 617-0556 or call DSN 767-0556. 
8.7.2.  LOGCAP is primarily designed for use in ar eas where no bilateral or multilateral agreements
exist. However, LOGCAP may provide additional support in areas with formal host nation support
(HNS) agreements, where other contractors are involved, or where peacetime support contracts exist.
LOGCAP is also available during Continental United States (CONUS) mobilizations to assist the
CONUS support base and help units get ready for war. 
8.7.3.  LOGCAP includes all pre-planned logistics and engineering/construction oriented contingency
contracts actually awarded. LOGCAP also includes peacetime contracts which include contingency
clauses that provide rapid and responsive capability that augments US forces’ capabilities by meeting
logistics and engineering/construction requirements. 
8.7.4.  The Army has used contr actors to provide supplies and se rvices during both peacetime and
contingencies dating back to the Revolutionary War. LOGCAP was established on 6 December 1985
with the publication of Army Regulation 700-137, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program. The newly
established program was used in 1988 when the Third United S tates Army requested that the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) contract out a management plan to construct and maintain two
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
95
petroleum pipeline systems in Southwest Asia in support of contingency operations. Since its incep-
tion, LOGCAP has supported US Army operations in Rwanda, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Kosovo, Ecuador,
Qatar, Italy, Southern Europe, Bosnia, Panama, Korea, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
8.7.5.  LOGCAP capabilities include supply operations, clot hing exchange and repair, mortuary
affairs, billeting, facilities management, information management, transportation, engineering and
construction, equipment retrograde, laundry, food services, hazardous waste disposal, personnel sup-
port to include MWR, maintenance, medical services, power generation and distribution, and other
operations and services. 
8.8.  US Navy Contingency Construction Capabilities (CONCAP). The Navy's civilian augmentation
program was started to enhance the Naval Facilities Engineering Command's (NAVFAC) ability to
respond to global contingencies. The immediate need was to supplement the capabilities of local com-
manders and regional resources. 
8.8.1.  CONCAP provides the Navy and Marine Corps with a responsive contracting vehicle ready to
respond to contingencies or natural disasters. It provides for indefinite deliveries and quantities using
a cost-plus-award-fee contract for design, construction and services to support the Navy in war, disas-
ter recovery, and military operations other than war. CONCAP is suitable for those situations in which
the mission parameters exceed normal acquisition timing, there is an aust ere contingency environ-
ment, and facility requirements are not well defined. 
8.8.2.  The contract calls for a broad range of capabilities in both vertical and horizontal construction
scenarios. 
8.8.3.  CONCAP helps the Navy stay within its force ceilings and frees uniformed Navy personnel for
contingency operations. The contract specifies what may be required and includes time parameters for
setting up quick, behind-the-lines facility support for troops. It also  frees up Seabees to support the
fight. 
8.8.4.  CONCAP capabilities include: 
8.8.4.1.  Horizontal/vertical construction (runways, roads, br idges, causeways, piers, berthing/
messing facilities, depots, warehouses, clinics, field hospitals, operational/maintenance facilities,
communications infrastructure, and ammunition dumps). 
8.8.4.2.  Specialty construction and engineering (d redging, aerial photography, soils engineering
and surveys, operation of power generation, concrete and asphalt plants, POL facilities, and envi-
ronmental restoration). 
8.8.4.3.  CONCAP’s primary focus is to support day-to-day operations, construction, and manage-
ment of Navy permanent bases. CONCAP is not a viable alternative for initial standard contin-
gency construction, but can be ut ilized in the event AFCAP or LOGCAP are not available for
large-scale permanent construction requirements at expeditionary beddown locations. 
8.8.5.  CONCAP has been utilized dur ing requirements in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia; during Hurri-
cane Andrew (October 1995), Hurricane Bertha (July 1996), and Hurricane Fran (September 1996). In
2002, CONCAP built detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
8.9.  Conclusion. The various contract augmentation programs offer the component/theater engineer and
commander various options, other than utilization of  limited military resources, to complete specified
96
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
expeditionary combat support services, construction, management, and logistics. The increased cost is
worth the on-call capabilities that the programs offer. All programs must be accessed through the appro-
priate management function: AFCAP through AFCESA, at Tyndall AFB; LOGCAP via LSU in Alexan-
dria, Virginia; and CONCAP through NAVFAC at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington DC.

Attachment 3   
MAIN OPERATING BASE AUTHORIZED FACILITIES/CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS 
A3.1.  Main Operating Base (MOB) Facilities. MOBs are occupied by a wing or larger unit (US popu-
lation of 500 or more) and are cont inuously operated camps with command, staff and logistic functions.
The standards outlined in this section apply to all MOBs. Since the in itial construction standards consist
mainly of unit organic equipment or bare base depl oyable assets, the discussion below concentrates pri-
marily on temporary construction standards. 
A3.2.  Roads. Primary roads identified by commanders on ba se camp master plans are authorized for
paving with asphalt. Primary roads ar e considered as major arteries th at support the majority of vehicle
traffic through the base. Concrete turning pads are authorized to prevent damage to asphalt roads. Second-
ary and perimeter patrol roads are to be surfaced with gravel. 
A3.3.  Dining Facilities. Dining facilities will provide 640 sq ft of dining room space and 320 total sq ft
of kitchen, admin and storage space per 750 assigned personnel. Adequate space for cleaning, latrine, and
clothes changing for local national kitchen staf f will be provided. Sanitary wall board (SWB) or other
waterproof material will be used in the kitchen and latrine areas. Loading dock can be concrete, asphalt,
or treated lumber. Portable sanitary hand-washing stations will be located at the entrance of the dining
facility. 
A3.4.  Lodging Standards. Table A3.1. gives the authorized square footage for unaccompanied person-
nel housing (UPH) space for deployed military personnel, government mission essential civilians, and
assigned DOD contractors. Table A3.2. gives the authorized square footage for UPH billeting space for
civilians and contractors who are deployed greater than 6 months. Table A3.3. gives the authorized square
footage for UPH billeting space for military personnel deployed greater than six months.

Table A3.2.  Housing Standards for Long-term Civilian/Contractor Employees (>6 mo.s). 
Table A3.3.  Housing Standards for Long-term Military Personnel (>6 Months). 
A3.4.1.  The US Army utilizes the S outh-East Asia Hut (SEA hut) as its base module for temporary
and semi permanent construction standard billeting. The SEA hut is a wood framed, elevated building
with exterior covered walkways that is utilized for billeting. SEA Huts are normally grouped together
and are collocated with a latrine and shower huts. Standard SEA huts are 512 square feet, with a stan-
dard SEA hut cluster having five bays and a latrine (2,944 sq ft). SEA hut structures provide a greater
degree of safety and comfort than hard backed GP Mediums or TEMPER tent. SEA huts may be sub-
divided for individual rooms and common areas based on grade/rank of inhabitants. SEA huts provide
an expedient and more cost effective solution than contracted modular facilities as they are easily fab-
ricated by either contract or military labor. SEA huts organized in this manner minimize the distance
personnel are required to walk to shower and latrine facilities and increases unit cohesion by maintain-
ing company, platoon and squad integrity. 
A3.4.2.  Private (modular or partitioned SEA hut) and semi-private billeting space for the housing of
long-term (exceeding 6 months) government civilian/ all contractor employees and airmen should be
considered at the earliest possible time. The Theater Engineer (A7) will determine grade equivalen-
cies for DOD contractor employees. The MSG Commander is delegated the responsibility to resolve
private room availability for long-term civilian/contractor employees and airmen at their assigned air-
base.

A3.4.3.  All 110/220 volt electric outlets in billeting facilities will be protected by not more than 30
amp ground fault circuit interrupter. Highest protection level will be selected to protect against electric
shock hazard. Where practical, billeting should be c onfigured into clusters with shower, shave and
latrine units collocated within the clusters. Standard 5’ (minimum width) covered walkways should be
provided to allow personnel to walk under cover to latrine units. Sufficient space will be maintained
between facilities to allow fire trucks and other safety vehicles driving space. Carpet is not authorized
in living or office areas.

available to the manned security forces entry control point. 
A3.20.  Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) System. For final planning consult with the theater
medical planner to determine which level of EMED S will be deployed. The la rgest deployed EMEDS
planning factor is for an EMEDS+ 114 theater hospital and staging area. EMEDS+ 114 requires 400-kW
of power, 11,000 gallons of potable water per day, 675 pounds of ice per day, and produces 11,286 gallons
of waste water and 4,500 pounds of solid waste per day. Additional information regarding EMEDS plan-
ning can be found in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5. 
A3.20.1.  Special Medical Requirements. The follow ing spaces will include a sink with running hot
and cold water: examination rooms, trauma/treatment rooms, laboratory and dental treatment rooms.
Dental sterilization radiology rooms will require lead  shielding appropriate to the type of radiology
equipment utilized. This includes all four walls and servicing door (lead shielded). The minimum
thickness level and specifications for installation may be determined through consultation with the
supporting Health Facilities Planning Office (HFPO) or Preventive Medicine Office. Specific consid-
eration should be given to ensure ventilation from the x-ray development, dental sterilization and lab-
oratory spaces. Finished materials should support infection control measures by incorporating smooth

washable surfaces with limited seams throughout. All interior partitions shall be constructed from the
floor to the underside of the ceiling and will not be undercut or left open at the top. Lighting and elec-
trical requirements for each space will be coordinated with HFPO in consideration of existing and
planned medical equipment. 
A3.20.2.  Air Force Transportable Hospital (AFTH) Location. Locate medical facilities on the base to
support the command’s mission requirements. Consideration should be given to daily sick call opera-
tions and the relative proximity to the troop population and emergency medical operations (evacuation
operations both into and out of th e clinic by ground and air). The st andard base camp clinic will be
sized to meet the medical and dental care expectations of the population stipulated in the operations
order and supported by the medical staff. 
A3.21.  Maintenance Facilities. Each AEW should strive to consolidate maintenance activities as much
as possible. A facility size at a rate of 1,840 sq ft per AEW Group supported by the facility is authorized.

ties will be equipped with inside and outside lights, as well as exhaust fans and compressed air. 
A3.22.  Maintenance (MX) Administration. 640 sq ft of office space is authorized for each MX flight. 
A3.23.  Maintenance Parking Area. Each MX group is authorized a parking area of a sufficient size to
accommodate outside maintenance of wing vehicles. Pads should be large enough to accommodate the
largest vehicle maintained plus a recovery vehicle. Maintenance pads for tracked and wheeled vehicles (if
supported by base MX) will be constructed from concrete. Maintenance pads will be located near the unit
maintenance bay, usually as aprons to a consolidated maintenance facility. 
A3.24.  Fuel Storage. Above ground fuel tanks are authorized for the storage of bulk fuels. Fuel storage
bladders will be phased out as above ground storage tanks become available. Tanks will be constructed
IAW existing environmental regulations and installed per manufacturer recommendations. Where it is
necessary to use fuel bladders, they will be sited IAW environmental guidelines and will be surrounded by
a constructed containment structure large enough to contain the maximum amount of fuel in the bladder
to contain any spillage. Fuel truck parking will have secondary containment pads equipped with a catch-
ment sump and grounding rods. 
A3.25.  Hazardous Waste Collection Points. Each AEW Group will have a covered hazardous waste
collection point, built on an elev ated pad, to be out of contact w ith ground surface and have permanent
secondary containment system. AEW commanders may authorize additional collection points at bases as
required to support their mission. 
A3.26.  Hazardous Material Warehouse. Each AEW is authorized a hazardous materials warehouse at
a size rate of 1,000 sq ft per 1,000 assigned personnel. 
A3.27.  Parking Lots. Parking lots should be constructed usi ng well-graded rock and compacted, with
engineered slope and drainage to minimize weather effects and increase safety. Avoid loose rocks greater
than 30-40. The purpose is to minimize damage to gravel parking lots and to prevent damage to vehicles
from flying rocks. Wooden parking lot stripes are not authorized. Concrete turning pads are authorized for

health reasons and ease of cleaning. Kennel floor drains should be connected to a sewer system. The ken-
nel-planning factor is 145 sq ft per dog, which includes kitchen, tack room and interior dog run, (36 sq ft
per dog). Exterior dog runs should be 48 sq ft per dog, with a connecting guillotine-type door to the inte-
rior dog run. Additional information is located in AFI 31-202, Military Working Dog Program. 
A3.30.  Morgue. Each morgue is authorized 512 sq ft of workspace an d a refrigeration van. Privacy
screen is authorized around the entire facility. 
A3.31.  Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office. One recycling facility per task force is authorized
at a size of one sq ft per MOB employee (e.g. soldier, civilian, host country national). It should have con-
crete or asphalt floor capable of handling forklifts. 
A3.32.  Ammunition Supply Point (ASP). The ASP, if applicable to the base camp, will not house
ammunition in containers. If the mission dictates containers be temporarily used, then only DOD-owned
containers will be used. Any DOD containers used must be a temporary arrangement until bunkers can be
constructed. The ASP will be constructed with bunkers and space allocations (safety requirements) to
meet the net explosive weight of the planned stored ammunition. Consult theater CE and SFS planners for
additional guidance. 
A3.33.  Basic Load and Captured Ammunition Holding Areas. Ammunition holding areas will be
constructed in accordance with AR 385-64, U.S. Army Explosives Safety Program, and DA PAM 385-64,
Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Ammunition holding areas will have containment berms, a
fenced and lighted perimeter, graveled access roads and lightning protection for the entire area. Ammuni-
tion will be stored in protective st ructures such as MILVAN containers that are out of con tact with the
ground (on wooden sleepers or on concrete foundations). 
A3.34.  Wash Rack. Each MOB is authorized at minimum one 45’ long elevated vehicle wash rack, one
100’ flat wash rack and one container wash rack equipped with oil/water separators. Wash racks shall be

ical, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive Emergency Response Guidelines; AR 420-90,
National Fire Protection Association Codes, and the following standards: 
A3.35.1.  Fire Departments will be established only at base camps with a population of 1,000 or more
US personnel (permanent residents), or where US Air Force flight operations and/or Army
rotary-wing flight operations dictate based on flightline response requirements. Refer to theater CE
Fire Planner to dictate requirements as they are based on assigned weapons systems. 
A3.35.2.  Base camps that do not meet the criteria above will use appropriate portable fire extinguish-
ers. Fire and emergency personnel will be properly trained on the use of extinguishers. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
119
A3.35.3.  The AOR Fire Chief, in coordination with the theater CE (A7), will determine the type and
number of fire extinguishers required. 
A3.35.3.1.  For MOBs with fire departments the following applies: 
A3.35.3.2.  The number and type of fire apparatus for structural and aircraft rescue and fire fight-
ing (ARFF) response will be determined IAW DODI 6055.6, DOD Fire Protection Program, AR
420-90, Fire and Emergency Services, and NFPA Codes. 
A3.35.3.3.  Fire and emergency services will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
A3.35.3.4.  Construction of one fire station per base camp is author ized to be built to house fire
fighters and fire trucks, as recommended by the theater A7 and theater Fire Chief. 
A3.35.3.5.  Fire fighting facilities will be co-located and fire fighters should live at the fire station
to reduce response time, if appropriate and determined by the theater A7. 
A3.35.3.6.  One classroom/library is required for firefighting training, fire prevention safety
inspection training, and to maintain regulations, NFPA Codes, International Fire Service Training
Association Training Materials, etc. 
A3.35.3.7.  Records holding area is required of training, inspections, and fire response activities. 
A3.35.3.8.  One fire control center per base camp is authorized. 
A3.35.3.9.  Fire Protection and fire prevention staffing will be in accordance with AR 420-90 and
DODI 6055.6. 
A3.35.3.10.  For fire fighting pu rposes, base camps are authoriz ed one 5,000-gallon tanker for
water storage. The tanker will be  capable of tapping into the potable water storage. Centrally
located standpipes for filling the tankers should be added to the potable wate r system to fill the
tanker. Manning of ARFF vehicles will be during airfield operational hours. 
A3.35.3.11.  Due to intrusion and security concerns, SCIF Facilities will use a battery operated fire
alarm and detection system. Central reporting lines and radio transmitted alarms will not broadcast
through the SCIF shielding and/or pose a threat for release of secure compartmental information. 
A3.36.  Utilities. Utility systems shall be designed based on current applicable military handbooks, tech-
nical manuals and guidance. Engineering calculations will be used to size the system. All utility designs
will be approved by Depu ty Chief of Staff for Engineering (DCSENG), United States Army, Europe
(USAREUR) before construction begins. 
A3.36.1.  Electric Power. Where economically supportable and practicable, base camp power grids
will be connected to commercial power. Smaller or remote base camps that cannot be economically
connected to the commercial power grid are author ized to construct central power plants capable to
support 125% of camp maximum demand load, or use distributed generators of sufficient capacity to
support maximum demand loads. An  economic analysis should be co mpleted to determine the most
cost effective power plant/generator solution. In all cases, critical fa cilities will be identified in the
master plan by the mission support group commander and have back-up generator power. Non-critical
facilities that have stand-alone distributed generators will not have any b ack-up generator power. A
maximum of 10% of total generators (one minimum) serving non-critical facilities are authorized as
reserve generators that can be placed in service quickly in case a generator serving a non-critical facil-
ity has a major failure. 
120
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
A3.36.1.1.  Determination of appropriate size for generators is not a simple task, as many genera-
tors are typically over-sized for loads served. Sizing of generators shall include an evaluation of
actual and expected loads considering appropriate demand and load diversity factors, along with a
review of any historical demand load data for similar base camps. Engine-generator sets may need
de-rating to account for use of JP -8 fuel (rather than diesel), altitude, temperature and starting
requirements for any large load specialized equipment (e.g., hospital X-ray machines). In many
cases, load banks have been used to ensure adequate performance of under loaded engine-genera-
tor sets. Under loaded engine-generators may operate unsatisfactorily, fail prematurely, and
require more maintenance and overhauls due to excessive formation of carbon deposits in the
engine. The use of load banks and premature engine overhauls can be avoided if engine-generators
are right-sized for the load. A complete and through analysis of the affected electrical system must
be accomplished to ensure power plant requirements are properly defined. Leasing of generators
for periods greater than six months is generally not cost effective. 
A3.36.1.2.  Where stand-alone distributed generators are the main power source, they will be sized
so no generator set is loaded less than 50%. 
A3.36.1.3.  Electrical power systems for the MOBs and forward operating bases can be composed
of sub-transmission lines to main substations; distribution lines to distribution substations; utiliza-
tion lines to distribution transformers; and gene rators to provide emergency, stand-by and/or
prime power for mission base camp facilities. Application of the new Distributed Generation (DG)
Technology other than the matured Internal Combustion (IC) Genset (diesel engines) technology,
maybe considered if economically feasible, environmental impacts and emissions are critical, and
alternative fuels for DG applications are available. DG including IC Gensets allow cogeneration
(combined heat and power). The waste heat from power generation may be recovered and used to
offset costs. Today, the capital cost of an IC Genset is 200-350 $/Kilowatt (kW) rating for diesel
and 400-1000 $/kW for natural ga s. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs for both types
excluding fuel are 0.01$/kWh/yr. Currently, DGs have high initia l costs; however they are the
future for power generation. 
A3.36.1.4.  At end state or earlier, electric power supply, transformers 400/208 volts 50 Hertz (Hz)
and/or 230/120 volts 50 Hz should be used in lieu of 208/120 volt generators. 50 Hz to 60 Hz
rotating or static (preferred) fre quency converters should be used in lieu of 60 Hz generators.
Applicable electrical industry codes, standards, or publications will apply to equipment, materials
and construction covered in the Base Camp Facilities Standards. The minimum requirements of
the latest version of NFPA-70, National Electrical Code, and American National Standards Insti-
tute C2, the National Electrical Safety Code, will be met and exceeded when requirements that are
more stringent are specified an d/or directed. These standards provide policy and guidance for
main and forward base camp design criteria and standards for electrical power supply and distri-
bution systems. Requirements of Military Handbook 1191, Medical and Dental Treatment Facility
Criteria, and other medical facilities design office criteria will be considered for power arrange-
ments for medical facilities. 
A3.36.1.5.  All facilities th at are used for or c ontain housing, office space, or other a reas that
require the use of electric devices and/or equipment will be supplied with sufficient fixed electri-
cal outlets. SEA huts used for housing will have eight fixed duplex electrical outlets. All facilities
that require illumination to perform tasks or in order to provide a safe living, working, or recre-
ational environment will be equipped with sufficient electric lights. 
AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006
121
A3.36.2.  Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC). At a minimum, all facilities where per-
sonnel live, work or recreate will be provided heating. Install ECUs that provide heating and cooling
capabilities whenever possible. Large facilities such as dining facilities an d expeditionary hospitals
should be provided with central HVAC systems. Camps will utilize installed central heating/cooling
systems where already existing or as economically feasible. Storage areas will only be provided heat-
ing/cooling services as needed to address specific storage requirements of designated facilities types.
When temporary and semi-permanent facilities such as SEA huts utilize ECUs, they will be sized to
ensure delivery of heating/cooling as follows. 
A3.36.2.1.  The standard for maximum indoor temperature in winter is 68oF and minimum indoor
temperature in summer is 78oF. Temperature strips are installed in administrative areas and living
spaces wherever ECUs are utilized. 
A3.36.2.2.  Where central heating/cooling systems are pre-existing or have been installed for all
other facilities (e.g. hangars, recreation centers, gyms, dining facilities, medical facilities, etc) the
support staff will monitor installed thermostatic controls to maintain established temperature stan-
dards. 
A3.37.  Water. The order of preference for potable water at MOBs is: 
A3.37.1.  Joint Contracting Center (JCC) will contract to tie into local municipalities if it is economi-
cally feasible and meets Army health and force protection standards. The installation of a water puri-
fying station, such as a UV-60, Transportable Water Purification and Disinfection System, should be
considered in the start up cost. 
A3.37.2.  Installation of wells for potable water is authorized. Site planning should consider installing
water storage distribution systems if economically feasible. A mi nimum of two wells per camp, one
primary and one for back up are authorized. The expense of mobilization for drilling equipment rep-
resents a major cost of providing a well. Therefore, local contractors should be hired to perform well
drilling. Additional wells may be dr illed based on the capability of the first two wells to supply the
required amount of water. Wells should be within camp boundaries. 
A3.37.3.  The least desirable option is trucking po table water and/or bottle water to the base camp.
The cost of purchasing and maintaining the trucks, along with drivers and the reoccurring cost of bot-
tle water to include purchase, transport, storage, and waste disposal needs should be included in the
initial cost estimate. 
A3.38.  Wastewater Treatment Plant. The initial assessment for a base  camp should have a design for
the installation of a wastewater plan t based on projected population si ze of the camp, to include Allied
forces and local nationals. Coordination with JCC s hould be utilized to dete rmine if connection to a
municipal wastewater treatment plant is economically feasible and environmentally sound. Upgrades to
existing sewage treatment plants are authorized to allow for effective treatment of waste being generated
on that facility. Connection to local waste treatment facilities should be made only if the facilities meet
Army standards. Upgrades will be limited to the expansion of the plant’s current capabilities to handle the
increased daily flows. 
A3.39.  Quality of Life (QOL) and Personnel Support. Personnel facility support for MOBs are
intended to improve the QOL for assigned personnel. On MOBs where commanders have made the deci-
sion to split personnel support, MWR, AAFES services or concessions according to geographic location,
122
