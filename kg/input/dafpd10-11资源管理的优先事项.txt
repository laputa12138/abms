1.  Background.  This publication implements Department of the Air Force policy governing the 
assignment of FAD ratings for prioritization of Department of the Air Force units, activities, 
projects, and programs. The DoD governs the priority allocation of resources through the Uniform 
Materiel Management Issue Priority System (UMMIPS). The UMMIPS uses FADs in conjunction 
with Urgency of Need Designators (UND) to establish a matrix of priorities for supply 
requisitioning and the transportation system. 
2.  Policy.  In accordance with DoD Manual 4140.01 V1 and CJCSI 4110.01E, the Chief of Staff 
of the Air Force (CSAF) and Chief of Space Operations are delegated authority to assign FADs II 
through V to assigned units, activities, projects, and programs. This DAFPD implements policy 
further delegating this authority to the Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans and Requirements 
(AF/A3) and the United States Space Force (USSF) Deputy Chief of Space Operations for 
Operations (informally referred to as the Chief Operations Officer (SF/COO)). FAD I 
recommendations are made by the CSAF and Chief of Space Operations.  FAD I requests will be 
submitted by the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection (AF/A4) and 
to the SF/S4 equivalent as the Service’s JMPAB members. 
3.  Roles and Responsibilities.

Terms 
Force/Activity Designators (FADs)—A Roman numeral (I to V) that the Secretary of Defense, 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or a DoD component assigns to a unit, organization, 
installation, project, or program to indicate its relative mission essentiality. The FAD is an integral 
part of the UMMIPS. FADs used in conjunction with Urgency of Need Designators to establish a 
DAFPD10-11  21 MAY 2021

matrix of priorities used for supply requisitions. FADs are ranked as FAD I representing the highest 
priority and FAD V representing the lowest priority. 
Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS)—UMMIPS sets priorities 
for the issuance and movement of materiel. The system enables supply customers to use one of 15 
priority designators when requisitioning supply items. These 15 priority designators are based on 
two components: the Urgency of Need Designator defines the relative importance of the item 
ordered to the unit’s mission and the FAD defines the relative importance of the unit placing the 
order. 
Urgency of Need Designator (UND)—Indicates the importance of a requisition relative to its 
mission and is assigned by the customer or requisitioner.
