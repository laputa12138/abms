PURPOSE:  The Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42 series of 
publications is the primary reference for medical combat support capability.  This document, 
AFTTP 3-42.7, provides an overview of the Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support 
System.  In August 1998, the Air Force Chief of Staff directed the Air Force transition to the 
concept of an Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF).  The Air Force Surgeon General tasked the 
Air Combat Command Surgeon to lead the development of an expeditionary medical support 
capability and the next generation Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH).  This Aerospace Medical 
Contingency Ground Support System tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) document 
describes the manner in which the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) supports aerospace 
expeditionary force (AEF) forces. 
 
APPLICATION:  This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel 
(including Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC] and Air National Guard [ANG] units and 
members).  The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not directive. 
 
SCOPE:  The AFMS must be ready and capable of providing required medical support to the 
warfighters no matter the scenario.  Potential deployments include the full spectrum of deployed 
contingencies.  A robust medical war reserve materiel (WRM) program is essential to meeting 
the logistics requirements of this capability.  This system begins with an initial force package 
known as the squadron medical element (SME) progressing to the fully developed stage of the 
mature AFTH where significant specialty care capability and intensive care will be available.  It 
is critical that the AFMS continue to deliver essential care targeted towards optimizing 
warfighter performance.

Chapter 1 
 
AEROSPACE MEDICAL CONTINGENCY GROUND SUPPORT SYSTEM 
 
1.1.  Mission. 
 
1.1.1.  The Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System represents the 
cornerstone of medical support to AEF forces deployed in any worldwide contingency.  This 
system is composed of unit type code (UTC) building blocks that provide personnel and 
equipment to meet specific operational requirements.  The Aerospace Medical Contingency 
Ground Support System begins with squadron medical elements (SMEs), independent duty 
medical technicians (IDMTs), and ends with a 100+bed Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) 
facility. 
 
1.1.2.  The mission of the AFMS Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System is 
to rapidly deploy and provide forward stabilization, primary care, dental services, force 
health protection, and to prepare for aeromedical evacuation of aerospace expeditionary 
forces or civilian casualties, as appropriate.  This system optimizes warfighter performance 
by delivering essential care targeted to maximize unit effectiveness, readiness, and morale 
with minimal cost in terms of weight, cube, lift, and forward footprint. 
 
1.1.3.  Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System components deploy in 
various combinations to support a specific theater/regional population size and deployment 
scenario.  Medical support rapidly deploys in a modular, incremental, and interoperable 
manner, using components as building blocks to support the contingency.  There are a variety 
of specialty modules that may be used to match the scenario’s requirements.  Additionally, 
personnel and equipment packages may be tailored, replicated, or combined with previously 
deployed UTCs to reach the desired capability. 
 
1.1.4.  The medical capability required at each bed-down location is determined by expected 
casualty rates, casualty types, population at risk (PAR), evacuation policy, evacuation delay, 
and evacuation distances.  Geographical positioning of medical capability, which minimizes 
the time from point of injury to treatment, is essential.  Medical planners must specifically 
consider requirements for the following when determining the proper medical support 
configuration for each bed-down location: emergency room, inpatient beds, operating room 
tables, intensive care beds, primary care, mental health, dental care, and patient 
transportation requirements.  Each of these factors varies, sometimes driving different 
requirements based on projected casualty rates.  Additionally, deployed medical facilities 
normally do not provide reconstructive surgery or rehabilitative services unless supporting a 
multinational force or humanitarian operation. 
 
1.1.5.  Components of the Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System are 
utilized to provide essential medical/dental care, deferring definitive care as dictated by 
theater medical concept of operations (CONOPS).  Fixed, mature AFTH facilities in 
supporting theaters receive patients from deployed medical facilities where essential 
medical/dental care has been rendered.  Mature AFTHs are defined as having a complete set 
6 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
of capabilities represented by specialty UTCs as well as deployable medical teams with their 
corresponding UTCs.  These mature AFTHs provide a robust capability much different than 
a 50-bed AFTH with no augmentation UTCs. 
 
1.2.  Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System. 
 
1.2.1.  The Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System is composed of UTC 
building blocks that provide personnel and equipment to meet specific operational 
requirements.  These UTCs enable the AFTH to expand in modules to meet the full spectrum 
of theater requirements to include significant specialty care (see Figure 1.1).  These 
capabilities will be utilized to provide essential care, deferring definitive care to the 
continental United States (CONUS) or supporting theaters. 
 
 
1.2.2.  The following comprise the Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System: 
 
1.2.2.1.  Squadron Medical Elements (SMEs).  SMEs provide limited outpatient care, 
clinical care, emergency medical care (trauma and cardiac stabilization), aerospace 
medicine support, and in-flight emergency coverage to deployed flying units in a myriad 
of operations with a PAR of 1-500.  SMEs collect, assess, and provide medical 
intelligence information and recommend strategies to the deployed commander to reduce 
and/or prevent aerospace, occupational, environmental, and public health risk factors 
from having a detrimental impact on mission effectiveness. 
 
1.2.2.2.  Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs).  The capabilities of IDMTs 
assigned to line units are very similar to those found in Module 1 of Expeditionary 
Medical Support (EMEDS) Basic, in that the IDMT provides aerospace medicine 
support, primary care, initial site survey, and limited environmental monitoring for water 
and food safety, field sanitation, pest/vector control, sewage, and heat stress to units in a 
myriad of operations with a PAR of 100-250. 
 
1.2.2.3.  EMEDS/AFTH.  The role of EMEDS/AFTH is to provide individual bed-down 
and theater-level medical services for deployed forces or select population groups within 
the entire spectrum of military operations.  EMEDS/AFTHs are modular packages by 
design and are tailored to meet theater commander in chief (CINC) requirements.  As the 
US Air Force provides timely and effective combat forces to combatant commanders in 
support of theater objectives, EMEDS/AFTHs support those operations by providing a 
modular and flexible theater hospitalization capability.  The EMEDS/AFTH is divided 
into three increments: EMEDS Basic, EMEDS+10 Bed AFTH, and EMEDS+25 Bed 
AFTH. 
 
1.2.2.3.1.  EMEDS Basic. 
 
 
1.2.2.3.1.1.  EMEDS Basic provides the operational support required to 
provide medical care in a myriad of operations with a PAR of 1-2000.  
EMEDS Basic is currently comprised of two modules. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001

1.2.2.3.1.1.1.  Module 1—Small Portable Expeditionary Aeromedical 
Rapid Response (SPEARR) team.  The leading edge of the EMEDS 
Basic is the SPEARR team.  The SPEARR team fits the definition of 
Level 2 (Casualty Collection and Forward Resuscitative Surgery) health 
service support (HSS) capability.  (See Attachment 2, Levels of Care, for 
definition.)  The SPEARR team provides a rapid response, extremely 
mobile, forward resuscitative, and preventive medicine and environmental 
health medical capability.  The team is deployable in two modes, 
completely man-portable or with a sling loadable (one pallet equivalent) 
trailer.  Supplies and equipment are extremely limited.  Prior to patient 
evacuation, it is essential that en route patient supplies and equipment are 
coordinated with aeromedical evacuation (AE) personnel. 
 
 
1.2.2.3.1.1.2.  Module 2.  Module 2 consists of additional personnel, 
supplies, and infrastructure.  These additional personnel augment the 
previously deployed SPEARR team.  Deployment of Module 2 is driven 
by mission requirements. 
 
 
1.2.2.3.1.2.  In total, EMEDS Basic provides Level 2 (Casualty Collection and 
Forward Resuscitative Surgery) capability.  Specifically, it provides forward 
stabilization, primary care, dental services, force health protection, and 
prepares patients for aeromedical evacuation.  EMEDS Basic has four holding 
beds.  Definitive medical/dental care is deferred to CONUS or supporting 
theaters.  EMEDS Basic deploys with 7 days of supplies.  Additional supply 
pallet UTCs can be deployed simultaneously or as needed to fit CINC 
operational requirements.  Equipment can be prepositioned or incrementally 
deployed.  Prior to patient evacuation, it is essential that en route patient 
supplies and equipment are coordinated with AE personnel.  
 
 
1.2.2.3.1.3.  EMEDS Basic must be supported by Expeditionary Combat 
Support (ECS) to be fully functional.  This support includes: appropriate 
vehicle of opportunity that can be converted to a patient transport vehicle (the 
EMEDS allowance standard [AS] includes supplies and equipment to modify 
the vehicle of opportunity); a 10K forklift; transportation to move [two 463L] 
pallets from airfield to field site; and an appropriate vehicle capable of towing 
a 6,000-pound trailer.  The sling loadable EMEDS Basic trailer is equipped 
with both military and commercial style hitches. 
 
1.2.2.3.2.  EMEDS+10 Bed AFTH and EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH.  EMEDS+10/25 
bed AFTH provides a Level 3 (Theater Hospital) HSS capability.  These enhanced 
clinical capabilities are historically found in a medical treatment facility (MTF) 
located in a lower-level threat environment.  These AFTHs are staffed and equipped 
to provide a high level of resuscitation, initial wound surgery, and post-operative 
treatment.  This level of care is the first step toward restoration of functional health, 
as compared to procedures that stabilize a condition to prolong life.

1.2.2.3.2.1.  EMEDS+10 provides medical/dental care in a myriad of 
operations with a PAR of 2000-3000.  Included in this capability are 10 
inpatient beds.  EMEDS+10 deploys with 7 days of supplies.  Equipment is 
either prepositioned or incrementally deployed.  Additional supply pallet 
UTCs can be deployed simultaneously or as needed to fit CINC operational 
requirements. 
 
1.2.2.3.2.2.  EMEDS+25 provides medical/dental care in a myriad of 
operations with a PAR of 3000-5000.  Included in this capability are 25 
inpatient beds (cumulative).  EMEDS+25 deploys with 7 days of supplies.  
Additional supply pallet UTCs can be deployed simultaneously or as needed 
to fit CINC operational requirements.  Equipment is either prepositioned or 
incrementally deployed.

1.3.  Chemical and Biological Threat.  Until collective protection for the EMEDS portion of 
the AFTH system is fielded, the EMEDS CONOPS assumes it will operate in a low chemical 
and biological warfare (CBW) threat environment.  Personnel required to staff decontamination 
(DECON) teams, patient retrieval teams, and biological assessment teams are not embedded in 
the EMEDS personnel matrix.  Higher threat scenarios will require additional specialized 
medical equipment as well as specially trained and equipped personnel (provided by medical 
nuclear, biological, and chemical [NBC] UTCs).

ORGANIZATIONS, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
2.1.  Air Force Surgeon General. 
 
2.1.1.  The Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) provides leadership and guidance to 
ensure a vital readiness posture is maintained through prevention oriented activities focused 
on population health and Air Force medicine.  The Surgeon General is responsible for 
coordinating and aligning health care programs and services to integrate with other Services 
and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD-HA).  This 
supports a Department of Defense (DOD) enterprise-wide health care system. 
 
2.1.2.  The office of the Air Force SG establishes policies to foster, advocate, and support 
research and development and equipment acquisition.  Additionally, the office of the Air 
Force SG establishes medical training guidelines; develops, coordinates, and publishes all 
program policy and readiness; and ensures the proper infrastructure and the appropriate mix 
of medical personnel are available. 
 
2.2.  Aerospace Expeditionary Force Center (AEFC). 
 
2.2.1.  The AEFC is a cross-functional, centralized management team designed to facilitate 
EAF operations that include AEF force package preparation for contingency steady state 
rotations and on-call aerospace expeditionary wing (AEW) operational requirements.  The 
AEFC works closely with the Air Staff, major commands (MAJCOMs), and Air Force 
components to integrate trained aerospace forces to meet theater CINC’s requirements across 
the full spectrum of operations.   
 
2.2.2.  The AEFC is a Chief of Staff, United States Air Force (CSAF)-designated authority 
and has direct liaison authorized (DIRLAUTH) across all MAJCOMs, Air Force 
components, and AEF/AEW scheduled units to provide readiness oversight and to integrate 
required planning and sourcing processes.  The AEFC does not have direct tasking authority.  
Tasking authority remains with MAJCOMs and Air Force components. 
 
2.2.3.  The AEFC provides continuity during crisis action planning, escalation to surge, or 
full-scale major theater war (MTW) operations.  The AEFC guides all aspects of AEF/AEW 
planning to include sourcing and scheduling forces (UTCs/individuals), refining the time-
phased force and deployment data (TPFDD), preparing the Deployment Requirements 
Manning Document (DRMD), assessing available forces, and monitoring unit readiness 
status. 
 
2.3.  Major Commands. 
 
2.3.1.  The Air Force organizes, trains, and equips air forces through MAJCOMs.  The 
MAJCOMs implement DOD, OASD-HA, CSAF and HQ USAF/SG policies.  They provide 
10 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
guidance and oversight for all readiness programs throughout their command.  The 
MAJCOMs provide forces to combatant commands for employment. 
 
2.3.2.  Each MAJCOM Surgeon General is responsible for planning and executing health 
services operations and training to support wartime or contingency operations.  Command 
Surgeons maintain Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) System 
responsibility for Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System UTCs assigned to 
their MAJCOM.  HQ Air Combat Command (ACC)/SG serves as the medical consultant for 
technical guidance and deliberate planning for AFMS contingency support operations.  
Component commands have responsibility for deliberate plans.  
 
2.4.  Deployed Medical Commander (DMC) or Senior Medical Officer (SMO). 
 
2.4.1.  The AEW commander has a medical group commander on staff.  The medical group 
commander is responsible for ensuring all health service assets are trained, equipped, and 
ready to support (a total or partial) wing deployment. 
 
2.4.2.  The wing/group/squadron commanders and the DMC/SMO are ultimately responsible 
for having the right personnel assigned, equipped, and trained to perform their assigned 
functions when deployed as part of an expeditionary medical support force package.  Prior to 
deployment, the deploying medical commander ensures agile combat support for deployed 
medical assets has been coordinated with appropriate units/agencies at the deployed location.

OPERATIONS 
 
3.1.  Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF). 
 
3.1.1.  An AEF is an organizational structure composed of force packages of capabilities that 
provide warfighting CINCs with rapid and responsive aerospace power.  These force 
packages, together with their support and command and control (C2) elements, are tailored to 
meet specific needs across the spectrum of response options and will deploy within an 
Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) as aerospace expeditionary wings (AEWs), 
groups (AEGs), or squadrons (AESs).  Medical UTCs assigned to an AEF deploy in 
accordance with (IAW) mission requirements. 
 
3.1.2.  Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System components deploy in 
various combinations to support a specific theater/regional population size, deployment 
scenario, and casualty rate (combat, disease and nonbattle injury [DNBI], and other).  
Personnel and equipment packages may be tailored, replicated, or combined with previously 
deployed UTCs to reach the desired capability effect.  This supports the philosophy of 
ensuring essential medical capability is on the first plane in and the last plane out.

3.1.3.  Figure 3.1 illustrates how we envision the military situation unfolding.  The “red 
wedge” ramp up phase corresponds with installation deployment and build-up activities.  It is 
during this period that military forces are at high risk for food/water/sanitation, DNBI, injury, 
industrial or occupational accidents, and terrorist attacks.  During sustained operations, the 
Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) should be in place. 
 
3.1.4.  Doctrinally, the AFMS will provide a tiered and tailored medical capability that is 
driven by mission, threat scenario, airlift availability, and population at risk.  The concept is 
to flow essential medical capability in on the first aircraft.  As the operation expands, and as 
airlift becomes available, additional medical capability is brought in, as required. 
 
12 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
3.1.4.1.  Medical Global Reach Laydown (MGRL) teams will deploy with air mobility 
forces (e.g., tanker airlift control elements [TALCEs]) in the early stages of a campaign 
to establish the air bridge and aerial ports of delivery in theater.  The MGRL teams 
consist of personnel and equipment required to provide medical care for injuries and 
illness and provide preventive medical care reducing risk of a catastrophic/detrimental 
event that could have an impact on mission effectiveness.  The team also recommends 
strategies to TALCEs and mobility support team (MST) commanders for 
countermeasures against environmental and physiological stressors, in order to enhance 
mission effectiveness.  Support is normally to deployed TALCE and MST operations and 
is under the operational control (OPCON) of HQ Air Mobility Command (AMC)/tanker 
airlift control center (TACC).  These assets usually deploy in advance of deployment 
forces and are normally withdrawn after deployed medical infrastructure is in place. 
 
3.1.4.2.  The SMEs and IDMTs may deploy with their assigned squadrons.  If deployed, 
they may be the first medics on the ground and the most forward deployed with or 
without their air transportable clinic (ATC). 
 
3.1.4.3.  The SPEARR team (EMEDS Basic Module 1) should arrive on the first aircraft.  
This 10-person team is capable of deploying within 2 hours of initial mission notification.  
This rapid response time is site specific and is a “best case” estimate for SPEARR team 
response.  The 2-hour response time is dependent on the collocation of personnel and 
equipment and on a team standing “on-call” (or “Bravo”) alert at all times.  EMEDS 
Basic Module 2 personnel and equipment depart with the bulk of the AEF or deployed 
force.  In certain contingency operations the entire EMEDS Basic package may deploy at 
the same time as a single unit.  Additional EMEDS/AFTH increments are deployed based 
on the CINC requirements.  (See Figure 1.1.) 
 
3.1.5.  The concept works in reverse for the other red wedge, the ramp down phase, which 
typifies installation redeployment activities.  Medical capability would ramp down at a 
similar rate as the installation taking into account the threat scenario and the population at 
risk, ensuring the availability of essential medical capability. 
 
3.2.  Deployment—Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) Modularization Capability. 
 
3.2.1.  Squadron Medical Elements (SMEs).  Each 3-member SME deploys with their 
assigned squadron to provide limited outpatient care, clinical care, emergency medical care 
(trauma and cardiac stabilization), aerospace medicine support, and in-flight emergency 
coverage to deployed flying units with a PAR of 1-500.  This team deploys with limited 
supplies and requires both a shelter (building of opportunity, tent, etc.) and a vehicle of 
opportunity (which is capable of transporting patients on litters and responding to in-flight 
emergencies).  Based on CINC requirements, an ATC may be deployed to support an SME.  
For a comprehensive description of SME capabilities refer to the SME CONOPS. 
 
3.2.2.  Air Transportable Clinic (ATC).  An air transportable clinic is one 463L pallet of 
equipment and supplies that can be prepositioned or deployed simultaneously with the SME 
to support deployed flying units with a PAR of 300-500.  A minimum of a 10K forklift will 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
13 
 
 
be needed to transport the pallet from the airfield to the designated site.  A comprehensive 
description of ATC capabilities is in the ATC CONOPS. 
 
3.2.3.  Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs).  IDMTs deploy with their 
assigned squadrons (e.g., RED HORSE, air control, reconnaissance, EMEDS/AFTH), as well 
as augment previously deployed medical assets.  They deploy to either fixed facilities or bare 
base sites.  When deployed to a bare base site, the IDMT will require both a vehicle and a 
shelter of opportunity to support a myriad of operations with a PAR of 100-250.  Based on 
CINC requirements, an ATC can be deployed to meet mission requirements.  A 
comprehensive description of IDMT missions, requirements, training, and other capabilities 
is in AFI 44-103, IDMT Program/Medical Support for Mobile Medical Units 
(MMUs)/Remote Sites. 
 
3.2.4.  EMEDS Basic (also referred to as EMEDS/AFTH 1st Increment).  EMEDS Basic 
is first of three increments of the EMEDS/AFTH system.  The 25 personnel, (which includes 
the 10-person SPEARR team) two 463L pallets of equipment, and one 6,000-pound trailer 
can be transported by one C-130 aircraft. 
 
3.2.4.1.  Module 1—SPEARR Team.  Module 1 is comprised of ten medics from four 
UTCs: the preventive aerospace medicine (PAM) advanced echelon (ADVON) team, the 
mobile field surgical team, the expeditionary critical care team, and the expanded 
capability and infrastructure module.  If the SPEARR team deploys in its man-portable 
mode they will require a shelter of opportunity to house patient care operations.  When 
the SPEARR team deploys with the expanded capability and infrastructure module, 
patient care tentage is included.  The expanded capability and infrastructure module is a 
6,000-pound, sling-loadable trailer that requires appropriate transportation to move it 
from the airfield to the field site.  Once at the contingency site, the SPEARR team 
requires at least one, preferably two, vehicles of opportunity that can be converted into 
patient transport vehicles. 
 
3.2.4.2.  Module 2.  Module 2 consists of the remaining 15 personnel assigned to the 
EMEDS Basic UTCs and two 463L pallets of supplies and infrastructure.  These teams 
arrive as various deployment scenarios dictate to augment the previously deployed 
SPEARR team.  Transportation requirements include a 10K forklift and appropriate 
vehicle to transport two 463L pallets from the airfield to the field site.  Patient 
transportation will be accomplished by utilizing the vehicle(s) of opportunity provided to 
Module 1. 
 
3.2.4.3.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) for EMEDS Basic.  FOC for EMEDS 
Basic is attained when facility and clinical functional areas (aerospace medicine, 
preventive medicine, dental, primary care, command and control, emergency care, critical 
care, and surgical capability) are fully established, normally within 12 hours.  As a 
minimum, the following ECS is required during this period: electrical/ground power 
equipment, communications, fuel and potable water delivery, transportation, security, fire

AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
comprehensive description of base operating support (BOS) requirements for EMEDS 
Basic refer to the EMEDS/AFTH CONOPS. 
 
3.2.5.  EMEDS+10 Bed AFTH (also referred to as EMEDS/AFTH 2nd Increment) and 
EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH (also referred to as EMEDS/AFTH 3rd Increment). 
 
3.2.5.1.  EMEDS+10 rapidly augments EMEDS Basic and provides 10 inpatient beds, 
which increases capacity and diagnostic capability but maintains a similar scope of care 
provided by EMEDS Basic.  The EMEDS+10 increment adds 31 people and 7 pallets of 
supplies and infrastructure, one water buffalo, and one ambulance.  For a comprehensive 
description of the EMEDS/AFTH 2nd increment capability and BOS requirements, refer 
to the EMEDS/AFTH CONOPS. 
 
3.2.5.2.  EMEDS+25 increases inpatient capacity to 25 beds as well as increasing the 
scope of care.  The EMEDS+25 increment adds 29 people and 4 pallets of supplies and 
infrastructure and an additional ambulance.  For a comprehensive description of the 
EMEDS/AFTH 3rd increment capability and BOS requirements, refer to the 
EMEDS/AFTH CONOPS. 
 
3.2.5.3.  Some theaters may require medical facilities with subspecialty care and large 
numbers of inpatient beds for locations where no host nation fixed facility support exists.  
In this case, it is possible to expand in-place resources with air transportable specialty 
modules to any capacity required to meet US Air Force/joint theater requirements. 
 
3.2.5.4.  The EMEDS+10 increment adds 31 people (for a total of 56 personnel) and 
seven 463L pallets of supplies and infrastructure, one water buffalo and one ambulance to 
the EMEDS Basic package.  Included in these 7 pallets are two 100-kilowatt mobile 
electric power (MEP-7) generators.  The EMEDS+25 increment adds another 29 people 
(for a total of 85 personnel), four 463L pallets of supplies, and infrastructure and one 
ambulance.  FOC for the 2nd and 3rd increments is expected within 24 hours following 
arrival at the employment location. 
 
3.2.5.5.  The entire SPEARR team through EMEDS+25 bed AFTH assemblage has 85-
personnel, thirteen 463L pallets, one 6,000-pound trailer, one water buffalo, and two 
ambulances.  The sling-loadable trailer and the water buffalo require a vehicle/aircraft of 
opportunity to move them from the flight line to the field site.  The trailer is equipped 
with both a military and a civilian style hitch. 
 
3.3.  Employment—Casualty Care and Management.  In general, casualties are transferred 
from the deployed location (from less capable facilities and from components at forward 
locations [e.g., special operations forces (SOF), ATCs]) to an EMEDS/AFTH facility and then to 
the next appropriate level of care (Attachment 2).  Further evacuation is determined by theater 
evacuation policies, i.e., casualties not likely to be returned to duty are evacuated IAW theater 
evacuation policy when stabilized.  A stabilized patient is defined as: airway secured, 
hemorrhage controlled, treated shock, and immobilized fractures. 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
15 
 
 
3.3.1.  Squadron Medical Elements (SME)―Scope of Care.  The SME provides limited 
outpatient care, clinical care, emergency medical care (trauma and cardiac stabilization), 
aerospace medicine support, and in-flight emergency coverage to deployed flying units in a 
myriad of operations with a PAR of 1-500.  SMEs collect, assess, and provide medical 
intelligence information.  They also recommend to the deployed commander strategies to 
reduce and/or prevent aerospace, occupational, environmental, and public health risk factors 
from having a detrimental impact on mission effectiveness.  ATCs provide only limited 
holding capability of less than 24 hours.  Timely and rapid aeromedical evacuation support is 
critical to mission success. 
 
3.3.2.  Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs)―Scope of Care. 
 
3.3.2.1.  The capabilities of IDMTs assigned to line units are very similar to those found 
in Module 1 of EMEDS Basic.  The main role of the IDMT is to provide aerospace 
medicine support, primary care, first aid, initial site survey, and limited environmental 
monitoring for water and food safety, field sanitation, pest/vector control, sewage, and 
heat stress to small (i.e., PAR of 300-500) deployed units at locations where a physician 
may not be available.  IDMTs may also be used as physician extenders. 
 
3.3.2.2.  IDMTs perform triage, initial airway management to include endotracheal 
intubation and cricothyroidotomy, control of hemorrhage, basic splinting without 
diagnostic imaging diagnosis, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and oral re-hydration, basic 
life support capabilities with limited advanced life support to include defibrillation and 
initial trauma stabilization to include chest tube placement and/or needle thoracentesis. 
 
3.3.2.3.  Patients requiring treatment beyond the capabilities of the IDMT and SME are 
transported to the nearest EMEDS/AFTH facility or local host medical treatment facility 
(HMTF) for further treatment and/or evacuation using organically assigned field 
ambulances or other vehicles of opportunity.  For a comprehensive description of IDMT 
missions, requirements, training, and other capabilities refer to AFI 44-103, IDMT 
Program/Medical Support for Mobile Medical Units (MMUs)/Remote Sites. 
 
3.3.3.  Small Portable Expeditionary Aeromedical Rapid Response (SPEARR) Team― 
Scope of Care. 
 
3.3.3.1.  The SPEARR team module is a highly mobile, rapid response team.  Medical 
capability includes advanced resuscitative procedures as well as management of acute 
and chronic medical problems to support a wide spectrum of military missions. 
 
3.3.3.2.  The mission of the SPEARR team is to provide force health protection for up to 
500 disaster or contingency support personnel, or a 500 PAR, for an initial period of 5 to 
7 days.  Sustainment or resupply capability (10-day resupply consistent with other 
EMEDS modules) ensures continued medical care and force health protection, when 
required.  The PAR may be comprised of all US military personnel or include a 
combination of international military and civilian personnel in a coalition operation. 
 
16 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
3.3.3.3.  The scope of care includes public health/preventive medicine, flight medicine, 
environmental health, primary care, emergency medicine, emergency surgery, 
perioperative care, critical care stabilization, patient preparation for aeromedical 
transport, and aeromedical evacuation coordination/communication.  The assumption is 
that the supported force will have received some form of predeployment health screening, 
immunizations, and disease prophylaxis appropriate to the theater of operations. 
 
 
3.3.4.  EMEDS Basic―Scope of Care. 
 
3.3.4.1.  EMEDS Basic provides 24-hour sick call and emergency medical/dental care 
that includes the following capabilities: medical C2, preventive medicine, trauma 
resuscitation and stabilization, limited general and orthopedic surgery, critical care, 
primary care, dental care, to include limited dental stabilization, aeromedical evacuation 
coordination, aerospace medicine, urgent care, and limited ancillary services to support 
deployment of 1-2000 AEF personnel or contingency/disaster support personnel.  The 
complete 25-person EMEDS Basic force package is capable of providing care for 7 days 
in an austere environment without resupply.  In most operations the PAR represents AEF 
personnel only.  For a comprehensive description of EMEDS Basic capabilities refer to 
the EMEDS/AFTH CONOPs. 
 
3.3.4.2.  EMEDS Basic does not have dedicated inpatient beds.  EMEDS Basic is 
equipped with 4 beds with a holding capacity of less than 24 hours, unless driven to 
short-term deviations by operational issues.  It is essential that urgent patients be 
evacuated within 12 hours of notification.  Patient movement within 24-hours for non-
urgent patients is critical to mission success.  Extremely limited blood storage exists: type 
O blood only, and there is limited capability for emergency blood collection/transfusion.  
For information on blood support operations, refer to AFTTP 3-42.8, Medical Logistics 
and Blood Support Operations. 
 
3.3.5.  EMEDS+10 Bed AFTH (also referred to as EMEDS/AFTH 2nd Increment)― 
Scope of Care.  This increment provides prevention, acute intervention, and primary care to 
support deployment of 2000-3000 worldwide-qualified personnel.  The 56-person 
EMEDS+10 bed AFTH force package is capable of providing medical/dental care for seven 
days in an austere environment without re-supply.  The PAR represents AEF personnel only.  
The 10 beds provide inpatient capability consistent with theater evacuation policy.  The core 
infrastructure provides additional ancillary support, medical equipment maintenance and 
facility management.  Extremely limited blood storage exists with a limited capability for 
emergency blood collection/transfusion. 
 
3.3.6.  EMEDS+25 Bed AFTH (also referred to as EMEDS/AFTH 3rd Increment)― 
Scope of Care.  This increment provides prevention, acute intervention, and primary care to 
support deployment of 3000-5000 worldwide-qualified personnel.  A 25-inpatient bed 
capability supports the theater evacuation policy and AFFOR Surgeon’s concept of 
operations.  EMEDS+25 bed AFTH provides the core infrastructure for specialty UTCs (e.g., 
critical care, gynecology, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, oral surgery, ophthalmology, 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
17 
 
 
thoracic/vascular surgery, urology, mental health rapid response, and combat stress 
management). 
 
3.4.  Redeployment and Reconstitution Phases. 
 
3.4.1.  Redeployment of Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System 
components mirrors the shrinking operation location/base population and base roll-up.  
Deployed medical personnel and equipment depart with the bulk of the AEF or deployed 
force.  The SPEARR team (EMEDS Basic, Module 1) maintains emergency medical and 
surgical capability up to 1 hour prior to their redeployment and departs on one of the last 
aircraft.  Resupply is coordinated through the sustaining base and Air Force Medical 
Logistics Operations Center (see AFTTP 3-42.8, Medical Logistics and Blood Support 
Operations for additional information).  The deployed system will be reconstituted prior to 
packing unless directed otherwise. 
 
3.4.2.  The SMEs and IDMTs redeploy with their assigned squadrons.  They are usually the 
last medics on the ground with or without their ATC.  Reconstitution occurs IAW the SME 
CONOPS. 
 
3.5.  Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Support in Humanitarian Operations. 
 
3.5.1.  The spectrum of medical support provided to humanitarian missions ranges from 
public health to subspecialty clinical care depending on the contingency.  When disasters 
occur, resources such as potable water, sanitation, nutrition, fuel, and shelters may be 
unavailable or in short supply during the emergency relief phase.  Due to the lack of these 
resources and overcrowded conditions, enteric diseases (diarrhea), upper respiratory tract 
infections, and vector borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, cholera, and typhoid 
may be common.  The demographics of a population displaced from war or natural disaster 
may include a larger percentage of the young and elderly and more women and children than 
the typical military active duty profile. 
 
3.5.2.  The SPEARR team serves as the basic building block for a modular approach to 
medical support in humanitarian missions.  The following UTCs designed to support MTWs 
also have applicability in humanitarian missions: primary care augmentation, gynecology 
augmentation, infectious disease, air transportable dental clinic, and pediatrics. 
 
3.6.  AFMS Support in Major Theater War (MTW). 
 
3.6.1.  The AFTH is augmented by several teams to provide the appropriate level of medical 
support at or above the 25-bed capacity.  Specialty and ancillary UTCs/teams are generally 
centralized at one to three mature theater hospitals in a theater.  Mature theater hospitals are 
normally 50 beds or greater with a full complement of medical specialty augmentation UTCs.  
Contingency-specific needs will drive deviations.  Specialty UTCs that may be centralized at 
mature theater hospitals include: gynecology augmentation, infectious disease, endodontic, 
periodontic, oral surgery, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, thoracic/vascular, 
CT scan, fluoroscopy, angiography, and ancillary teams. 
18 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
 
3.6.2.  Aeromedical Staging Facilities (ASFs).  ASFs support the aeromedical evacuation 
system.  They provide inpatient holding capability at AE transfer points.  Generally, 
command and control of ASFs falls within the C2 processes of AE units (refer to AFTTP 3-
42.5, Aeromedical Evacuation); however, C2 of fixed ASFs may fall under the operational 
control of the Air Force host wing through the medical commander. 
 
3.6.3.  Patient Movement.  Expeditionary battlefield philosophies have driven significant 
changes in medical support including minimized forward medical footprint, evacuation and 
replacement of patients, and transporting stabilized verses stable patients.  The requirement 
to move patients is a joint responsibility and in today’s environment, is even more critical to 
the health support system.  Patient evacuation can be by surface (land or water) or by air 
(rotary-wing, tilt-wing, or fixed-wing aircraft); however, air is preferred. 
 
3.6.3.1.  Several components of the Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support 
System can only provide essential care in theater.  Thus, timely and rapid patient 
movement support is critical to mission success.  For additional patient movement 
doctrine, reference Joint Publication 4-02.2, JTTP for Patient Movement in Joint 
Operations. 
 
3.6.3.2.  Patient Movement Coordination.  The patient movement process begins when 
a health care unit sends a request to the servicing Patient Movement Requirements Center 
(PMRC).  The PMRC evaluates the request, validates the requirement (addressing 
medical, operational, and administrative issues required to safely move a patient), 
identifies a potential destination(s), determines the mode of transportation, and assigns 
patient and equipment requirements to the appropriate Service transportation component.  
Patient movement may be executed using ships or rotary-wing, tilt-wing, or fixed-wing 
assets.  Sufficient and timely coordination with the PMRC, including medical supply 
and equipment requirements, is essential to ensure smooth patient movement. 
 
3.6.4.  Interface with the Air Force AE System.  When the PMRC identifies the Air Force 
as the Service transportation component, the AE cell within the airlift center will receive the 
requirement, review airlift options, collaborate with the PMRC, and determine the final lift 
decision based on overall requirements, availability, and priorities.  AE incrementalized 
elements are normally deployed in conjunction with the SPEARR team, EMEDS Basic, and 
AFTH, and provide coordination and staging capabilities for patients entering or transiting 
through the AE system.  For further guidance on the AE system, accessing the system, and 
patient preparation and medical considerations, refer to AFTTP 3-42.5, Aeromedical 
Evacuation.  Physician roles and responsibilities are outlined in AFJI 41-306, Physician’s 
Roles and Responsibilities in Aeromedical Evacuation (draft).

Chapter 4 
 
COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, AND COMPUTERS 
 
4.1.  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4).  C4 of medical operations 
in multinational or United Nations (UN) operations are defined in the warning, execution, and 
operations orders.  Service component planners establish medical requirements and relay them 
through existing tasking messages/mechanisms to MAJCOMs and wings. 
 
4.2.  Command and Control. 
 
4.2.1.  Unified Command Surgeon.  The Unified Command Surgeon establishes theater 
medical policy, requirements, and medical CONOPs and communicates these matters 
through the AFFOR Surgeon to the deployed medical units.  The chain of command for 
expeditionary medical units is through the Line of the Air Force (LAF). 
 
 
4.2.2.  Air Force Forces. 
 
4.2.2.1.  The Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) serves as the “single-voice” 
Air Force to the joint force commander.  The COMAFFOR is responsible for all Air 
Force forces (AFFOR) assigned or attached to the air component in joint or multinational 
operations.  The COMAFFOR employs and sustains assigned and attached AFFOR in-
theater. 
 
4.2.2.2.  A corps neutral, medical officer at the rank of colonel is a member of the 
COMAFFOR special staff and is the director of Air Force health services operations.  
This medical officer may be known as the AFFOR Surgeon and is responsible for 
overall health resources management and provides information on health surveillance and 
risk assessments, sustainment, and other force health protection issues.  The AFFOR 
Surgeon does not exercise command authority over deployed medical assets but provides 
a planning, coordinating, and oversight role. 
 
4.2.3.  Local Command Authority for Aerospace Expeditionary Wings (AEWs). 
 
4.2.3.1.  The AEW/AEG commander has administrative control of all assigned AEW 
assets.  The AEW/AEG commander may designate the deployed medical commander to 
serve as medical operations advisor to the wing or group staff.  When deployed, the 
EMEDS/AFTH falls under the AEW/AEG chain of command. 
 
4.2.3.2.  At each forward operating location (FOL), the deployed medical commander or 
senior medical officer reports to the AEW site commander within the chain of command.  
Deployed medical commanders may be granted G-Series orders at the discretion of the 
COMAFFOR or highest level to which OPCON is delegated.  Under full mobilization, 
full administrative control (ADCON) authority goes to the COMAFFOR.  Under less 
than full mobilization, the COMAFFOR may receive specified elements of ADCON, to 
include UCMJ authority, force protection requirements, and other specific authorities 
20 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
written in G-Series orders.  The Air Reserve Component (ARC) retains all other ADCON 
authorities. 
 
4.2.4.  Local Command Authority for Major Theater War (MTW).  The AEW/CC 
designates a medical group commander, usually the deployed medical commander.  The 
AFFOR Surgeon has coordinating authority with the DMC and/or SMO at all geographically 
separated sites.  However, chain of command remains through LAF channels. 
 
4.2.5.  Multinational Operations.  Command and control of medical operations in 
multinational or UN operations is defined in the warning/execution/operations order. 
 
4.3.  Communications. 
 
4.3.1.  Medical Reports and Communication.  All medical reports are submitted in 
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 10-206, Operational Reporting, and specific 
CINC, joint task force (JTF), and COMAFFOR guidance.  The MEDRED-C (RCS:HAF-
SGH(AR)8602) is a status report of medical operations readiness.  This report is 
accomplished daily and communicated to the AFFOR Surgeon, contributing MAJCOM 
Surgeons, and the Air Force Surgeon General.  For sustained operations, MEDRED-C may 
be required weekly with the concurrence of the AFFOR Surgeon. 
 
4.3.1.1.  The MEDRED-C is an on-site assessment of the deployed medical unit’s ability 
to perform its mission.  This report provides information on the operational readiness 
status, unit availability, and patient care activities of US Air Force Medical Service units 
on alert for contingency operations or are under the influence of an unusual occurrence 
(i.e., natural disaster or other emergencies). 
 
4.3.1.2.  Data is used to make operational decisions on medical support forces and to 
perform medical intelligence analyses during contingency operations.  Preventive 
medicine personnel will submit DNBI reports to the AFFOR Surgeon, contributing 
MAJCOM surgeons, and other locations as directed by the theater surgeon and Service 
policy.  Data will be used to identify, track, and minimize the impact of disease and 
nonbattle injury. 
 
4.3.1.3.  DNBI data will also be used for exposure tracking and record-keeping in 
accordance with DOD and Air Force policy.  This data may also be submitted to the US 
Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM), the Air 
Force Institute for Environmental Risk Analysis (AFIERA), or other specialized 
organization to meet theater surgeon preventive medicine requirements. 
 
4.3.2.  Secure/ Nonsecure Communications.  Any classified information must be 
transmitted by secure means.  Situation reports (SITREPs), MEDRED-Cs, medical 
surveillance, site locations, and compiled patient data are all examples of information that 
can be classified and will need safeguarding.  The types of secure communications 
equipment usually available include secure telephone unit (e.g., STU IIIs) and various other 
encryption devices.  Medical or casualty information becomes an operations security 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
21 
 
 
(OPSEC) issue when linked to a particular military mission or operation.  While medical 
information itself is not normally classified, in the context of a mission, it should be 
protected as part of the CINC’s overall OPSEC program to deny information to the enemy. 
 
4.3.3.  Telephones and Radios.  Secure/nonsecure telephones and radios are other 
communication devices used with EMEDS/AFTH.  Users must be familiar with the 
procedures and proper operation of telephone and radios prior to deployment.  The radio 
equipment is interoperable with a wide variety of DOD and commercial radios.  Use of these 
radio sets in operations outside the United States must be approved through the appropriate 
theater CINC. 
 
4.3.4.  Satellite Communications (SATCOM).  SATCOM assets are deployed with the 
EMEDS/AFTH force package.  Though satellite connectivity is the preferred connection, 
factors such as bandwidth availability and CINC priorities may dictate SATCOM usage.  
Theater deployable communications (TDC) provides other methods for theater 
communications.  In these cases the theater CINC may direct priorities.  Telemedicine, 
medical logistics support, video transmission, and electronic mail require SATCOM 
capability when there is no local area network (LAN)/wide-area network (WAN) 
connectivity or a TDC network.  Satellite communications may be military or commercial 
systems.  
 
4.3.5.  Classified Information.  Classified information that is not under the personal control 
and observation of an authorized person is to be guarded or stored in a locked security 
container.  A General Services Administration (GSA) approved field safe can be used.  
However, one- or two- drawer light containers must be securely fastened to the structure or 
under constant surveillance to prevent theft.  
 
4.4.  Systems. 
 
4.4.1.  Applicable Air Force C4 Policy.  Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-108, Compatibility, 
Interoperability, and Integration of C4 Systems, establishes guidance and responsibilities to 
ensure compatibility, interoperability, and integration for new and modified C4 systems, 
including automated information systems (AIS). 
 
4.4.2.  Network Management Policies.  AFI 33-115V1, Network Management, identifies 
responsibilities for supporting critical Air Force communications and information networks, 
primarily through Network Operations and Security Centers (NOSCs) and Network Control 
Centers (NCCs).  Air Force network management adheres to the Defense Information 
Infrastructure Control Concept (DIICC) consisting of areas of distributed responsibility at 
global, regional, and local levels. 
 
4.4.3.  Communications and Computer System Support.  Deployed medical assets utilize 
Air Force communications units, which provide base communications, voice, data 
infrastructure, and long-haul theater connectivity.  Communication requirements and 
frequency allocation issues must be coordinated prior to deployment.  Medical assets must 
deploy with dedicated computers and printers compatible with AEF infrastructure.  These 
22 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
computers should provide word processing, database management, store-forward 
telemedicine, telemaintenance, medical logistics support, message text formatting, graphics, 
and LAN/WAN interface capability (Figure 4.1).

4.4.4.  Communication Resources.  The communication systems and support equipment 
must be interoperable with the joint arena communications and frequency management 
operations.  Communication planners must coordinate frequency requirements through 
appropriate frequency management channels (e.g., installation, MAJCOM, and theater) to 
ensure all radiating equipment is spectrum certified and frequency supportable.  Also, host-
nation coordination must be initiated before a full-scale deployment.  Tactical radios and land 
mobile radios (LMRs) are normally deployed with medical units, for local use at the 
operational site. 
 
4.4.5.  Technology Utilization.  Telemedicine involves providing health care 
consultation services via electronic transmission of medical information.  
Telemedicine has several forms ranging from its most simple form involving a 
telephone call to a consultant to its most sophisticated form of real-time live video 
conferencing.  Telemedicine is split into two main forms. 
 
4.4.5.1.  Real-time Video Conferencing.  Real-time video conferencing is a 
sophisticated form of communication and uses video technologies for live, “real-
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
23 
 
 
time, face-to-face” interactions with others.  Generally, real-time video 
conferencing requires a large bandwidth to efficiently transmit and receive 
signals. 
 
4.4.5.2.  “Store and Forward” Information.  “Store and forward” information is 
a capability whereby clinical information including radiographs, photographs and 
other clinically related data are electronically transmitted from one computer to 
another in a manner similar to e-mail.  Of these two types, store and forward 
requires much less hardware and bandwidth to transmit the information and is 
ideal for nonemergent teleconsultation situations.  It simply becomes the 
electronic equivalent of a SF 513 (Medical Record – Consultation Sheet) with 
attached digitized photographs and radiographs. 
 
4.4.6.  Organic Communications Equipment. 
 
4.4.6.1.  The EMEDS/AFTH facility is equipped with organic communications 
equipment (SATCOM and tactical radios).  Prior to deployment, medical units should 
ensure EMEDS/AFTH organic communication and computer systems are compatible 
with deployed forces’ communication and computer systems.  EMEDS Basic, 
EMEDS+10/25 bed AFTH LAN configurations are included in the organic equipment 
package.  The MEFPAK Surgeon for each Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground 
Support System UTC establishes and maintains a summary of all required deployable 
communications systems and line-of-business software applications.  The summary may 
include specific information for bandwidth requirements, transmission control protocol 
(TCP) port utilization, external communication interfaces with associated Internet 
protocol (IP) addresses, time of day utilization cycles, restoration priorities, etc.  Voice 
and data communications links are vital for sustaining command and control, medical 
logistics support, patient movement data, and general message traffic capabilities. 
 
4.4.6.2.  EMEDS/AFTH deploys with organic satellite communications capability.  
Tactical and satellite communication sets or radios are allocated IAW the allowance 
standard and individual contingency operational considerations.  EMEDS/AFTH requires 
ECS for deployed NCC functionality, supplying networking core services (e.g., WAN 
network access, information protection, NOS domain architecture, and TCP/IP 
addressing).  Other deployed elements may provide alternate sources of communications 
in the event EMEDS/AFTH primary communications become inoperable. 
 
4.5.  Intelligence, National Agencies, and Space Support. 
 
4.5.1.  Intelligence. 
 
4.5.1.1.  Accurate medical intelligence is crucial to threat identification and 
application of appropriate preventive medicine measures.  Prior to deployment, units, 
groups, and/or individuals tasked to support an operation require deployment 
briefings in accordance with AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training, 
and AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning, for the area of responsibility (AOR).  During 
24 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
the employment stage of an operation, medical personnel require periodic briefings 
for their deployed location and for areas they are transiting while conducting medical 
operations. 
 
4.5.1.2.  The public health specialist (either the public health officer or 
noncommissioned officer [NCO]) serves as the Medical Intelligence Officer (MIO) to 
the deployed medical commander.  The MIO is the main focal point for collection 
and dissemination of medical intelligence.  The AFFOR Surgeon is responsible to 
ensure periodic medical and environmental intelligence updates are provided to all 
assigned units.  Wing and group commanders, IAW operational directives, coordinate 
communication of medical intelligence information. 
 
4.5.2.  National Agencies.  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Armed Forces 
Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC) are primary sources for current medical intelligence.  
In a deployed environment the AFFOR Surgeon is the primary source for theater/regional 
medical intelligence. 
 
4.5.3.  Space Support.  Space-derived intelligence, weather updates, and troop movements 
are examples of valuable information that are primarily acquired through base support 
units/organizations.  Accurate medical intelligence is crucial to threat identification and 
application of appropriate preventive medicine measures.  The AFFOR Surgeon is 
responsible for ensuring assigned units receive periodic medical /environmental intelligence 
updates.  Space-based communication systems, linked with terrestrial C2 systems, give the 
theater surgeon and deployed medical commander the ability to more effectively and 
efficiently direct, monitor, and employ the deployed medical forces and resources.  C2 
systems such as the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the Global Combat 
Support System (GCSS) are key to successfully directing, monitoring, and employing 
deployed medical forces.

Chapter 5 
 
PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
 
5.1.  Force Integration and Interoperability.  Integration and interoperability of deployed 
assets in a theater or area of operation are critical for successful medical operations.  Given that 
potential Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System deployments include the full 
spectrum of deployed scenarios, it is essential that medical integration and interoperability occur 
with line elements of an AEF, components of the aeromedical evacuation system, joint medical 
counterparts, SOF medical components, and other federal and civilian support systems.  
Integration with the line is particularly critical for ECS and aeromedical evacuation. 
 
5.2.  Integration and Interoperability With Other Systems. 
 
5.2.1.  ECS requirements are significant and critical to delivery of health care support 
services.  ECS requirements include, but are not limited to: messing, water, ice, fuels, 
billeting, latrines, showers, laundry, mortuary affairs, public affairs, chaplain, linguist, waste 
management, transportation (to include ambulance-type vehicles), vehicle maintenance 
support, vehicle decontamination, equipment maintenance, general supplies, contracting, 
information and communications systems support and maintenance, personnel 
decontamination, and security. 
 
5.2.2.  Support may be provided using HARVEST EAGLE or HARVEST FALCON, Air 
Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) or commercial assets.  In contaminated 
environments, base support may be required for decontamination of deployed medical 
facility infrastructure and vehicles to include decontamination of the site location when 
necessary. 
 
5.3.  Medical Planners.  Theater medical planners in coordination with the supporting command 
will integrate medical and AE elements to provide intra/ intertheater AE support to Aerospance 
Medical Contingency Ground Support Systems.  AE assets may be collocated with components 
of the this ground support system and include AE crewmembers (AECMs), Critical Care Air 
Transport Teams (CCATTs), AE Liaison Teams (AELTs), Mobile Aeromedical Staging 
Facilities (MASFs), and fixed ASFs.  The AE system is described in the AMC Omnibus Plan, 
the AE CONOPS, and AFTTP 3-42.5, Aeromedical Evacuation.  Theater medical planners will 
receive support and planning guidance from AMC, ANG, and AFRC. 
 
5.3.1.  Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC). 
 
5.3.1.1.  The TPMRC is the single responsible agent in their respective theater or AOR 
for collaborative patient movement planning, management, and in-transit visibility.  The 
PMRC evaluates patient movement requests (PMR), validates the requirement 
(addressing medical, operational, and administrative issues required to safely move the 
patient), identifies a potential destination(s), determines the mode of transportation, and 
assigns patient and equipment requirements to the appropriate Service transportation 
component.  TPMRCs have the authority to ensure lift and bed requirements are 
26 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
communicated to supporting agencies, healthcare facilities, and government agencies 
within their AOR. 
 
5.3.1.2.  Deployed medical assets must submit a PMR to the TPMRC in accordance with 
prescribed procedures using available communications support systems.  When a 
TPMRC is not available in-theater, PMRs are submitted IAW theater policy.  Aerospace 
Medical Contingency Ground Support System personnel should contact the TPMRC to 
request both intra and intertheater patient movement. 
 
5.3.2.  Global Patient Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC).  The GPMRC 
provides intertheater medical regulating services.  In certain contingencies, Aerospace 
Medical Contingency Ground Support System personnel may have to coordinate directly 
with the GPMRC for patient regulation and evacuation. 
 
5.3.3.  Special Operations Forces (SOF) Medical Support.  Air Force Special Operations 
Command (AFSOC) is designated as an “AEF enabler.”  AFSOC capability to support this 
role includes Level 1 (First Responder) and limited Level 2 (Casualty Collection and 
Forward Resuscitative Surgery) medical support, which is primarily aligned with AFSOC 
operational units.  Unique personnel and equipment packages are designed to support 
worldwide special operations, including far-forward missions.  In an “AEF enabler” role, 
these SOF assets interface and/or integrate with LAF and conventional medical and 
aeromedical elements, as well as joint SOF medical support components.  Details of SOF 
operational medical support are provided in AFTTP 3-42.6, USAF Medical Support for 
Special Operations Forces (SOF), and the AFSOC Medical CONOPs. 
 
5.4.  Security, Medical Resource Protection, and Medical Logistics. 
 
5.4.1.  Medical personnel and equipment are noncombatant assets.  Security within the 
immediate area for patients and personnel resources at each deployed medical site, with the 
exception of enemy prisoner of war (EPW) patients, is a medical responsibility.  Medical 
personnel are issued small arms IAW AFI 32-207, Arming and Use of Force.  Deployed 
medical site assets, such as narcotics, are protected as a controlled area in accordance with 
AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program.  Additional force protection 
measures should be determined by the DMC or SMO based upon terrorist force protection 
condition (FPCON) and the advice of the Defense Force Commander (DFC). 
 
5.4.2.  Medical Logistics.  Medical logistics personnel in concert with LAF and medical 
planners provide insight into when, where, what, how much, at what rate, and for how long, 
WRM is required.  WRM equipment may be prepositioned or incrementally deployed to 
ensure adequate materiel is available or on-hand.  Logistics objectives are to reduce the 
physical footprint and airlift requirement without degrading medical capability and to 
provide the right materiel and a tailored logistics support system to ensure responsive 
sustainment.  EMEDS/AFTH increments initially contain 7 days of supplies.  A limited item 
10-day resupply package is available as either a “push” or “pull” asset.  Fully integrated 
material acquisitions, status, flow, and transportation information is required.  A highly 
automated and integrated logistic system is used to manage high-velocity logistics.  
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
27 
 
 
Additional information on logistics support and processes can be found in AFTTP 3-42.8, 
Medical Logistics and Blood Support Operations. 
 
5.4.3.  Medical Storage Requirements.  EMEDS/AFTH assets are stored in a ready mode 
for rapid deployment.  Modules may be stored at one location or maintained/sourced from 
other locations.  At both home station and the deployed site, medical assets must be stored in 
facilities that provide security and a climate-controlled environment that prevents 
degradation to dated and temperature sensitive assets.  All surgical instruments/trays should 
be stored in a ready to use condition (sterilized and packaged). 
 
5.4.4.  Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) Requirements.  Once delivered to an 
operational site, the medical staff will erect each increment of the EMEDS/AFTH and attain 
full operational status.  Base support personnel will be needed to connect the EMEDS/AFTH 
to the base infrastructure.  ECS support for patients and deployed medical staff will be 
provided using host base capabilities. 
 
5.4.4.1.  The DMC or SMO must assure expeditionary combat support arrangements are 
coordinated with appropriate agencies prior to deployment.  Other base support service 
requirements include, but are not limited to; transportation (for up to 13- 463L pallets, a 
6,000-pound trailer, personnel, and patients until the ambulance arrives) contracting, 
billeting, food service, general supplies, sewage and waste disposal, potable water, 
laundry, fire protection, transportation, vehicle maintenance, and communications, 
including radio maintenance.  
 
5.4.4.2.  Pending arrival and set-up of deployed medical facilities, the bare base should 
provide a shelter of opportunity for interim use. 
 
 
5.4.4.2.1.  Bare base electrical power systems provide prime and backup power for 
EMEDS/AFTH facilities and equipment.  Initial support will be provided using low 
voltage tactical mobile power generators, e.g., MEP-7.  High voltage primary power will 
be provided once installed, and the tactical generators allocated for emergency backup 
power.  Ground power equipment specialists will be provided to connect power 
distribution panels (PDPs) to commercial or bare base power.  Field deployable 
environmental control units (FDECUs) are embedded in the EMEDS AS.  [See the 
EMEDS Basic and EMEDS+10/25 bed AFTH Power Grid Configurations in the EMEDS 
CONOPS.]  Ground fuels support will normally be obtained on a contract basis.  Fuels 
for EMEDS/AFTH vehicles, generators, etc., should be included with other base 
requirements. 
 
 
5.4.4.2.2.  Liquid oxygen (LOX) and other gases should be included in base 
requirements and should be obtained from fuels or on a contract basis. 
 
 
5.4.4.2.3.  The EMEDS CONOPS provides a descriptive list of EMEDS/AFTH 
ECS requirements.  Operations involving SPEARR team deployments may require a 
different mix of ECS.  The SPEARR team, with the trailer, is equipped to supply its own 
28 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
power, food, communications, and shelter for 5 days.  The list of SPEARR team ECS 
requirements is listed in the SPEARR CONOPS.

Chapter 6 
 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
 
6.1.  Education Programs. 
 
6.1.1.  Education programs must retain the flexibility to quickly adapt to emerging concepts 
and ideas.  Within the dynamic global security environment education programs must remain 
relevant.  Education programs that remain entrenched in out-of-date concepts do not 
adequately prepare individuals to cope with changing environments and lose credibility 
within the institution and with individuals.  Education programs must improve the airman’s 
contribution across the full range of military operations. 
 
6.1.2.  Education programs built around realistic scenarios and which demand decision 
making within realistic time frames serve to increase the educational effect.  This is achieved 
through dynamic curricula that anticipate the evolving security environment.  Education 
programs involving the full range of aerospace power capabilities within a wide range of 
military operations provide a comprehensive educational experience (AFDD 2.4.3, Education 
and Training). 
 
6.1.3.  Education programs should never be designed haphazardly.  Careful consideration 
must be given to the desired outcome of the program.  While no two programs will be alike, 
there are some common aspects that should always be considered.  The benefit of education 
programs can be maximized through: flexibility to adapt educational objectives to emerging 
concepts and ideas; versatility to encompass the full range of military operations in education 
programs; priority on relevant concepts through objective evaluation, feedback and input; 
balance between academic concept, operational reality, and historical perspective; and 
centralized development of education programs through a systematic approach involving 
mentally challenging, realistic educational goals. 
 
6.2.  Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS)/AFTH Training. 
 
6.2.1.  Ready-to-deploy, trained, medical personnel assigned to an EMEDS UTC are defined 
as having completed the following: 
 
6.2.1.1.  Formal EMEDS/AFTH specific medical field operational training (taught at 
USAF School of Aerospace Medicine [USAFSAM] at Brooks AFB, Texas). 
 
6.2.1.2.  Completion of the medical Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP), 
which defines Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) specific readiness skills. 
 
6.2.1.3.  Advanced trauma/critical care clinical training (for selected personnel) at a 
Center for Readiness Skills Training. 
 
6.2.1.4.  Other training requirements as stipulated by AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness 
Planning and Training. 
30 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
 
6.2.2.  Education and training need to be conducted in an environment that permits the 
personnel assigned to the modules of EMEDS/AFTH to exercise simultaneously using the 
skills/knowledge they already possess with the actual equipment and supplies in the 
EMEDS/AFTH modules.  Educating and training together permits personnel to learn and 
perform the duties of other team members. 
 
6.2.3.  The idea of cross-functionality becomes reality and engenders the capability of a 
commander to move personnel in and between the modules for those circumstances where 
membership has to be reconstituted because of illness, temporary duty (TDY), leave, or 
administrative actions.  Familiarity with the operation of the SPEARR, EMEDS Basic, and 
EMEDS+10/25 bed modules while these modules train together strengthens a person’s 
understanding of the concept of operations and their personal capability to deploy regardless 
of the original assignment to a specific module. 
 
6.2.4.  In garrison, the medical group (MDG)/CC is responsible for ensuring all training is 
completed and properly documented.  Training documentation is maintained within the unit 
Medical Readiness Office while at home station.  The Medical Readiness Office is 
responsible for reporting the training statistics to their parent MAJCOM using the MAJCOM 
prescribed format. 
 
6.2.5.  When deployed, the DMC should appoint an individual who will ensure education and 
training continues IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training, and that the 
training is appropriately documented in the medical readiness training record.  Air Reserve 
Component (ARC) EMEDS/AFTH UTCs not sourced against AEFs will meet formal UTC 
training requirements IAW 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training.  When ARC 
personnel are unable to attend formal training (due to scheduling difficulty) with their 
assigned units as a complete unit, they can attend training with other units. 
 
6.2.6.  EMEDS/AFTH UTC training is based on three 15-month cycles (Figure 6.1).  Team 
training consists of three training elements: a formal element, centralized at one site for 
standardization; a practical follow-on element, designed to provide a team exercise 
experience; and a sustainment element, completed at home station.  The formal element 
consists of the EMEDS formal course.  This training occurs during the first 15-month cycle 
but no later than 30 days prior to deployment vulnerability.  The practical element is 
conducted during the second or third 15-month cycle.  The third element, sustainment 
training, should be continuous throughout the three cycles.

6.2.6.1.  Formal Training. 
 
6.2.6.1.1.  EMEDS/AFTH training is implemented on a 15-month training cycle, 
alternating the formal EMEDS/AFTH course with practical training, based on the 
AEF rotation schedule.  The in-residence formal training is required for all 
EMEDS/AFTH teams every 45 months.  Formal SPEARR team training is 
included in the formal EMEDS curriculum requirements.  Attending the 
EMEDS/AFTH formal course provides full credit for continuing medical 
readiness training (CMRT).  Unit/team integrity is maintained to the maximum 
extent possible.  Assigned personnel must be flexible in what they are trained to 
do, to include multifunctional roles within the EMEDS/AFTH teams.  Course 
C4A or an equivalent course is required for the EMEDS/AFTH commander and 
deputy commander. 
 
6.2.6.1.2.  Upon completion of EMEDS/AFTH formal training, each team 
member is issued an AF Form 1098, Task Certification, documenting all training 
received to include those additional sustainment elements from AFI 41-106, 
Medical Readiness Planning and Training, Attachment 3.  The incorporation of 
expeditionary medical support concepts is included in all formal medical 
readiness training (i.e., Expeditionary Medical Readiness Course [EMRC]/Basic 
Expeditionary Medical Readiness Training [BEMRT], Combat Readiness 
Training Center [CRTC] - ANG Medical Readiness Training Site [MRTS], 
Reserve Medical Readiness Field Training [RMRFT], and Medical Readiness 
Indoctrination Course).  These formal courses serve as EMEDS/AFTH training 
platforms beyond the EMEDS/AFTH formal course. 
 
6.2.6.2.  Practical Training.  Practical training gives the EMEDS/AFTH teams an 
opportunity to reinforce the skills taught during the formal course.  EMEDS/AFTH 
practical training will take advantage of these opportunities to integrate and train with all 
EMEDS/AFTH increments in an exercise based format.  EMEDS/AFTH training should 
also take advantage of deployment and joint exercises.  As with formal training, the 
practical training will be documented on an AF Form 1098, Task Certification. 
32 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
 
6.2.6.3.  Sustainment Training. 
 
6.2.6.3.1.  Sustainment training consists of AFSC-specific activity and training 
events that enhance and maintain a team member’s operational skills.  These 
events can include any formal courses (i.e., advanced trauma life support [ATLS], 
advanced cardiac life support [ACLS], Trauma Nursing Core Course, etc.) and 
exercises where the Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support System 
concept is deployed.  Sustainment instruction is expected throughout each training 
cycle.  Units collocated with Aerospace Medical Contingency Ground Support 
System equipment sets are required to set up, inventory, and exercise the set 
annually.  Additional training is conducted IAW DODI 1322.24, Military Medical 
Readiness Skills Training, AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and 
Training, and AFSC-specific training (core competencies).  AFSC-specific 
training will focus primarily on the AFSC position filled within that UTC.  
Additionally, each team member must be familiar with multifunctional roles. 
 
6.2.6.3.2.  Sustainment training may also include clinical training received 
through initiatives such as the Center of Readiness Skills Training (i.e., Ben Taub 
Medical Center or Jefferson Barracks experiences, or equivalents).  The purpose 
of the Center of Readiness Skills Training is to train at a high-volume, civilian 
trauma center IAW the clinical requirements specified in the RSVP.  Like the 
formal training, unit/team integrity is vital to this experience.  Clinical 
sustainment training provides a focused experience that supports the provision of 
total medical support for a patient, potentially from point of injury through 
disposition, while deployed.

LEVELS OF CARE 
 
A1.1.  The Health Service Support (HSS) System.  The HSS system consists of five levels of 
care.  Patients are transported through various modes between these levels.  These levels, and the 
increasing degree of medical capabilities, are defined below.  Patient movement forward of 
Level 3 is a Service responsibility, but if operationally directed, AE may be tasked to go as far 
forward as there is a suitable airstrip. 
 
A1.2.  Levels of Care. 
 
A1.2.1.  Level 1 (L1)—First Responder.  Level 1 care consists of care rendered at the unit 
level.  It includes self-aid, buddy aid, combat lifesaver skills, examination, and emergency 
lifesaving measures such as the maintenance of the airway, control of bleeding, prevention 
and control of shock, splinting or immobilizing fractures, and prevention of further injury.  
Treatment may include restoration of the airway by invasive procedure; use of intravenous 
(IV) fluids and antibiotics; and application of splints and bandages.  These elements of 
medical management prepare patients for return to duty (RTD) or for transportation to a 
higher level of care. 
 
A1.2.2.  Level 2 (L2)—Casualty Collection and Forward Resuscitative Surgery.  Level 2 
care, at a minimum, includes resuscitation and stabilization and may include advance trauma 
management, emergency medical procedures, forward resuscitative surgery capability, basic 
laboratory, limited x-ray, pharmacy, and temporary holding facilities.  Patients are treated and 
returned to duty, or are stabilized for evacuation to an MTF capable of providing a higher 
level of care. 
 
A1.2.3.  Level 3 (L3)—Theater Hospital—EMEDS+10/25 Bed AFTH.  Level 3 care 
includes clinical capabilities normally found in an MTF that is located in a lower-level enemy 
threat environment.  The MTF is staffed and equipped to provide resuscitation, initial wound 
surgery, and post-operative treatment.  This level of care may be the first step toward 
restoration of functional health, as compared to procedures that stabilize a condition to 
prolong life.  It does not normally have the crisis aspects of initial resuscitative care and can 
proceed with greater preparation and deliberation. 
 
A1.2.4.  Level 4 (L4)—Mature Theater Hospital—EMEDS+50 Bed AFTH and Up.  
Level 4 care provides the surgical capabilities found at Level 3 and also provides 
rehabilitative and recovery therapy for those who can RTD within the theater evacuation 
policy.  This level of care may only be available in mature theaters.  The mature theater 
hospital may be an outside the continental United States (OCONUS) fixed medical treatment 
facility. 
 
A1.2.5.  Level 5 (L5)—Definitive Care—Large Fixed Facility CONUS or CINC-
Approved Safe Haven.  Level 5 care is definitive, convalescent, restorative, and 
rehabilitative and is normally provided by military, Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA), 
38 
 
AFTTP 3-42.7  24 AUGUST 2001 
 
 
CONUS civilian hospitals, and CINC-approved safe havens.  This level may include a period 
of minimal care but with increased physical activity necessary to restore patients to functional 
health and allow them to RTD or to a useful and productive life.
