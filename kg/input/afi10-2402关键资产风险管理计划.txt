Critical Asset Risk Management 
 
Current guidance in Air Force Instruction 10-2402, Critical Asset Risk Management Program, 
remains in effect with the following changes: 
 
(CHANGED) 2.18.3. IMSC PSU, the Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC), will conduct 
Air Force MAAs only when authorized in writing by AF/A3 and in accordance with the Joint 
Staff integrated assessment schedule.  
 
(CHANGED) 3.3.1. The CARM Program utilizes products from three separate assessments to 
determine risk to AF TCAs and develop risk management strategies. The three assessments are 
1) Balanced Survivability Assessments (BSA), 2) Joint Mission Assurance Assessments (JMAA) 
conducted by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and 3) Air Force Mission 
Assurance Assessments (AFMAA). 
 
(DELETED) 3.3.4.1. While the JMAAs are conducted by DTRA, AFMAAs are coordinated and 
executed by the AFSFC. The annual schedule of AFMAAs are developed by AFSFC in 
coordination with AF/A3OA with primary consideration of the assessment requirements dictated 
by AF Mission Assurance and Antiterrorism programs. These timelines are established by The 
Deputy Secretary of Defense Mission Assurance Assessment Program Interim Implementation 
Memo and the AT Program Instruction DODI O-2000.16, V1.

Chapter 1 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Executive Summary 
1.1.1.  The CARM Program was established to increase the reliability of assets/capabilities 
essential to the execution of DoD missions worldwide.  The CARM program enables 
continuity in two ways: 1) by identifying those systems and assets on which AF missions rely 
for functionality, and 2) then implementing a risk management strategy designed to reduce or 
offset the risk of loss to these TCA/ systems/capabilities.  The CARM risk management 
approach includes four macro processes (identify, assess, analyze, and manage mission risk) 
which seek to introduce mitigation and remediation measures across its capabilities to 
increase mission resiliency. 
1.1.2.  The Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP), outlined in DoDM 3020.45 V1, 
Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP): DoD Mission-Based Critical Asset 
Identification Process (CAIP), is designed to be conducted across the DoD on a 3-year cycle 
or when there is a change in assigned missions or capabilities.  The process begins at the 
mission owner level and then works downward through the AF structure.  Assessment and 
analytical products identify threats and hazards to TCAs and provide leadership with courses 
of action (COA) to reduce or offset risk.  These products contribute to risk decisions at the 
HAF, CCMD, MAJCOM/DRU, FOA, and Joint Staff (JS) levels. 
1.1.3.  The CARM program seeks to reduce risk by providing information to AF senior 
leadership (to include the Acquisitions and Sustainment communities), thus optimizing 
decisions on the allocation of remediation resources and future asset investment planning.  
Many AF Mission Assurance (MA) programs have overlapping responsibilities and focus 
areas.  Coordination and information sharing among these programs multiplies the impact of 
each organization and increases the return on investment of expended resources.  The CARM 
program seeks to maximize situational awareness and coordination at all levels of the AF 
structure, and acts to integrate CARM priorities and products within these communities. 
1.2.  Program Objectives 
1.2.1.  To ensure AF capabilities, functions, and missions can be executed globally via 
identifying those systems, assets, and infrastructure dependencies whose loss or degradation 
would negatively impact mission execution. 
1.2.2.  To establish and implement a risk management program for systems and assets critical 
to the execution of AF missions. 
1.2.3.  To define responsibilities, procedures, and standards so commanders can identify, 
validate, and prioritize TCAs and assess and manage risk to these TCAs in all threats/hazards 
environment. 
1.2.4.  Create a comprehensive and coordinated enterprise-wide approach to identify, assess, 
analyze, and manage risk for AF Tier 1 and Tier 2 TCAs.  TCA tier definitions can be found 
in section 3.2.5. 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
5 
1.2.5.  In conjunction with security-related and other risk management activities, advocate for 
action to protect and secure TCAs through a comprehensive risk management program. 
1.2.6.  Foster collaboration and integrate CARM program guidance, procedures, and 
capabilities into the overarching disciplines, planning tools, products and processes of other 
risk management programs.  This includes establishing information sharing capabilities as 
captured within the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process, and in accordance with 
the classification statutes outlined in DoDM 3020.45, V3. 
1.2.7.  Establish partnerships with other services, federal, state and local governments, host 
nations and the private sector to address CARM Program issues and inter-dependencies. 
1.2.8.  Synchronize assessment, mitigation, and remediation efforts with other AF MA 
programs.  A list of MA programs can be found in section 1.4.1. 
1.3.  Scope 
1.3.1.  CARM program responsibilities extend to any AF organization with assigned 
missions and required capabilities.  All MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs that are responsible for 
TCAs (as appropriate) will establish CARM programs charged with performing risk 
management to TCAs and direct subordinate organizations to execute CARM responsibilities 
as necessary.  Exemptions may be granted to installations with a demonstrated absence of 
DCI. 
1.4.  CARM and MA Integration Strategy 
1.4.1.  DoDD 3020.40 provides guidance for the integration and synchronization of DoD risk 
management programs, to include CARM.  CARM programs will implement and execute 
CARM guidance and requirements within the overall DoD MA Strategy and Framework by 
establishing complementary partnerships and information cross-flows between the CARM 
program and AF MA efforts as needed.  Designated MA programs/activities, as defined in

Chapter 3 
CARM PROCESSES 
3.1.  The CARM Cycle. 
3.1.1.  The CARM Cycle performs risk management through a macro four-step process 
which informs senior leaders and justifies resources for risk remediation or mitigation efforts.  
The process begins with the identification of assets critical to the execution of DoD missions, 
which are then assessed to measure criticality and identify vulnerabilities and threats/hazards.  
Assessment findings are analyzed to calculate risk to the mission/asset and reported to the 
MAJCOM/DRUs, FOAs, and the JS, along with recommended COAs to reduce risk to the 
asset and mission.  The process concludes when the AF manages the risk to the asset through 
the implementation of one or more of the recommended COAs in order to remediate or 
mitigate the risk. 
3.2.  Identification of TCAs. 
3.2.1.  Identification of TCAs ensures MAJCOM/DRUs; FOAs; and Installation 
Commanders and CARM program POCs maintain situational and operational awareness of 
risk to systems/assets critical to the execution of DoD missions. 
3.2.2.  Asset identification facilitates resourcing opportunities by identifying, analyzing, 
documenting, and validating the core system and asset requirements of the AF Enterprise.  
Requirements are entered by MAJCOM/DRUs, FOAs (as appropriate), or the AF Corporate 
Process into the AF baseline budget generated by the PPBE to execute assigned missions, 
functions, and capabilities at acceptable levels under the required conditions. 
3.2.3.  The CAIP, utilized by the DoD and the AF, identifies, nominates, validates, and 
analyzes TCAs and systems based on mission impact.  The CAIP is a nine-step process 
executed over a time frame determined by the JS.  A detailed breakdown of the CAIP steps 
and processes can be found in DoDM 3020.45 V1.  A quick reference chart of the steps and 
process overview can be found in Attachment 2. 
3.2.4.  CARM programs will perform the CAIP, as described in DoDM 3020.45 V1, by 
identifying TCAs defined by this AFI, internal and external to DoD installation boundaries.  
For the purposes of this Instruction, the term TCA encompasses both Task Critical Assets 
(TCA) and critical assets formerly known as SICAs.  Once an asset is determined to be 
critical, it is assigned a tier rating based on the level of impact its loss would inflict on the 
mission it supports. 
3.2.5.  CARM program tier definitions are below and in compliance with the DoD TCA tier 
definitions listed in DoDM 3020.45, V1.  These definitions are to be utilized to assign tier 
ratings to identified TCAs.  The Tier definitions are: 
3.2.5.1.  Tier 1 TCA – A system or asset of which the loss, incapacitation, or disruption 
could result in mission (or function) failure at the DoD, Military Department, CCMD, 
Sub-Unified Command, Defense Agency, or Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead Agency 
(DISLA) level. 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
23 
3.2.5.1.1.  Defense Critical Asset (DCA) - TCAs of such extraordinary importance to 
operations in peace, crisis, and war, that its incapacitation or destruction would have a 
very serious, debilitating effect on the ability of the DOD to fulfill its missions.  
DCAs are not an independent tier of assets, but are a high-priority subset of Tier 1 
TCAs. 
3.2.5.2.  Tier 2 TCA – A system or asset of which the loss, incapacitation, or disruption 
could result in severe mission (or function) degradation at the DoD, Military Department, 
CCMD, Sub-Unified Command, Defense Agency, or DISLA level. 
3.2.5.3.  Critical Assets, formerly known as SICAs, are infrastructures directly used to 
support the functioning or operation of a TCA such that the supporting infrastructure 
TCA’s loss, degradation, or denial will result in the inability of  TCAs to function or 
operate as intended in the execution of their associated METs/MEFs.  An example would 
include an electrical substation that provides power to an identified TCA for which 
backup power generation is not available. 
3.2.6.  Task Asset (TA) – An asset that is directly used to support execution of one or more 
operations, activities, or METs/MEFs. 
3.2.6.1.  TAs determined to be critical to the execution of a mission are upgraded to 
TCAs and assigned a tier level based on the impact their loss would have on the mission. 
3.2.7.  The CARM Program risk management process is cyclical in nature and the CAIP 
timeline synchronizes the efforts of this process, aims to prevent duplication of effort, and 
establishes procedures and time requirements for the flow of CARM program guidance to all 
AF commands. 
3.2.8.  AF-CAMS NG is the AF CARM system of record for data associated with AF TCAs. 
3.2.8.1.  MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) are responsible for entering all of 
their TCAs into the AF CARM system of record and validating TCAs. 
3.2.8.2.  The CARM Program sustains and modernizes a Secret Internet Protocol Router 
Network (SIPRNet) database application for general programmatic tracking of critical 
systems and assets to assist with providing remediation and programmatic status on AF 
remediation efforts.  The AF CARM system of record is not an operational reporting tool, 
nor is it built or certified for those types of functions. 
3.2.8.3.  The AF CARM system of record captures critical systems and assets for 
programming remediation efforts.  The system is designed to serve as a common entry 
point for the MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) and is one-way web shared 
with CCMDs, JS/J33, and ASD (HD&GS) databases and representatives as appropriate. 
3.3.  TCA Assessment Processes. 
3.3.1.  The CARM Program utilizes products from three separate assessments to determine 
risk to AF TCAs and develop risk management strategies.  The three assessments are 1) 
Balanced Survivability Assessments (BSA), 2) Joint Mission Assurance Assessments 
(JMAA) conducted by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and 3) Air Force 
Mission Assurance Assessments (AFMAA) conducted by the AFSFC. 
24 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
3.3.2.  BSAs are mission survivability assessments which identify vulnerabilities and assess 
the mission impact should those vulnerabilities be successfully exploited.  BSAs also 
recommend measures to remediate or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.  The assessments 
are mission, rather than geographically oriented, and focus on the systems, networks, 
architectures, infrastructures, and assets supporting the specific missions targeted by the 
assessment.  BSAs are performed at the request of responsible commanders or directors. 
3.3.2.1.  BSAs consist of three phases: 1) pre-assessment phase, 2) assessment phase, and 
3) post-assessment phase.  BSA findings reports are distributed only to the assessed 
organization, the JS, the relevant CCMD(s) and service(s), the assessment requesting 
organization, and any organization mandated by DoD or service guidance.  For additional 
details regarding the activities, timelines, and products generated by the BSA, please 
reference DoDI 3000.08, Balanced Survivability Assessments. 
3.3.3.  JMAAs identify potential risks to mission execution through risks to critical systems 
and assets based on the combination of likely threats or hazards with identified 
vulnerabilities.  These include inter-and-intra-dependencies needed to accomplish required 
DoD mission requirements.  JMAAs integrate the findings of three distinct assessments: 1) 
criticality assessment, 2) all hazards/threats assessments (AHTA), and 3) vulnerability 
assessment.  JMAAs are based on DoD MAA benchmarks.  Together, these are used to form 
a risk assessment for leadership use in prioritizing response actions. 
3.3.3.1.  Criticality assessments are conducted by asset and mission owners and 
categorize the importance of assets to the DoD missions they support.  Criticality, along 
with vulnerabilities and threats/hazards, are used to determine the risk to a mission posed 
by specific assets.  Criticality assessments are driven by the information gleaned via the 
latest CAIP and include various BEI data, including at a minimum, asset name and 
description, consequence of loss statement, and applicable stakeholders.  Additionally, 
beneficial data points include missions/functions/plans supported by the asset, Impact of 
Loss (i.e., Tier I (mission failure) or Tier II (severe mission degradation), Time to 
Mission Impact, Time to Restore Mission Capability, and Criticality Rating. 
3.3.3.2.  The AHTA is a comprehensive list of known threats and hazards likely to occur 
on or in the vicinity of the installation.  It covers man-made threats (terrorism, insider 
threat, cyber threats, etc.), natural hazards (geological, meteorological, and biological), 
and accidents.  The installation AHTA should be tailored to the local environment and 
specific to the installation, identifying threats and hazards that may cause impact to 
assets, missions, or personnel.  Each identified threat or hazard will receive a rating based 
on agreed-upon definitions, which indicates the likelihood of its occurrence. 
3.3.3.2.1.  The AHTAs fulfills the DoD requirement for annual installation threat 
assessments.  It is initially drafted and then updated by on-site POCs, typically from 
the products created within the Threat WG and the EM WG.  For the purposes of the 
HHQ assessments, the assessment team may review the existing installation AHTA, 
or develop a new document if no pre-existing product is available or deemed 
satisfactory.  The AHTA provides the assessment team an understanding of the 
threats/hazards which must be considered during the assessment and will factor into 
mission risk determinations.  Additionally, it is also reviewed during the vulnerability 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
25 
assessment by the ATO and EM SMEs with the applicable on-site POCs to ensure a 
comprehensive product. 
3.3.3.3.  HHQ AFMAAs are conducted at the installation by the MAA team.  These on-
the-ground assessments determine the susceptibility of a system or asset to the identified 
threats and hazards.  The three key phases to the AFMAA are 1) assessment preparation, 
2) on-site assessment, and 3) post-assessment coordination. 
3.3.3.3.1.  The assessment preparation phase readies both the assessment team and the 
assessment recipient for the AFMAA vulnerability assessment.  This includes the 
development of a Notification Message, Assessment Focus Statement (AFS), 
execution of a pre-assessment site survey (PSS), provision of applicable POC 
information, and required documentation from the location to the assessment team, 
and other logistical coordination (i.e., security requirements, on-site requirements 
such as work space, transportation, etc.).  The assessment team will familiarize itself 
with the installation and the assets/infrastructures which are to be assessed, while the 
installation will develop an understanding of what can be expected throughout the 
process and what support and documentation must be provided to the assessment 
team.  These activities will be primarily coordinated directly between the assessment 
team and installation POCs, but the assistance of Center/Wing CARM POCs may be 
requested throughout the process. 
3.3.3.3.2.  The Notification Message for the pending assessment is delivered by the 
assessing organization through the applicable chain of command to the recipient 
installation and signifies the beginning of the pre-assessment preparation phase.  The 
notification includes a breakdown of responsibilities between stakeholders, an 
anticipated timeline, required documentation, and deliverables due upon completion 
of the assessment. 
3.3.3.3.3.  The AFS is a document usually drafted by the mission owner or asset 
owner with inputs from various stakeholders to include relevant CCMD(s) and 
service(s).  In certain circumstances, the AF may be tasked to develop the AFS for 
installations where it is not a mission owner.  The AFS outlines the programs, 
missions, assets, and special interest items to be assessed at the location, along with 
an assessment POC.  This document will guide the assessment team’s focus. 
3.3.3.3.4.  The PSS is a site visit by the assessment team to obtain additional insight 
to installation layout and local assessment partners, address pending issues or 
concerns, and prepare the assessment recipient for the AFMAA vulnerability 
assessment.  Although PSS participation may vary depending on the features of the 
location being assessed, standard PSS activities include presentations by the local 
leadership and Team Chief; a windshield tour of the installation being assessed; and 
mission briefs and asset tours for each asset being assessed.  Additionally, this visit is 
used to close out any key preparation activities that have not already been completed. 
3.3.3.3.5.  The on-site assessment is the physical execution of the AFMAA 
vulnerability assessment, which focuses on identifying vulnerabilities of the system 
or asset as well as the infrastructure components supporting the function of that 
system or asset.  Components of the on-site assessment typically include an in-brief 
presentation with key installation and tenant leadership, asset tours to include a 
26 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
mission brief on the asset, SME interviews with asset POCs, SME interviews with 
installation POCs to review support to and protection of the assets/tenants, daily hot 
washes to review findings and outstanding items, and an out-brief with installation 
and tenant leadership providing a preliminary overview of the assessment findings. 
3.3.3.4.  The post-assessment coordination is primarily conducted internally by the 
assessment team following the completion of the on-site assessment; although there may 
also be follow-up with on-site POCs to close out any remaining assessment action items.  
The internal coordination involves the drafting of an Assessment Team Report (ATR) 
highlighting the vulnerabilities identified during the assessment and providing a potential 
recommendation or COA to address each. 
3.3.3.4.1.  If an identified asset vulnerability is susceptible to specific threats or 
hazards identified in the AHTA, the report will note this pairing and also provide a 
rating for the vulnerability based on agreed upon definitions. 
3.3.3.4.2.  The threat/hazard and vulnerability pairing, along with the criticality rating 
of an asset, are used to calculate risk.  A geometric mean is used for this calculation 
and the associated rating is another data point commanders can use for resource 
allocation decisions.  The ATR is provided to the installation, MAJCOM/DRU, FOA, 
and HAF so coordination can occur across all levels for these resource allocation 
decisions. 
3.3.3.5.  The JS coordinates the selection of assessment recipients through an annual 
DoD-wide data call, which concludes and produces a schedule of forthcoming 
assessments in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of the preceding year. 
3.3.3.5.1.  DoDI 3020.45 states installations with DCAs and select Tier 1 TCAs, as 
identified by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), will be assessed at a 
minimum every three (3) years, while installations with Tier 1 and Tier 2 TCAs will 
be assessed at a minimum every five (5) years.  CCMDs, Services, and Agencies may 
coordinate with the CJCS to waive periodicity requirements for up to two (2) years if 
required.  Waivers can be granted a maximum of two (2) years for any specific 
JMAA. (T-0) 
3.3.3.5.2.  Significant changes to any of the major factors utilized to determine risk to 
an asset may necessitate reassessment of the asset inside its scheduled three (3) or 
five (5) year cycle. 
3.3.3.6.  The HAF CARM Program will collaborate with HAF/A4 MA office to provide 
AF submissions to the JS assessment data call.  Submissions should include justification 
(number and tier of TCAs, missions supported, change in missions supported, time since 
last assessment, etc.) and availability to be assessed.  Submissions will also take into 
consideration the maximum amount of resources the AF can commit to pre and post-
assessment activities.  All assessments will be coordinated through the A4 and SAF/IG 
Gatekeeper Program in order to eliminate duplication of effort and minimize disruption 
within the assessed unit’s organizations. 
 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
27 
3.3.4.  The AFMAA is the only assessment program pertaining to the CARM Program, 
which focuses exclusively on AF assets and infrastructure.  The AFMAA team structure and 
assessment format parallel that of the JMAA.  As such, the assessment stages, procedures, 
outputs, and team composition described in Section 3.3.3 also apply to the AFMAA. 
3.3.4.1.  While the JMAAs are conducted by DTRA, AFMAAs are coordinated and 
executed by the AFSFC.  The annual schedule of AFMAAs are developed by AFSFC in 
coordination with AF/A3OA with primary consideration of the assessment requirements 
dictated by AF Mission Assurance and Antiterrorism programs.  These timelines are 
established by The Deputy Secretary of Defense Mission Assurance Assessment Program 
Interim Implementation Memo and the AT Program Instruction DODI O-2000.16, V1. 
3.3.4.2.  The CARM Program will supply a Mission Analyst to participate in AFMAAs 
involving TCAs.  Mission Analysts attend the PSS, assist in asset identification, AFS 
development, and criticality and risk analysis. 
3.4.  Mission Risk Analysis. 
3.4.1.  Per paragraphs 2.17.27 and 2.20.17, RRPs will be developed to document the 
criticality data, threats, hazards, and vulnerabilities to TCAs identified during an assessment; 
as well as provide possible risk reduction COAs developed by assessment team SMEs, 
installation POCs, MAJCOM/DRUs, or FOAs.  The purpose of the COAs are to reduce risk 
to capability and increase mission resilience.  The MAJCOM/DRU Commander, or designee, 
will select a COA or determine the level of asset risk to be acceptable prior to RRP 
finalization. 
3.4.1.1.  RRPs will be developed if multiple criteria are met.  These criteria may include 
risk assessment findings of moderate or higher, a recommendation requiring a material 
solution not Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) related, and sufficient existing 
policy for the owning organization to take action. 
3.4.1.2.  RRPs will be classified in accordance with DoDM 3020.45 V3, Defense Critical 
Infrastructure Program Security Classification Manual, and related security 
classification guides. 
3.4.2.  RRP risk reduction COAs’ recommendations fall under two main categories: 
remediation and mitigation actions. 
3.4.2.1.  Remediation actions are long-term improvement efforts intended to reduce risk 
by redressing design or operational environment flaws capable of having adverse effects 
on the availability of a TCA, not actions to improve functionality or structure. 
3.4.2.2.  Mitigation actions are taken in response to a warning or after an incident has 
occurred and are intended to minimize or lessen the incident’s potentially adverse effects 
on a given mission. 
3.4.2.3.  Each COA recommendation will include a summary of the suggested action, 
expected risk reduction effectiveness, and estimates of time/investment needed to 
implement the action. 
 
28 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
3.4.3.  RRPs are drafted by the asset-owning MAJCOM/DRU or FOA utilizing the 
appropriate assessment reports and will be coordinated with the HAF CARM Program office 
or FOA SPO/PMO within 180 days of the formal assessment report release.  Personnel 
should reference Attachment 3 for a RRP template. 
3.4.4.  The HAF CARM Program will provide input to the RRP and coordinate the document 
across the HAF A-Staff and other stakeholders as needed. 
3.4.5.  The AF/A3 is responsible for final approval of RRPs.  The HAF CARM Program 
office will forward the approved RRP to the JS for finalization. 
3.4.6.  The HAF CARM Program office will distribute the approved RRP and risk response 
decision(s) across the HAF A-Staff, relevant MAJCOM/DRU or FOA, and respective 
CCMDs. 
3.4.7.  MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs must document risk response decisions in the AF CARM 
system of record so the respective chain of command can review risk decisions made at 
lower echelon levels and formulate additional guidance or direction for management of risk 
to TCAs.  Risk response documentation will include a summary of risk reduction alternatives 
considered, their expected risk reduction effectiveness, and estimates of required 
time/investment. 
3.5.  Risk Management. 
3.5.1.  The HAF CARM Program will collaborate with HAF/A4 MA to advocate on behalf of 
the MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) for remediation or mitigation actions in 
chartered executive forums and processes.  Forums include the AFCS, AFSEEB, AF Security 
Enterprise Mission Assurance (SE/MA) Working Group, MA Senior Steering Group, 
Executive Steering Group, and General Officer Steering Group as MA guidance emerges. 
3.5.2.  MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) will coordinate with appropriate 
functional offices to implement approved risk response actions. 
3.5.3.  MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) will identify funding requirements to 
implement risk response actions through the PPBE process and inform the HAF CARM 
Program of any unfunded risk reduction requirements identified in finalized RRPs. 
3.5.4.  For large scale remediation or mitigation efforts, the HAF CARM Program will 
advocate through the AF corporate process for funding and assist MAJCOM/DRUs and 
FOAs (as appropriate) in coordinating the inclusion of the identified measures in future asset 
investment planning. 
3.5.5.  The HAF CARM Program will perform periodic reviews of approved RRPs to 
determine whether identified risk reduction COAs are undergoing implementation or require 
follow up action.  Inactivity on approved remediation or mitigation efforts may be reported to 
the JS in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 
3209.01, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program. 
3.5.6.  MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) will maintain current and accurate 
records of identified TCAs and risk remediation efforts in the AF CARM system of record. 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
29 
3.5.7.  The HAF CARM Program will task MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs (as appropriate) on 
an annual basis to conduct a review of BEIs for identified TCAs to maintain data fidelity and 
asset awareness. 
3.6.  CARM WG. 
3.6.1.  The CARM WG serves at the primary working level advisory forum for the 
development, vetting, and coordination of CARM-related policies, procedures, and actions.  
This may include: 
3.6.1.1.  Identification, prioritization, and assessment of TCAs. 
3.6.1.2.  Coordinating, resourcing, and tracking of risk management decisions and 
actions. 
3.6.1.3.  Providing situational awareness of TCA availability and reliability. 
3.6.1.4.  Facilitating cross-functional and cross-organizational dialogue. 
3.6.1.5.  Supporting consequence management and COOP decisions. 
3.6.2.  CARM WG membership should reflect AF functional organizations with equity in 
TCAs or responsibilities which overlap with CARM (such as the MA community).  
Membership may also include private sector partners when applicable and security protocols 
allow.  CARM POCs will shape membership based on the requirements of their program and 
supported TCAs. 
3.6.3.  CARM WGs should be established at the HAF, MAJCOM/DRU, FOA, and asset-
owning Center/Wing levels. 
3.6.4.  The CARM WG can be incorporated into an equivalent, existing MAJCOM/DRU, 
FOA, Center/Wing, or Installation WG (e.g. Threat, COOP, or EM WG). 
3.7.  Classification Guidance. 
3.7.1.  CARM programs shall classify information regarding CARM activities, systems, or 
assets in accordance with DoDM 3020.45 V3, or as required by the system/asset or capability 
owner security classification guides. 
3.8.  Baseline Elements of Information (BEI). 
3.8.1.  BEIs represent the minimum data required to be captured on assets identified as 
critical.  They do not relieve organizations of other assigned CARM or TCA data exchange 
responsibilities, such as support of functional are characterization or vulnerability assessment 
results.  This data is required to document a system or asset in the AF CARM system of 
record and other CCMD established databases. 
3.8.2.  CARM programs may reference Enclosure 5 of DoDM 3020.45 V1 for a list of BEIs.

CARM PROGRAM TRAINING AND OUTREACH 
4.1.  The CARM training and outreach program will  provide recipients with an 
understanding of program methodologies and processes, address any programmatic updates or 
changes that may impact the field, increase cross-program and cross-function coordination, and 
enable personnel to execute the four stages of the CARM cycle.  Training will be provided 
through outreach and the leveraging of existing technologies for remote delivery. 
4.2.  Several methods of remote delivery will  be utilized to instruct personnel on the basic 
tenets of the CARM program and in the navigation of the AF CARM system of record.  
Electronic Learning Training modules provide individual, self-paced training and are available to 
all Common Access Card holders through the Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS). 
4.3.  The HAF CARM Program office will  conduct CARM Reviews with the 
MAJCOM/DRU, FOA, and Component to the Combatant Command CARM programs as 
requested.  CARM Reviews will consist of in-person discussions between the HAF and 
MAJCOM/DRU, FOA, or Component to the Combatant Command CARM staffs regarding 
CARM Program status, lessons learned/best practices, challenges faced by the field, and issues 
with which the HAF might assist.  Participation in these sessions is not limited to CARM POCs 
but may include representatives from partner programs and stakeholders (e.g. the MA or CE 
community, and the relevant CCMD).  CARM Reviews will feature a series of focused 
discussions on the following topics: 
4.3.1.  Review of the AFI-mandated MAJCOM responsibilities and tasks. 
4.3.2.  Overview of programmatic and policy updates or changes. 
4.3.3.  Review of CAIP data and ongoing TCA remediation/mitigation efforts. 
4.3.4.  Briefing CARM TCA data management capabilities and status. 
4.3.5.  Beyond the mandatory elements, CARM Reviews may be customized to the desire or 
need of the CARM field office in order to address specific areas of concern for attendees.  
Inclusion of partner programs and stakeholders to discuss specific issues with which the HAF 
CARM Program office could assist is encouraged (HAF advocacy or coordination among 
HHQ elements) and can serve to promote cross-coordination among programs.  The HAF 
will supply reach-back to provide clarity on any concepts or policies which the 
MAJCOM/DRU, FOA, or Component to the Combatant Command request. 
4.3.6.  MAJCOM/DRUs and FOAs will coordinate with the HAF CARM Program office to 
schedule Mobile Training Team (MTT) sessions for CARM personnel and cooperating 
programs at the MAJCOM/DRU and FOA levels. 
 
 
 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017

Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists to 
continue uninterrupted essential component functions across a wide range of potential 
emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-related emergencies, accidents, 
technological and/or attack-related emergencies. COOP involves plans and capabilities covering 
the same functional objectives of Continuity of Government, must be maintained at a high level 
of readiness, and be capable of implementation both with and without warning. COOP is not 
only an integral part of Continuity of Government and Enduring Constitutional Government 
(ECG), but is simply "good business practice" - part of the Department of Defense's fundamental 
mission as a responsible and reliable public institution. 
Criticality—A metric used to describe the consequence of loss of an asset, based on the effect 
the incapacitation or destruction of the asset would have on DoD operations and the ability of the 
Department of Defense to fulfill its missions.

of capabilities and assets including personnel, equipment, facilities, networks, information, and 
information systems, infrastructure, and supply chains that are critical to the execution of DoD 
mission-essential functions in any operating environment or condition. 
Mission Essential Function (MEF)—The specified or implied tasks required to be performed 
by or derived from statute, executive, or other appropriate guidance, and those organizational 
activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DoD Component missions 
or responsibilities in a continuity threat or event.  Failure to perform or sustain these functions 
would significantly affect DoD’s ability to provide vital services, or exercise authority, direction, 
and control. 
Mission Essential Task (MET)—A mission task selected by a commander deemed essential to 
mission accomplishment and defined using the common language of the Universal Joint Task 
List in terms of task, condition, and standard.  Differs from a joint mission essential task in that it 
may reflect missions tasked within a sole DoD Component’s authority. 
Mission Essential Task List (METL)—A list of METs/MEFs selected by a commander to 
accomplish an assigned or anticipated mission that includes associated tasks, conditions, and 
standards and also requires the identification of command-linked and supporting tasks.

A2.1.  During the initial step of the CAIP process  , DoD mission owners (CCMDs, Defense 
Agencies, Military Departments) will decompose their assigned missions and core functions to 
identify the specific METs/MEFs each requires to be implemented by the resource providers.  
This information allows resource providers such as Services or Field Activities to select the 
individual METs/MEFs their organizations execute in support of assigned missions.  This 
process is then replicated at each subordinate organizational level until a list of METs/MEFs 
required to execute missions are identified down to the Wing level.  CARM POCs do not usually 
perform mission decomposition, but utilize its results to identify the assets which enable the 
implementation of those missions supported by their respective organizations. 
A2.1.1.  The authoritative sources for DoD METs are the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL), 
which comprises all of DoD’s joint missions, and the Air Force Universal Task List 
(AFUTL), which compliments the UJTL missions for which the AF has specific 
responsibilities.  MEFs are organizationally derived, and used to augment applicable METs.  
Services and other resource providers may assign responsibility for missions to subordinate 
organizations.  MAJCOM/DRU, FOA (as appropriate), and Wing Commanders are 
responsible for identifying those METs supported by their organizations.  The relevant METs 
are then loaded by each organization into the DRRS or a similar mission readiness database.  
CARM POCs should leverage their organization’s Readiness Officer to navigate this system 
and to retrieve applicable entries. 
A2.1.2.  Each of a Command’s assigned METs/MEFs contains standards and conditions 
which define acceptable levels of execution.  Combined, these represent an accepted 
expression of a mission and a quantifiable means to measure mission impact. 
A2.2.  METs and MEFs obtained from DRRS will  then serve as the foundation for asset 
identification and nomination activities performed by CARM POCs and WGs.  CARM POCs 
should provide a list of installation or command-supported METs/MEFs to CARM WG 
members.  From that list, CARM WG members should identify the specific METs/MEFs their 
organizations support and then provide SMEs capable of determining the specific assets utilized 
to execute those tasks. 
A2.3.  Assets determined to operate in support of  assigned METs/MEFs will qualify as TAs.  
If further analysis by CARM POCs and the CARM WG determines that the degradation or 
removal of a TA will cause mission degradation or failure, (as determined by the MET/MEF’s 
standards and conditions), then the asset must be nominated for TCA validation.  Expanded 
analysis of each nominated TCA will be conducted at the HHQ level to determine if a redundant 
capability exists within the larger AOR.  If no viable alternative capability is detected, the asset 
is validated as a TCA at the HAF level and submitted to the JS. 
A2.4.  Validation of nominated assets as  critical to the execution of assigned METs/MEFs is a 
core function of the CAIP process.  The essential requisites for validation include: 
A2.4.1.  Confirming and documenting the METs/MEFs that are assigned and executed.  This 
reinforces the TCA identification process that starts with the mission.  TCAs cannot exist 
without an associated mission or function. 
 
 
42 
AFI10-2402  29 AUGUST 2017 
A2.4.2.  Documenting TCAs and associated data points for any mission.  All TCA 
nominations will be approved by each Center/Wing Commander prior to the initiation of the 
validation process. (T-1) Responsibility for asset data entry into the AF CARM system of 
record will be determined by the MAJCOM/DRU or FOA (as appropriate).  The nominated 
TCAs will be reviewed and validated by the respective MAJCOM/DRU and FOA (as 
appropriate).  Upon completion, the HAF CARM Program will conduct an informal review 
of the data for mission impact and completeness.  After the HAF CARM Program review, the 
AF/A3 will approve and release the AF Tiers 1 and 2 TCA data to the JS/J33 for review and 
coordination.  This process includes: 
A2.4.2.1.  Documenting and verifying the scope of impact of loss or degradation of a 
TCA. 
A2.4.2.2.  Providing BEI data to be approved by each level of command and 
subsequently reviewed and validated by the next echelon of command. 
A2.5.  The JS will  review the mission impact statement associated with each validated DCA 
and nominate those which meet DCA criteria to the ASD (HD&GS) for review.  The ASD 
(HD&GS) approved list of DCAs will be provided to the appropriate DoD Components.
