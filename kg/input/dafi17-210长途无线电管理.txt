SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Major changes 
include:  1) consolidation of several separate programs into radio management, 2) removal of 
Satellite Communications as a major section except where it is used as part of a particular system 
covered by this publication, 3) removal of Land Mobile Radios as a major section, and 4) removal 
of Personal Wireless Communications from this publication. 
1.  OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND.  This publication establishes guidance and defines 
roles for the management of long-haul radio communications DAF-wide. Our communication 
systems require strict governance and standards to maintain operational readiness and ensure 
reliability. This includes, but is not limited to, the High Frequency Global Communications 
System, Mystic Star (MS) Communications, Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS), and the 
Department of the Air Force Call Sign Program. 
1.1.  High Frequency Global Communications System is a globally networked, centrally 
operated, high power high frequency system consisting of 13 high power high frequency 
stations located around the globe and provides worldwide command and control 
communications to Department of Defense aircraft, ships, and ground users.  All DAF users 
with high-power high frequency (>1,000 watts) shall vet their requirements through the lead 
command office IAW DAFPD 10-9. (T-2).  The lead command will coordinate and be the 
focal point to collect and consolidate review of the requirement before the user seeks an 
alternative material solution or acquisition contract to fill those requirements. (T-1).  This 
guidance does not apply to the URC-119 Pacer Bounce and other portable and deployable high 
frequency systems. 
1.2.  Mystic Star (MS) Communications is a worldwide communications mission, executed by 
elements of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force under the direction of Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA).  MS consists of ultra-high frequency satellite and high 
frequency networks supporting Presidential, special air, commander-in-chief, Joint Staff, very 
important person, and command airborne missions.  The system consists of co-network control 
stations, inter-station and inter-site circuits, as well as relay and auxiliary communications 
subsystems. 
1.3.  Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) is an organized network of civilian volunteers 
whose mission is to assist Department of Defense or civilian authorities’ operations during, or 
in response to, any major disruption of Department of Defense or other communications 
networks.  MARS provides health, morale, and welfare radio communications support to 
military members, civilian employees and contractors of Department of Defense components, 
and civil agency employees and contractors, when in remote or isolated areas, in contingencies 
or whenever appropriate.  DAF MARS provides worldwide fixed and mobile emergency 
communications that support the disaster preparedness program as defined in DoDI 4650.02, 
Military Auxiliary Radio System.  For current DAF policy and guidance pertaining to MARS, 
contact 38.cyrs.scm.mars@us.af.mil.

1.4.  DAF Call Sign Program establishes call sign procedures and Call Sign Lists (CSLs) to 
identify military aircraft, organizations, activities, base units, operational facilities, staff, and 
geographic locations.  Call Sign procedures will be adhered to by all users of the CSL-1 (DAF 
Call Sign List), CSL-2 (Air Combat Command Standard CSL-1 Extract), and CSL-3 (Sensor 
Pacer). (T-1).  Units will send all call sign requests through their Major Command (MAJCOM) 
or Field Command (FLDCOM) representatives. (T-2). Supported units and/or activities outside 
of DAF will submit requests directly to the DAF Call Sign Office. (T-2). For current DAF

3.4.1.  Use English language dictionary words as the call sign, followed by a numeric 
suffix. (T-0).  Call signs must be easy to pronounce and spell. (T-0).  Avoid using words 
that are homophones, two words that sound alike but have different spellings (e.g., ‘quartz’ 
and ‘quarts’).  Supported units must request only the minimum number of numeric suffixes 
required for operations. (T-0). 
3.4.2.  Aircraft call signs must be words four to six letters in length, followed by one-, two-
, or three-digit suffix. (T-0).  For maximum operational security assurance, the one-, two-, 
or three-digit call sign suffix should not contain any part of the aircraft registration number.  
Call sign words must be either a single word or two words merged into one maximum six-
letter group. (T-0).  Total combination of letters and numbers must not exceed seven 
characters. (T-0).  Avoid truncations or shortening of words, truncation may cause errors 
in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic management systems.  One or two 
letter call signs are not authorized. (T-1).  Coordination with FAA is required to ensure 
DAF call signs do not duplicate or interfere with FAA Special Call Signs assigned to 
Federal, State or local civilian government agencies. (T-0).

must be coordinated by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Air 
Force Civil/Military Aviation Integration Division (AF/A3OJ) and the FAA in order to 
obtain International Civil Aviation Organization approval. (T-0).  These call signs are 
generally reserved only for commercial airline use and thus must be specially 
coordinated. 
3.4.2.2.  This process is required to ensure they are approved by International Civil 
Aviation Administration, included in the FAA Sensitive Flight Data security program, 
and are compatible with FAA air traffic management systems.  Use of three-letter call 
signs that are not approved through this process are not authorized. (T-0). 
3.4.3.  Authorized variations and details are listed in Annex A of the Voice Call Sign 
Operating Instruction located on Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network at 
https://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/usafcallsigns/sitepages/home.aspx. 
3.4.4.  Units are authorized one static call sign for every permanently assigned aircraft. 
3.4.5.  Use changing call signs to the maximum extent to enhance operational security 
during operations, exercises and contingency operations, while conducting research and 
development testing, and evaluating programs. 
3.4.6.  Call signs will not contain any of the following unless specifically authorized by the 
Voice Call Sign Operating Instruction:  Acronyms, MAJCOM, FLDCOM, or unit name, 
abbreviations, phonetic alphabet, or spoken numbers other than authorized suffixes. (T-2). 
3.4.7.  MAJCOM and FLDCOM authorized waivers must be submitted in writing to the
