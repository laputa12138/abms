INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. General Information. This handbook addresses procedures used to set 
up and operate the M-80 Water Heater; Advanced Design Refrigerator, 300 
Cubic Foot (ADR-300); Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit 
(FDECU); and the 130K Multi-Fuel Portable Heater (Figure 1.1). It is meant 
to be used by civil engineer heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrige-
ration (HVAC/R) personnel in performing their beddown and sustainment 
mission taskings under contingency conditions. Users of this handbook 
should have a basic knowledge of bare base assets and their functions—
readers without this fundamental knowledge should review the references in 
Attachment 1 and contact their unit’s training manager for training options. 
1.2. Overview. The information presented here is designed to augment, not 
replace, technical orders for bare base mechanical systems. It highlights gen-
eral characteristics, setup, and basic operating procedures. Personnel should 
refer to applicable technical orders for more detailed information, including 
maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair of these systems.

1.3. Safety. Complying with proper safety procedures is vital when setting up 
and operating bare base mechanical systems. The flammable fuels and lethal 
voltages used in the operation of many of these systems are significant ha-
zards, and adherence to all technical order warnings is critical to avoid per-
sonal injury or death. Furthermore, the dangers associated with maintaining 
systems that use lethal voltages make it imperative that the techniques and 
procedures outlined in AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, be applied at 
all times. Below are some general warnings that pertain to many of the bare 
base mechanical systems currently in use: 
 
 
 
WARNING 
Lethal voltage is present when mechanical systems are 
connected to a power source. Disconnect from power 
source before inspecting or repairing any electrical 
component. Be careful not to touch electrical connec-
tions. Electrical shock and/or death may result from 
failure to heed this warning. 
WARNING 
Do not wear metal frame glasses, rings, watches or 
other metal jewelry while working on electronic 
equipment. 
WARNING 
Dangerous and lethal voltage is used in the operation 
of many bare base mechanical systems. Make sure 
power supply circuit breakers are in the OFF position 
before connecting or disconnecting the power supply. 
Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death 
to personnel.

1.4. Additional Information. The siting and installation of some bare base 
mechanical systems may be impacted by the facilities they support; i.e., 
shower/shave units, personnel tents, kitchens, or laundry facilities. Person-
nel should review technical orders for these facilities when attaching or 
integrating bare base mechanical systems. In addition, contact the Air Force 
Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) Reach-Back Center if you are 
looking for information not found in this publication or the references in 
Attachment 1. Call the Reach-Back Center at 888-232-3721 (commercial), 
DSN 523-6995, or email at afcesareachbackcenter@tyndall.af.mil. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
WARNING 
Mechanical systems are heavy and require an appro-
priate lifting device to move. Personal injury can re-
sult if moved without the aid of a lifting device. 
WARNING 
Exposed fuel and fuel vapor can ignite or explode, 
resulting in possible serious injury or death. Observe 
proper safety precautions when servicing the fuel sys-
tem 
WARNING 
Fuel used with these systems is highly flammable and 
may cause severe burns or death if handled improper-
ly.

M-80 WATER HEATER 
 
2.1. General Information. The M-80 water heater (Figure 2.1) is the prima-
ry method of providing hot water at a bare base. It is used to supply hot water 
to bare base facilities, such as kitchens, shower and shave units, and laundry 
and medical facilities. It fulfills a critical sanitation need in addition to im-
proving morale at austere locations. Operators and maintainers should ob-
serve all technical order warnings and cautions to ensure safe operation of the 
water heater and all associated equipment. 
Figure 2.1. M-80 Water Heater. 
 
2.2. Characteristics and Features. The water heater is a skid-mounted, 
self-contained, liquid fuel-fired boiler. It will operate on several types of 
fuel; including diesel, jet fuel, or fuel oil (Table 2.1). The heater also uses 
208-volt, three-phase power (generator or commercial power) to operate its 
blower and fuel pump. The supporting water pump (not a component of the 
M-80) also uses this power source. The water heater delivers water at a rate 
of approximately 9 gallons per minute (gpm) at temperatures between 100o 
Fahrenheit (F) and 190o F. Water enters and exits the vessel through sepa-
rate manifolds, and the water supply can be from natural sources such as 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009 
 
12 
lakes, rivers, or bare base and commercial water distribution systems. Safe-
ty features include an automatic flame safeguard control system and an au-
dio alarm that alerts the operator when a low fuel condition or loss of flame 
occurs. Although the M-80 itself is relatively small, it is very heavy and 
requires a forklift to position the unit. In its crated configuration, the heater 
weighs approximately 1,065 pounds. Even when unpacked, the heater still 
weighs approximately 465 pounds. Prominent features of the heater consist 
of the following systems, subassemblies, and supporting equipment items.

2.2.1. Fuel System. The fuel system includes components such as the fuel 
pump, filter, shutoff valve, gauges, and supply hoses (Figure 2.2). Fuel is 
commonly provided in 55-gallon drums (5-gallon jerry cans can be used) and 
fed to the heater through the drum fill adapter and flexible hose assembly 
(Figure 2.3). Excess fuel returns through a fuel return hose connected to the 
bottom of the fuel pump and the return fitting on the drum fill adapter. 
Figure 2.2. Select Fuel System Components.

Figure 2.3. Drum Fill Adapter and Flexible Hoses on Fuel Cans. 
 
2.2.2. Power System. Electrical power to the M-80 water heater is supplied 
from an external power source through a power cable assembly that extends 
from a power distribution panel or generator. The power cable assembly is 
part of the bare base kitchen, shower, laundry, and medical facilities and typi-
cally consists of a dual-junction power cable that connects the power source 
to the water heater and supporting water pump (Figure 2.4). 
Figure 2.4. Sample Power Cable Assembly Connection.

2.2.3. Burner Head Assembly. The burner head assembly (Figure 2.5) at the 
center of the combustion chamber serves as a mounting platform for the fuel 
nozzle, two sparkplug electrodes, the burner assembly sight glass, and the 
ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) scanner that is part of the flame safeguard 
control system. When the power switch is activated, the sparkplug electrodes 
(Figure 2.6) are energized to ignite the fuel mixture from the fuel nozzle to 
heat the water.

AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009 
15 
2.2.4. Ignition Transfer Assembly and Ignition Cables. The ignition trans-
fer assembly is where the transformer is located, and the ignition cables lead 
from the transformer to the sparkplug electrodes (Figure 2.7). The transfor-
mer provides the voltage needed to fire the electrodes. 
2.2.5. Control Box Assembly. The control box (Figure 2.7) contains most of 
the electrical contacts, relays, switches, and controls for the heater, including 
the power switch and twist-lock receptacle, motor contactor reset, flame fail-
ure alarm, and hour meter. 
2.2.6. Water Vessel. The water vessel (Figure 2.7) contains the water being 
heated. It holds approximately 24 gallons. 
Figure 2.7. Ignition Cables, Transformer, Control Box, and Vessel. 
 
2.2.7. Blower Assembly. The blower assembly (Figure 2.8) provides and 
controls airflow to the burner. The amount of air is controlled by an adjusta-
ble shutter assembly on the blower. The shutter assembly consists of an air 
band and air band adjustment rivet.

2.2.8. Sight Glass Assembly. Two sight glasses (Figure 2.9) are on the M-80 
heater. One is for visually inspecting flame in the combustion chamber and the 
other is to check firing of the sparkplug electrodes.

2.2.9. Operating Control and Water Temperature Gauge (Figure 2.10). 
The operating control is used to set the desired water temperature. Although 
the control has a calibrated scale ranging from 0o F to 250o F, it actually regu-
lates the burner to maintain the water temperature between 100o F and 190o F. 
The water temperature gauge indicates the temperature of the water inside the 
water heater. 
Figure 2.10. Operating Control and Water Temperature Gauge. 
 
2.2.10. Upper Manifold Assembly. The upper manifold (Figure 2.11) in-
cludes the hot water output valve, valve vent, pressure relief valve, and high 
limit control. The hot water output valve controls the flow of hot water from 
the upper manifold and through the hot water supply hose. The vent valve is 
used to bleed air from the water heater. The pressure relief valve activates 
and relieves the pressure when the internal temperature exceeds the pre-
scribed limit. Lastly, the high limit control deactivates the fuel solenoid valve 
when the water temperature exceeds 190o F. 
2.2.11. Lower Manifold Assembly. The lower manifold (Figure 2.12) 
serves as the water intake point of the heater to which the water hose is con-
nected.

2.2.12. Water Pump. The portable water pump is supporting equipment and 
is not a component of the M-80 water heater. It is usually packaged with bare 
base shower, kitchen, laundry, and medical facilities. The pump is electrically 
driven and draws water from sources such as lakes and rivers, water bladders, 
and other base water distribution sources. A water hose with a 1-inch inside 
diameter attaches to the intake side of the pump and serves as the suction line 
from the water source. With surface water sources like lakes, streams, or riv-
ers, the suction hose is equipped with a strainer assembly on the end to pre-
vent entry of debris. The pump connects to the water heater using a 6-foot 
long, 1-1/2 inch inside diameter hose (Figure 2.13). 
Figure 2.13. Portable Water Pump with Hoses. 
 
2.3. Set-Up Procedures. The siting and installation of the water heater unit 
should be according to specifications of the supported facility; i.e., 
shower/shave unit, kitchen, or laundry. In many cases, siting and installa-
tion will be further impacted by the type of water source used and the 
equipment available. For example, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources 
(BEAR) sets have different pumps and hoses that may require special siting 
and installation procedures. Regardless of the water source or equipment 
used, attempt to locate the water heater away from avenues of pedestrian 
traffic and far enough away from its supported facility to permit ready 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009 
 
20 
access for operation, maintenance, and refueling. Also, ensure drainage 
flows away from the heater once a final location is selected. The following 
paragraphs address other fundamental procedures for setting up the water 
heater and associated equipment. 
 
2.3.1. Connect Water Pump to Water Source. Use the following proce-
dures when connecting the pump to surface, open, and closed water sources. 
If surface water (lake, river, or stream) is used as the water source, general 
guidelines suggest the water pump should be located within 20 feet of the 
source and not more than 15 feet above it. However, a more likely scenario 
may have the water pump connected directly to a water bladder or tank 
placed near the heater unit. 
2.3.1.1. Install the main water supply hose (25-foot suction hose) on the 
pump inlet connector. 
2.3.1.2. If using surface or open water sources, install the strainer or intake 
screen on the opposite end of the suction hose. Then place the strainer end of 
the suction hose into the water source, ensuring the hose and strainer are posi-
tioned so that sediment, sand, and other unwanted particles do not enter the 
suction hose. Make sure the strainer is completely submerged when in opera-
tion. Figure 2.14 and Figure 2.15 provide two improvised methods of plac-
ing the suction hose in open water sources. Almost any floatable object can 
be used in lieu of the 55-gallon drum and logs depicted in the two examples. 
See AFPAM 10-219, Volume 7, Expedient Methods, for more examples. 
2.3.1.3. If using a closed water supply (bladder, tanks, facility water source, 
etc.), connect the pump suction hose without the strainer directly to the water 
source. 
WARNING 
Be sure that fuel lines do not touch or cross water hos-
es, power cable, or exhaust duct. Melting/damage can 
occur, causing leaking fuel and water or electrical 
hazards. Death by electrocution, fire, or explosion 
could result.

ADVANCED DESIGN REFRIGERATOR, 300 CUBIC FOOT 
(ADR-300) 
 
3.1. General Information. The ADR-300 (Figure 3.1) provides refrigerated 
storage for a wide range of items, including food, medical supplies, and ca-
davers. The system also provides thermal protection for stored items during 
transport, including air shipment. It provides 281 cubic feet of storage space 
and can maintain inside temperatures as low as 0o F at 110o F ambient tem-
perature. The system does not require personnel in any specific Air Force Specialty 
(AFS) for normal operation; however, AFS 3E1X1, Heating, Ventilation, Air Con-
ditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC/R) technicians may be required for setup and 
some maintenance activities. 
Figure 3.1. ADR-300. 
 
3.2. Characteristics and Features. The ADR-300 is an insulated container 
constructed from aluminum-skinned composite panels and mounted on a 
formed aluminum skid. The refrigerator is available in green and desert sand 
colors. The skid includes forklift pockets and replaceable cargo rails on all 
sides. Some of the regular features are illustrated in Figure 3.2. The lever-
activated container door lock is located on the left side of the door. The door

is further secured with two rotating door handle unit assemblies. Sling rings 
are attached to the four top corners of the container and used to lift the system 
either by crane or helicopter sling. Additional features are addressed in the 
following paragraphs. 
Figure 3.2. ADR-300 Features (Front View). 
 
3.2.1. Floor Drain and Exterior Drain Plug. A floor drain (Figure 3.3) re-
moves liquids trapped inside the container by discharging the fluids through a 
one-inch diameter tube to a port at the front of the skid. A plug at the exit end 
of the tube seals the drain (Figure 3.4). This plug also serves as a pressure re-
lease in the event of a sudden decrease of outside pressure.

3.3. Set-Up Procedures. 
 
3.3.1. Siting the ADR-300. Site the container in an area that is relatively level 
and free of rocks and other obstructions. The cleared area should be large 
enough for the container itself and permit unrestricted movement of cargo han-
dling equipment. The site should have adequate surface drainage and an appro-
priate electrical power supply. Unload and move the container using a forklift 
or overhead crane. When using a forklift, use any of the built-in forklift pockets 
on the container base (Figure 3.11), and use a spotter to ensure forklift blades 
enter the forklift pockets. If using an overhead crane and sling lines to hoist the 
container, ensure that the sling lines create an angle of MORE THAN 45° with 
the container roof to prevent structural damage to the ADR. Ignoring these pro-
cedures may result in damage to the equipment. 
Figure 3.11. Built-In Forklift Pockets. 
 
WARNING 
The ADR-300 weighs as much as 10,000 lbs (4,536 
kilograms (kg)) when fully loaded. Lift and move the 
container only with material handling equipment of at 
least 10,000-lb capacity. Observe all safety precau-
tions and never stand under an ADR-300 when it is 
being lifted.

trouble with the refrigerator unit. Often you can feel, smell, hear, or see many 
problems before they get worse. Perform the ―Before Operation‖ PMCS to 
ensure the refrigerator and its associated equipment are in good working con-
dition.  
3.4.1. Perform “Before Operation” PMCS. PMCS verifies that all compo-
nents are correctly installed and secure and there is no visible damage to the 
frame or components that could cause unsafe operation. Perform ―Before 
Operation‖ PMCS according to procedures in Table 3.2.

Check: 
Unserviceable If: 
Refrigerator Operation: (After 
starting the refrigerator unit ac-
cording to paragraph 3.4.2.) Note 
the interior temperature. 
Set the setpoint to 32º F (if the 
interior temperature is lower than 
32º F, set the setpoint at least 5o 
below the interior temperature). 
Confirm that the unit operation 
indicator light glows green (cool-
ing mode). 
After the interior temperature has 
dropped below 36o F, start a ma-
nual defrost cycle. Confirm that 
the defrost indicator light is on. 
Set the thermostat setpoint to ap-
proximately 50o F. Confirm that 
the unit operation indicator light 
glows red (heating mode). 
The refrigerator does not enter the 
heating mode when the setpoint is 
above the interior temperature or 
cooling mode when setpoint is be-
low the interior temperature.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The defrost mode does not start 
when the manual defrost is in-
itiated. 
3.4.2. Start the Refrigeration Unit. After connecting the power supply and 
performing PMCS, start the refrigeration unit as follows: 
3.4.2.1. Press the ON/OFF key on the unit controller. The ON/OFF light will 
remain illuminated and the unit will start, stop, and defrost automatically 
while maintaining the desired setpoint temperature. 
3.4.2.2. Enter the setpoint by pressing and holding the setpoint key. The set-
point temperature will be displayed in the display window for 10-15 seconds.

3.4.4. Perform Operational Checks. Once the refrigeration unit is operating, 
make periodic checks according to Table 3.3 and lubricate refrigeration con-
tainer parts according to Table 3.4.  
Table 3.3. ADR-300 Operational PMCS. 
Check: 
Unserviceable If: 
Refrigeration Operation: Check 
that the interior temperature is hold-
ing at the setpoint. Check that the 
air pathways are not blocked. 
Check accumulation of frost on 
inside unit. 
Temperature is not maintained, 
pathways are blocked, or there is 
significant frost accumulation. 
Refrigeration Container: Check 
the entire container for damage. 
Check the door fit and seal. Check 
door hinges and handles for lubrica-
tion. Check for loose or missing 
hardware. 
There are damaged container pa-
nels or loose, missing, or dam-
aged components or there is bind-
ing or restricted movement of 
moving parts.

3.4.5. Unusual Operating Conditions. Several environmental conditions can 
present special challenges to ADR-300 operation. They may include high 
humidity, low and high ambient temperatures, blowing sand or dust, snow, or 
other conditions.  
3.4.5.1. High Humidity Conditions. High humidity may increase the rate at 
which frost accumulates on the evaporator coil. Avoid opening and closing 
the cargo door more than necessary. This will reduce the amount of humid air 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009 
 
56 
entering the container and the resulting accumulation of frost. Although the 
refrigeration unit is designed to defrost automatically, users should monitor 
the level of frost accumulation on the evaporator (interior) coil. If a signifi-
cant level of frost is observed, begin a manual defrost cycle or adjust the de-
frost timer according to T.O. 40R7-6-1. 
3.4.5.2. Low and High Ambient Temperatures.  
3.4.5.2.1. Low ambient temperatures enhance the performance of the refrige-
ration unit; however, those conditions also cause plastic and rubber elements 
to stiffen and become brittle. Handle plastic and rubber parts gently in cold 
weather to avoid cracking or breaking. The door gasket may freeze to the 
doorframe; therefore, pull firmly and steadily to separate the gasket from the 
frame when opening the container door. 
3.4.5.2.2. High ambient temperatures result in high refrigeration loads while 
degrading the performance of the refrigeration unit. Therefore, the user should 
try to minimize the loads on the system in this environment. Locate the ADR 
such that it is shaded from the midday sun. Avoid opening the container door 
and do not hold the door open longer than necessary. Avoid, to the greatest 
extent possible, placing large, warm cargoes in the container all at once. 
3.4.5.3. Blowing Sand and Dust. Sand and dust tend to damage moving 
parts and accumulate on the refrigeration coils, particularly the condenser 
(outside) coil. Clean the coil surfaces regularly with water and remove accu-
mulations of sand and dust by blowing compressed air over them. Also, avoid 
opening and closing the container door more than necessary. During short 
periods of high levels of airborne sand or dust, the ADR may be shutdown 
and the refrigeration unit covered to reduce the amount of sand and dust 
drawn into the unit. If this is done, shutdown the ADR before covering the 
refrigeration unit and carefully monitor the container interior temperature to 
be sure it remains at safe levels for the stored cargo. 
3.4.5.4. Snow. Accumulations of snow or ice around the condenser air inlet 
or outlet may reduce the airflow through the coil and degrade the perfor-
mance of the refrigeration unit. Keep these openings as clear as possible to 
promote good airflow. Note. Do not permit more than 12 inches of snow to 
accumulate on the container roof. Accumulations of snow elsewhere on or 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009 
57 
around the unit should not affect the ADR-300 performance. Users are ad-
vised to keep controls, displays, and gauges clear of snow accumulation to 
make routine ADR-300 operation and monitoring easier. 
3.4.6. Emergency Procedures. There are two occasions when the ADR-300 
may pose a danger to personnel and require emergency procedures; personnel 
locked inside the container and rapid loss of refrigerant.  
3.4.6.1. Personnel Locked Inside the Container. Individuals locked inside 
the container with the refrigeration unit running or not, face a potential emer-
gency. Personnel trapped inside the container may suffocate due to lack of fresh 
air or may suffer hypothermia (low body temperature) if exposed to low inte-
rior temperatures. To prevent these dangers, the container door can be opened 
from the inside at any time, even if the handle is padlocked. To open the door 
from the inside, simply rotate the interior door handle unit assemblies to the 
vertical position and push the plunger. This will release the door latch and al-
low the door to swing open. 
3.4.6.2. Rapid Loss of Refrigerant. A rapid and total loss of refrigerant may 
result from a broken refrigerant line and may displace air, causing possible 
suffocation. In the event of a sudden loss of refrigerant, personnel should exit 
the container immediately and leave the door open to allow the refrigerant to 
dissipate.  
3.4.6.3. Other emergencies may occur that do not present a hazard to person-
nel. These situations involve the potential loss or spoilage of cargo due to an 
inability of the system to maintain the required interior temperature. If the 
system is unable to maintain the preset interior temperature, refer to operator 
troubleshooting procedures in T.O. 40R7-6-1.  
3.5. Shutdown Procedures. To shutdown, turn OFF the refrigeration unit at 
the control panel located inside the control box and unplug the power supply 
cable from the refrigeration unit.  
3.6. Preparation for Storage or Shipment. When ADR-300 operations are 
completed, empty and clean the container, and prepare it for storage or ship-
ment. If cargo will be stored inside the container during shipment, comply 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009 
 
58 
with paragraph 3.6.3.1 and ensure that the cargo is stored according to load-
ing procedures in T.O. 40R7-6-1 and other applicable guidance. 
3.6.1. Cleaning. Wash both the interior and exterior of the container and al-
low the interior to dry thoroughly before closing it for storage. The exterior of 
the container and refrigeration unit may be washed with a low-pressure water 
spray. Ensure the ADR is disconnected from its primary power supply before 
washing the exterior, and be careful to avoid spraying water up into the con-
denser section of the refrigeration unit. The interior of the container should be 
cleaned only when the refrigerator is turned off and the interior is approx-
imately room temperature (68 to 77o F). Use a low-pressure water spray and 
mild detergent to clean the container surfaces and shelves, and be careful to 
avoid spraying water up into the evaporator coil. Do not soak electrical com-
ponents, and drain all water from the container through the floor drain. 
3.6.2. Storing. If the ADR-300 will be unused for an extended period, take 
steps to preserve and protect the system. Basic steps include cleaning the unit 
and elevating it off the ground or floor to allow air circulation under the con-
tainer. Place the container on at least three evenly-spaced 4- x 4-inch beams 
laid across the width of the container. This helps to prevent moisture accumu-
lation and corrosion. If possible, store the container on a slight slope to en-
hance drainage. When storing ADR-300s, the containers may be stacked no 
more than two high. Lifting with a crane requires a hoist of 10,000-lb (4,536 
kg) capacity and slings connected to the lifting rings in the upper corners of 
the container. Ensure that the sling lines create an angle of more than 45 de-
grees with the container roof to prevent structural damage to the ADR. Fail-
ure to comply may result in damage to the equipment.  
 
WARNING 
When stacking one ADR-300 on top of another, en-
sure both units are aligned so that front and side walls 
of top unit are flush with front and side walls of lower 
unit. This will ensure that the lower unit will support 
the weight of the top unit. Failure to comply may re-
sult in serious injury or death to personnel. 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009 
59 
3.6.3. Shipping. The ADR-300 may be shipped in either an operational (re-
frigerated) or non-operational condition. The container is designed to retain 
cold temperatures inside for several hours without a source of power. The 
ADR may be transported by truck, rail, internal airlift, and external airlift 
(helicopter sling) according to procedures in T.O. 40R7-6-1. Regardless of 
which transportation method is used, be sure not to exceed the lifting, hoist-
ing, or transporting weight limits of equipment and vehicles. 
3.6.3.1. Shipping in Operational Condition. If the container will be shipped 
with refrigerated cargo, ensure the designated gross weight limit is not ex-
ceeded and complete the following steps. 
 
3.6.3.1.1. Restrain all cargo items as described in T.O. 40R7-6-1 and turn off 
the interior light. 
3.6.3.1.2. If the cargo will not be damaged by freezing and time permits, re-
duce the setpoint temperature to a low level and allow the cargo to cool to 
that temperature. 
 
 
WARNING 
For ADR-300 systems that will be airlifted, door handle 
unit assemblies should be left unlocked, using only the 
main door handle to hold the door closed. This will 
allow pressure relief, if necessary, during flight. Failure 
to comply may cause serious injury or death to person-
nel. Failure to comply may also cause equipment to 
implode or explode, causing hazard to the aircraft. 
CAUTION 
Do not exceed the designated weight limit. The con-
tainer’s gross weight should never exceed 10,000 lbs 
(4,536 kg). Failure to comply may cause damage to 
the container or cargo handling equipment. 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009

3.6.3.1.3. Lock the cargo door and confirm the seal is satisfactory. 
3.6.3.1.4. Confirm that the drain plug located under the door on the front face 
of the ADR-300 is installed. 
3.6.3.1.5. As near as possible to the departure time, shutdown the refrigera-
tion unit, disconnect the power cord from the source of power, and move the 
container where necessary. 
3.6.3.2. Shipping in Non-Operational Condition. If the ADR-300 is to be 
moved in a non-operational condition, complete the following steps: 
3.6.3.2.1. Turn off the interior light, shutdown the refrigeration unit, and dis-
connect the power supply cord. 
3.6.3.2.2. Clean the container interior according to paragraph 3.6.1. 
3.6.3.2.3. Restrain all loose items inside the container to the restraint rings on 
the floor of the container, close and lock the cargo door, and move the con-
tainer where necessary.

FIELD DEPLOYABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL  UNIT 
(FDECU) 
 
4.1. General Information. The FDECU is the primary air conditioning and 
heating unit supporting BEAR sets (Figure 4.1). The unit provides cooled and 
dehumidified air, or heated air, through flexible ducts into various types of 
portable shelters and containers. The FDECU is available in several different 
models; however, the images and information presented in this chapter is ge-
neric in nature and not for any particular model, unless specified. 
Figure 4.1. Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU). 
 
4.2. Characteristics and Features. The FDECU is a horizontally configured, 
electric-motor-driven heat pump. The unit will circulate and filter air and 
provide fresh make-up air as desired. It can be used while directly exposed to 
the environment and will operate with filter blower overpressure systems 
developed for use in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
(CBRN) environments. Total airflow is 2200 standard cubic feet per minute 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009

(SCFM), and make-up airflow is adjustable between 0 and 500 SCFM. The 
unit uses 14 pounds of R-134A refrigerant as a normal charge and delivers 
cooling capacity at 55,000 BTUH to 67,000 BTUH and heating capacity at 
47,000 BTUH to 84,000 BTUH. The FDECU weighs a maximum of 700 to 
800 pounds (depending on model type), and a forklift will be needed to posi-
tion the unit. Major features include the systems, subassemblies, and support-
ing equipment items identified in Figure 4.2. Descriptions of several key 
features are listed in subsequent paragraphs.

4.2.3. Electrical Power Input Cable. A 25-foot electrical power input cable 
is used to connect the FDECU to a source of electrical power for operation. 
The cable should be connected to a 3-phase, 208 VAC, 60 Amp power supply 
with ground. The power cable is stored on the inside of the FDECU when not 
in use. 
4.2.4. Sight Glass. The sight glass, or liquid refrigerant indicator shown in 
Figure 4.5, permits visual inspection of the liquid refrigerant passing through 
the system and is used to aid in diagnosing possible refrigerant system prob-
lems. The sight glass also contains an indicator that changes color depending 
upon the amount of moisture contained in the refrigerant. 
Figure 4.5. Sight Glass (or Liquid Refrigerant Indicator). 
 
4.2.5. Air Filter. The replaceable air filter is located in the return air flange 
assembly (Figure 4.6). The filter removes dust and debris from the shelter air 
as it passes through the FDECU.

level away from drafts or supply air opening. Seal any opening made in the 
shelter. If a mounting bracket is not available in the shelter, the bracket used 
to store the remote control box in the FDECU can be removed and mounted 
inside the shelter using standard hardware or clamps. If the bracket from the 
FDECU is removed, make sure to reinstall the bracket attachment hardware 
(screws, nuts, washers, etc.) back into the holes on the FDECU. 
 
4.3.3.9. Connect Air Ducts. Install the 9-foot-long supply air duct between 
the heater barrel and the shelter supply duct connector. Be sure the duct is 
installed with the airflow direction arrow pointed toward the shelter. After-
ward, secure the duct by tightening the two clamps. Install the 7-foot-long 
return air duct between the flange assembly and shelter return duct connector. 
The airflow direction arrow should be pointed toward the FDECU. The perfo-
rated holes in the flange assembly (Figure 4.16) are intended to provide from 
zero to 500 SCFM of fresh outside air to the shelter depending on how many, 
if any, holes are exposed. At least four or five rows of perforated holes should 
be exposed to assure a continuous supply of fresh make-up air. Position the 
air duct on the flange assembly as necessary and secure into place by tighten-
ing the clamps. 
4.3.3.10. Connect Input Power Cable Assembly. Connect the input power 
cable to a 208 VAC, 3-phase, 50/60 Hertz, 60 Amp power supply with 
ground (Figure 4.17). 
CAUTION 
Ice could form on the inside coil if airflow is re-
stricted. Ducts must be installed as straight as possible 
with a minimum number of bends. Unit performance 
will be affected and damage to equipment could occur 
if airflow is restricted.

4.4.2.2. To operate in the vent mode, push the vent mode button (Figure 
4.18) to activate the inside blower. The ON indicator light will illuminate and 
the shelter air will begin to circulate. This will not control the temperature. 
4.4.2.3. To operate in the climate control mode (heating and air conditioning); 
set the temperature knob (Figure 4.18) to about the one o’clock position or to 
―normal operation‖ on some models. This position is approximately 75o F. 
Then push the climate control button (Figure 4.18) to activate the automatic 
temperature control system. The ON indicator light will illuminate. In some 
instances, immediate operation may be prevented by the control logic time-
out circuit. If this occurs, do not turn the unit off; it should start automatically 
within 5 minutes. Note. For FDECU-2 models, if the compressor warm up 
indicator light (Figure 4.18) is illuminated, the compressor is still warming 
and will not operate. However, the unit will operate in vent or resistance heat 
mode.  
4.4.2.4. When the system is fully operating in the climate control mode, use 
the temperature knob to increase or decrease the shelter air temperature with-
in a range of 60o F to 100o F. The unit will maintain the temperature to within 
5o F of the setting. If the unit is operating in the cooling mode after start up, 
do not adjust the temperature knob for several hours until the shelter air tem-
perature stabilizes.  
4.4.2.5. If the inside coil ices over, operate the unit in the vent mode until the 
coil de-ices. For severe coil ice over, operate the unit in the heat mode (ap-
proximately 10-15 minutes) to de-ice the coil.  
4.4.3. Perform “During Operation” Checks. Once the FDECU is operating, 
make periodic checks according to Table 4.4.  
WARNING 
Rotating parts are used in operating the FDECU. Do 
not install or adjust return air duct when inside blower 
is operating. The flange assembly can disengage and 
come off, resulting in personal injury.

Table 4.4. FDECU “During Operation” PMCS. 
Check: 
Unserviceable If: 
Liquid Refrigerant Indicator 
(Sight Glass): Inspect the liquid 
refrigerant indicator port for con-
stant bubbles, foam, or to see if the 
center indicator color is red or yel-
low, depending on type of indica-
tor being used.  
The liquid refrigerant indicator 
port shows constant bubbles or 
foam or if the center indicator col-
or is red or yellow, depending on 
the type of indicator being used.  
Condensate Drain Hose: When in 
cooling mode, check that water is 
dripping from the hose end. If wa-
ter is dripping from other areas, 
notify unit maintenance. 
 
4.4.4. Operation under Unusual Conditions. Like many HVAC/R systems, 
environmental conditions may affect the operational efficiency of the FDECU. 
Conditions such as extreme heat or cold, snow, dust or sand storms, and CBRN 
agents or materials can present special challenges during FDECU operation. 
4.4.4.1. Extreme Heat. In extreme hot weather conditions, the load or strain 
on the FDECU can be significant. The best way to reduce demand on the 
system is to open and close the shelter as little as possible. If fresh outside 
make-up air is not required, position the return air duct over the perforated 
holes on the unit’s return air flange. Do not maintain the shelter temperature 
any lower than necessary. If possible, provide shade over the unit and always 
ensure there are no obstructions to airflow through the FDECU. 
4.4.4.2. Extreme Cold and Snow. Just as during extreme heat conditions, in 
extreme cold weather conditions, open and close the shelter as little as possi-
ble. Position the return air duct over the perforated holes on the return air 
flange if outside make-up air is not required. Make sure any openings in the 
shelter are sealed, and try not to maintain shelter temperature higher than 
necessary. In snowy conditions, the area around the unit should be kept clear 
to prevent obstructions caused by snow build-up. Additionally, when the unit 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009 
79 
defrosts ice from the outside coil, water drains from the bottom of the unit 
and could cause ice to build up and collect in this area. If not previously ac-
complished, it may be necessary to raise the unit to prevent water collection.  
 
4.4.4.3. Dust and Sand Storms. Although the FDECU does not require any 
special protection procedures against conditions such as dust and sand storms, 
the unit should be cleaned more frequently than under normal conditions. If 
fresh outside make-up air is not required, position the air duct over perforated 
holes on the return air flange. The return air filter will also require cleaning 
more frequently. 
4.4.4.4. CBRN Agents or Materials. Operating the FDECU in a CBRN en-
vironment requires the attachment of special blowers, filters and adapters. 
The unit should be operated according to instructions supplied with the 
CBRN adapter kit. Refer to T.O. 35E9-314-1 for specific procedures when 
configuring and operating the FDECU with CBRN equipment. 
4.5. Shutdown Procedures. FDECU shutdown procedures depend on which 
mode the unit is operating. If operating in the heating and air conditioning 
mode, push the climate control button to deactivate the automatic temperature 
control system. If operating in the ventilation mode, push the vent mode but-
ton to deactivate the inside blower. In both instances, the ON indicator light 
will go out after the button is pushed. Afterward, unclip the quick release pin 
on the fan cover door. Close and secure the door with the door fasteners.  
4.6. Preparation for Storage or Shipment. When FDECU operations are 
completed, several actions need to be accomplished before storing or shipping 
the unit. First, operate the FDECU in the vent mode for approximately one hour 
to ensure that any condensate is drained from the unit and to dry out the inside 
coil and ducts. Then, complete the following steps: 
CAUTION 
Extreme cold can cause electrical wire leads and insulation to become 
brittle. Do not disturb electrical wiring that has been exposed to ex-
tremely low temperatures because damage to wire leads or insulation 
could occur.

4.6.1. Shutdown the FDECU and disconnect it from the power source. 
4.6.2. If applicable, disconnect and secure CBRN adapter kit according to 
T.O. 35E9-314-1. 
4.6.3. Loosen the clamps and remove both air ducts. Be sure the ducts are 
dry, and then set the ducts and clamps aside for storage inside the unit. 
 
4.6.4. Raise and secure the FDECU cover. Make sure the hair cotter pin se-
curing the cover is installed into the rod from the top. 
4.6.5. If used, remove the remote control panel from the shelter and secure it 
inside the FDECU. Remember, if the remote control storage bracket from the 
FDECU was used to mount the remote control panel inside the shelter, it 
must be installed back into the unit. 
4.6.6. Install the supply and return air shipping covers in their reverse order 
of removal. Make sure the heater barrel is pushed inside the supply air volute 
and properly secured with the four quick-release pins. Position and secure 
both shipping covers with cover screws.  
4.6.7. Store the condensate drain hose in the reverse order it was removed. Be 
sure there is no water inside the hose and that the hose is coiled around the 
heater barrel for storage. 
WARNING 
The FDECU cover is heavy. Be sure the cover retain-
ing rod is in place and properly secured with the hair 
cotter pin. Injury can occur if the cover drops. 
WARNING 
Rotating parts and lethal voltage levels are used in 
operating the FDECU. Be sure power source is dis-
connected after shutdown. Injury or death can occur if 
connected to power source.

130K MULTI-FUELED PORTABLE HEATER 
 
5.1. General Information. The 130K Portable Heater (Figure 5.1) is the 
main heater for BEAR sets. Its principle purpose is to provide heated air for 
shelters and working areas. As indicated by its name, the heater has a heated 
air output of 130,000 BTUH at 0o F and is capable of burning several types of 
fuel. The overall design concept of the heater is modular. All major compo-
nents are easily accessible for maintenance and can be easily removed and 
installed. Because the heater uses a fuel-fired system, operators should exer-
cise extreme care and observe all technical order warnings and cautions to 
ensure safe operation.  
Figure 5.1. 130K Heater. 
 
5.2. Characteristics and Features. The unit is a fully enclosed, skid-
mounted heater with three temperature ranges: high, medium, and low. The 
basic design of the heater features a separate electric-motor-driven oil burner 
with separate blower for combustion air and an electric-motor-driven heater 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009 
83 
blower. It uses 120 Volts, 50/60 Hz generator or commercial power to oper-
ate the oil burner and combustion air blower. The heater will deliver hot air at 
a minimum of 1000 cubic feet per minute (CFM) and at temperatures ranging 
from 80o F to 180o F. The heated air output performance of the 130K heater 
makes it ideal for use during extremely cold conditions. Other external and 
internal features include the following. 
5.2.1. External Features: Listed below and illustrated in Figure 5.2.  
5.2.1.1. Covers. The sheet metal covers protect internal components of the 
heater from open environments. Top covers for the combustion chamber/heat 
exchanger and blower are easily removed, allowing easy access to major 
components. The control panel/burner compartment has a hinged cover panel. 
5.2.1.2. Frame. The heater is constructed with an upper and lower frame. The 
lower frame has an integrated skid for easy maneuverability, and fork-lift 
boxes that are accessible from the long sides of the heater. 
5.2.1.3. Fuel Tank and Fuel Gauge. The all-metal, on-board fuel tank is 
located in the lower frame and has a storage capacity of 21 gallons. The fuel 
gauge is a mechanical, float-type gauge and is part of the fuel fill cap. The 
gauge is easily viewed without opening any heater covers. 
5.2.1.4. Air Inlet and Outlet. Shelter or facility air returns to the heater 
through the circulation air inlet, and heated air is supplied to the shelter or 
facility via the heated air outlet. 
5.2.1.5. Power Cable. The power cable extends from the burner compartment 
and plugs into a 120 Volt, 20 Amp maximum power source. The green indi-
cator light on the control panel verifies the presence of voltage. 
5.2.1.6. Exhaust Outlet. Combustion fumes, which are completely separated 
from heated air, exit through the exhaust outlet at the top of the heater.

Figure 5.2. External Features. 
 
5.2.2. Internal Features: Listed below and illustrated in Figure 5.3. 
5.2.2.1. Fuel Feed Hose (External Tank). The heater is equipped with an al-
ternative fuel feed hose for attachment to an external fuel tank. The on-board or 
external fuel tank is selected using a 3-way valve attached to the fuel lines. 
5.2.2.2. Fuel Filter. The fuel filter lies between the 3-way valve and the 
fuel injection pump. It filters fuel from both the external and on-board fuel 
tanks before the fuel is pumped into the burner nozzle. 
 
 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009 
85 
5.2.2.3. Fuel Burner and Burner Control Unit. The fuel burner is a stan-
dard, commercial fuel burner. It consists of an electric motor to drive the 
combustion air blower and high-pressure fuel injection pump, and an igni-
tion transformer, both of which are visible and accessible from outside of 
the burner frame. The burner control unit (BCU) is a microprocessor-
equipped control unit located inside the heater control box. The BCU con-
trols the function and safety of the fuel burner. 
Figure 5.3. Internal Features. 
 
5.2.2.4. Main Air Blower. The heater blower operates at a nominal 1000 
CFM and forces heated air through the heater housing, around the burner 
chamber, and through the heat exchanger. Thermal energy is transferred 
from the hot surfaces of the combustion components into the circulating air. 
The heated air is supplied to the facility via the flexible ducts. The blower’s 
electric motor is 120 Volt, 50/60 Hz, running at 1700 Revolutions per 
Minute (RPM). 
 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23April 2009 
 
86 
5.2.2.5. Combustion Chamber. The heater combustion chamber houses 
the fuel burner tube and provides an exit route for exhaust gases. Flame is 
contained inside the burner chamber, thus only hot exhaust gases exit the 
chamber to the heat exchanger. 
5.2.2.6. Heat Exchanger. Hot combustion exhaust gases from the combus-
tion chamber pass through the heat exchanger during burner operation. 
Thermal energy is conducted and transferred into discharge air, which is 
blown past the heat exchanger channels by the main air blower. Exhaust 
gases remain completely separated from the heated air, and the gases exit 
through the exhaust outlet and into open air. 
5.2.2.7. External Thermostat and Carbon Monoxide (CO) Monitor. The 
external thermostat and CO Monitor (Figure 5.4) are critical components of 
the heater unit. The external thermostat remotely controls heater operation 
when the mode switch on the control panel is set to ―AUTO.‖ The CO 
Monitor continuously checks the level of carbon monoxide within the shel-
ter or facility and sounds an alarm if permitted levels are exceeded. The 
heater unit should never be used without a properly located and functioning 
CO Monitor. The thermostat/monitor should hang in a central position 
within the shelter or facility being heated. 
Figure 5.4. External Thermostat and CO Monitor.

5.2.2.8. Control Panel. The heater control panel is the top portion of the 
heater control box, and it is located just underneath the burner/control panel 
access door. The control panel contains the heater control switch, heater 
mode switch, panel light and switch, heater hour meter, flame failure reset 
button, and digital display. Figure 5.5 and Table 5.1 highlight the compo-
nent functions on the control panel. Table 5.2 describes the meaning of

5.3. Set-Up Procedures. Specific steps to set up the heater are as follows. 
 
5.3.1. Siting the 130K Heater. Place the heater in an operating position near 
the shelter or desired structure (Figure 5.6). Select a location that is as level 
as possible not exceeding eight degrees in any direction. Attempt to avoid 
locating the heater in the path of normal shelter or facility pedestrian traffic, 
and leave adequate room for operation, maintenance, and refueling of the 
heater unit. When positioning the unit next to the desired facility, be sure to 
position air ducts in a manner that avoids sharp bends or kinks. Kinks in the 
air ducts impede airflow and decrease efficiency.  
Figure 5.6. 130K Heater Sited Near Tent. 
 
5.3.2. Preparation for Use and Preliminary Adjustments. When preparing 
the heater for use, complete the following checks and preliminary adjustments 
before operating the heater unit. 
CAUTION 
When using a forklift to move the heater, ensure the 
forklift tines are in the forklift pockets provided and 
extend completely under the heater unit. Failure to 
comply may result in serious equipment damage. 
 
 
 
AFH 10-222 Volume 12, 23 April 2009

5.3.2.5. Connect the external thermostat/CO monitor cable into the receptacle 
under the control box. Bring the thermostat/CO monitor combination into the 
space being heated. Do not place the external thermostat in the direct vicinity 
of the warm air discharge duct. Instead, hang the thermostat/CO monitor in a 
central position. When power is applied, make sure the green ―POWER‖ light 
is ON in the CO monitor and the alarm sounds for a few seconds, indicating 
that the monitor is activated. If the green ―POWER‖ light does not illuminate 
when power is applied to the CO monitor or the alarm fails to sound when the 
―TEST‖ button is pushed, change the monitor before using the heater. CO 
monitor function can also be tested by briefly pushing the ―TEST‖ button. 
The alarm should sound when the button is pushed. 
 
 
 
WARNING 
Never operate the heater without a functional carbon 
monoxide (CO) monitor properly connected and lo-
cated. Failure to comply may result in bodily injury or 
death. 
WARNING 
The CO monitor is a delicate, calibrated instrument, so 
do not attempt any repairs. Change the monitor if it is 
defective. Failure to comply may result in bodily in-
jury or death. 
WARNING 
Dangerous voltages are present at electric system con-
nectors. Ensure power is OFF (power cable discon-
nected) prior to connecting or disconnecting cables or 
wires.

5.4. Operation. The heater operating controls and indicators are located on 
the control panel. Access the heater controls by opening the burner/control 
panel compartment cover on the top, right side of the heater. Note. Do not 
operate the heater without air ducts installed, except during maintenance. 
 
5.4.1. Connect the power cable plug into a 120 Volt, 60/50 Hz, 20 Amp (max-
imum) power source. Open the control panel cover and verify the green indi-
cator light is illuminated. 
5.4.2. Once power is supplied to the heater, set the mode switch on the con-
trol panel to either ―AUTO‖ for remote thermostat-controlled operation or 
―MANUAL‖ for constant outlet temperature. If the ―MANUAL mode is 
selected, turn the heat control switch to the desired outlet temperature (see 
Table 5.4). If in the ―AUTO‖ mode, turn the heat control switch to ―HIGH‖ 
and set the desired temperature on the remote thermostat. 
5.4.3. Make sure the remote thermostat is located in a central place within the 
space to be heated. Note. Do not place the external thermostat in the direct 
vicinity of the warm air discharge duct. 
WARNING 
If the heater is operated for maintenance inside a building, exhaust gases 
must be vented to the outside by means of a suitable exhaust vent system. 
Do not apply a forced-draft (suction) type exhaust system directly to the 
heat exchanger exhaust. Utilize an exhaust hood or locally manufacture 
an exhaust vent adapter to mate with facilities exhaust venting system. 
The exhaust vent adapter must provide a minimum of 6 inches of free air 
space between the upper end of the exhaust stack and the hood. Failure to 
comply could result in bodily injury or death. 
WARNING 
The heater is unsafe for operation in explosive atmos-
pheres. Attempting to start the heater in an explosive 
atmosphere may result in bodily injury or death.

5.5. Shutdown Procedures. Always position the mode switch to 
―MANUAL‖ before shutting down the heater. Then turn the heat control 
switch to ―STOP‖ and allow the heater to perform its after-cooling function 
(ACF). When the display message reads ―OFF‖ and the blower has stopped, 
disconnect the heater power cable. After that, close and latch the control 
panel cover. In the event of an emergency or fire, disconnect the power 
cable to perform an emergency heater shutdown. Although this action may 
damage the heater’s combustion components, it is the safest and quickest 
way to terminate heater operations in an emergency. 
5.6. Preparation for Storage or Shipment. Perform the following procedures 
when preparing the heater for storage or shipment. 
WARNING 
Heater can generate enough heat in certain locations to 
cause severe burns upon physical contact. Allow heater 
to cool before touching. 
CAUTION 
When shutting down the heater, do not disconnect the 
power cable from the power source until the panel dis-
play message reads ―OFF.‖ Disconnecting the cable be-
fore the display reads ―OFF‖ may damage combustion 
components.

5.6.1. Disconnect the power cable from the power source. Coil the cable and 
stow it in the heater burner compartment. 
5.6.2. Drain the fuel from the fuel tank by opening the drain plug on the tank 
(Figure 5.11) and draining the fuel contents into a suitable container. 
Figure 5.11. Fuel Tank Drain. 
 
5.6.3. Remove the air ducts from the heater. Compress ducts and secure them 
with hook and loop provided inside ducts (Figure 5.12) to secure in transport 
configuration. 
Figure 5.12. Ducts Secured with Hook and Loop. 
 
5.6.4. Cover the heater air inlet and outlet adapters with the adapter covers 
(Figure 5.13).

5.6.5. Remove the external thermostat from the shelter. Coil the cable and insert 
the cable and thermostat into heater burner compartment. 
5.6.6. If the external fuel feed hose was used, remove the hose from the external 
fuel container, coil the hose, then stow the hose in the burner compartment. 
5.6.7. Remove the flue gas exhaust extension, and cover the heater exhaust 
outlet with the steel cap provided. 
5.6.8. The remaining packing procedures are dependent on the method of 
shipment. When preparing the heater unit for air shipment, make sure the fuel 
tank cap is installed and properly tightened and the air vent hole is open and 
unobstructed. This action will permit pressure equalization during altitude 
and temperature changes. Refer to T.O. 35E7-3-4-1 and T.O. 35-1-4, 
Processing and Inspection of Aerospace Ground Equipment for Storage and 
Shipment, for more information on preparing the heater unit for storage or 
shipment.
