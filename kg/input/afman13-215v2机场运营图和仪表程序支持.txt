Chapter 2 
MINIMUM VECTORING ALTITUDE CHARTS (MVAC) AND MINIMUM 
INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES ALTITUDE CHART (MIFRAC) 
2.1.  General.   MVACs and MIFRACs are developed and maintained by TERPS authorities as 
directed by ATC facility management using the Chart Designer module of Global Procedure 
Designer (GPD) software. MVACs and MIFRACs do not require flight inspection. For more 
technical information on GPD software, see T.O. 31S5-4-6210-1, USAF Global Procedure 
Designer (USAFGPD) Operations Manual. 
2.1.1.  Minimum Vectoring Altitude Chart. Establish Minimum Vectoring Altitude Chart 
(MVAC)s IAW this chapter and FAA Order 7210.3AA, Facility Operation and 
Administration, Chapter 3, Section 8, Other Displays as appropriate. The MVAC is used in a 
RADAR environment to determine the lowest useable Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) altitude 
at which an aircraft may be vectored and maintain clearance from obstructions, terrain and 
uncontrolled airspace. 
2.1.1.1.  AF TERPS are not required to develop MVACs at AF locations where host nation 
or the FAA provide terminal RADAR service e.g., a USAF Visual Flight Rules (VFR) 
control tower. However, they are required to obtain a copy of the FAA, host nation MVAC 
or suitable alternative documentation for reference when developing instrument 
procedures. (T-3). 
2.1.1.2.  TERPS functions required to develop MVACs shall consider the adjacent ATC 
facilities MVAC when developing the USAF chart to prevent excessive altitude changes 
between the two facilities’ adjoining MVAC sectors. (T-3). 
2.1.1.3.  When developing MVACs for Digital Airport Surveillance RADAR 
(DASR)/Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), enter the DASR 
magnetic variation (MV) of record for the DASR, not STARS equipment. 
2.1.2.  Definitions and chart types. 
2.1.2.1.  Terminal MVAC. 
2.1.2.1.1.  This chart supports those systems where RADAR data is provided by a feed 
from a single short range (terminal) Airport Surveillance RADAR (ASR) or DASR 
antenna. Instrument Procedure Specialist will develop terminal MVACs for legacy 
analog RADARs (GPN-27) and mobile ASRs (MPN-14, MPN-25 and TPN-19), and 
DASR (GPN-30). (T-2). Terminal MVAC rules may also be used for multi-sensor 
mosaic systems where RADAR data from a single terminal RADAR is selected or 
adapted. 
2.1.2.1.2.  Develop terminal MVACs for a single-sensor terminal RADAR mode and 
for designated terminal areas where the area is adapted to utilize a single terminal 
RADAR. (T-2). Three nautical miles lateral separation will be provided from terrain 
and obstructions (sector buffer) within 40 nautical miles of the ASR/DASR and five 
nautical miles lateral separation will be provided 40 nautical miles and greater from the 
chart center. (T-1). A terminal MVAC is centered on the terminal ASR/DASR antenna 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
7 
in order for GPD to determine where to apply the increase in lateral separation to five 
nautical miles. 
2.1.2.1.3.  For a terminal area where ATC has the ability to switch from single-sensor 
to multi-sensor mode, an en route MVAC must be developed. (T-1). When 
operationally advantageous, both a terminal and en route MVAC may be developed. 
2.1.2.2.  En Route MVAC. This chart supports those systems where RADAR data is 
provided by a feed from one or more long range (en route) Air Route Surveillance RADAR 
antennas, or a feed from more than one terminal RADAR. Develop en route MVACs for 
multi-sensor mosaic systems such as Microprocessor En Route Automated RADAR or 
STARS, except for the adapted terminal area specified in paragraph 2.1.2.1.(T-2). When a 
terminal MVAC is developed for the terminal area or the single-sensor mode of a multi-
sensor system, develop and maintain both terminal and en route MVACs. Five nautical 
miles lateral separation is provided from terrain and obstructions (sector buffer) regardless 
of the distance from the chart center or aerodrome. 
2.1.2.3.  FUSION-based MVAC. This chart supports multi-sensor (multiple radar feeds 
and ASDB when facility enhanced) systems enabling more precise aircraft targeting. 
FUSION allows for a continuous 3 nautical mile or 5 nautical mile MVAC buffers 
throughout the entire radar presentation, regardless of antenna distances. It is recomended 
to develop FUSION MVACs with 3 nautical mile or 5 nautical mile buffers in GPD under 
the Terminal MVAC module by selecting a desired airspace range to the extent of the work 
area and then selecting 3 nautical mile or 5 nautical mile buffers as appropriate. This will 
prevent auto-triggering of the 5 nautical mile buffers at 40 nautical mile. For the 
appropriate FUSION buffer selection and requirements see, FAA Order 7210.3AA, 
Facility Operation and Administration, Chapter 3, Section 8, Other Displays as appropriate. 
2.1.3.  Standard sector. A sector bounded by two bearings and two ranges (arcs) relative to 
chart center. 
2.1.4.  Irregular sector. A more complex sector bounded by more than two bearings and two 
ranges relative to chart center. 
2.1.5.  Polygonal sector. A sector defined by the World Geodetic System-84 coordinates of 
each corner (vertex). There is no limit to the number of sides to this type sector. 
2.1.6.  Prominent obstacle sector. This is a “buffer” sector intended to provide the required 
vertical and lateral clearance from a single, isolated, man-made obstacle. When a single, 
isolated, man-made obstacle causes the entire sector altitude to be higher than desired, a 
prominent obstacle sector may be established. A prominent obstacle sector may be contained 
within a single larger sector, or overlap several adjacent sectors and can be based on an obstacle 
that is outside the MVAC radius but within the buffer area of the sector. 
2.1.6.1.  This sector type is only authorized to provide separation from an isolated, man-
made obstacle that is higher than surrounding terrain or obstructions (Figure 2.1). Note: 
All obstacles inside the prominent obstacle sector, except those obstacles that fall within 
the horizontal accuracy of the obstacle upon which the prominent obstacle sector is based, 
are evaluated when determining the minimum altitude of the sector(s) surrounding or 
adjoining the prominent obstacle sector.

2.1.7.  Chart design. 
2.1.7.1.  Determine which type chart (Terminal, En Route, or both) is applicable based on 
paragraph 2.1.2. Instrument Procedure Specialist will establish MVACs irrespective of the 
flight-checked RADAR coverage in the sector concerned; they are based on obstruction 
clearance criteria and controlled airspace only. (T-2). It is the responsibility of ATC to 
determine that a target return is adequate for RADAR control purposes. It is not relevant 
to MVAC development whether RADAR service in a specific area is provided using 
primary or secondary RADAR. 
2.1.7.1.1.  For a Terminal MVAC, Instrument Procedure Specialist will ensure the area 
considered for obstacle clearance (chart radius) encompasses the maximum range of 
the ASR primary RADAR and be extended to include all delegated airspace. (T-3). 
This includes adjacent areas where control responsibility is assumed because of early 
handoff or track initiation. Exception: When developing a Terminal MVAC to support 
the designated terminal area of a multi-sensor system (paragraph 2.1.2), the area only 
needs be large enough to include the entire terminal area to include the appropriate 
buffer area based on the distance from the ASR/DASR. 
2.1.7.1.2.  For an En Route MVAC, Instrument Procedure Specialist will ensure the 
area considered for obstacle clearance (chart radius) shall be large enough to include 
20 nautical miles beyond delegated airspace boundaries to include adjacent areas where 
control responsibility is assumed because of early handoff or track initiation. (T-2). 
When developing an En Route MVAC, ensure that “Multi-sensor” is selected in the 
chart properties of GPD to ensure the proper buffer size is constructed. 
2.1.7.2.  To aid in determining the appropriate chart radius, delegated ATC airspace may 
be entered into GPD Data Manager as a new, unclassified airspace. (See T.O. 31S5-4-
6210-1, USAF Global Procedure Designer (USAFGPD) Operations Manual.) 
2.1.7.3.  Define the chart properties. Specify whether the default terrain type for the chart 
is designated mountainous or non-mountainous IAW Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 95, Designated Mountainous Areas in the Continental United States (CONUS). 
Outside the CONUS, review the appropriate host nation Aeronautical Information 
Publication (AIP) or other applicable directives and comply with mountainous terrain 
designations. When the host nation has not explicitly defined terrain type designations, 
evaluate the topography of the area to determine if it is a mountainous area as defined by 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (3000 feet of terrain elevation change 
within a distance of 10 nautical miles). Additionally, check host nation en route charts (host 
and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) to ascertain that the required obstacle 
clearance (ROC) is applied on air traffic service routes and to off-route altitudes such as 
minimum off-route altitude and off-route obstruction clearance altitude. Make a 
determination which terrain type is appropriate and document the rationale in the chart’s 
user defined notes. 
 
 
10 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
2.1.7.3.1.  Apply mountainous terrain obstacle clearance per FAA Order 8260.3D, 
United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Chapter 2, Level 
OCS, Chapter 11, MVAC Obstacle Clearance and Altitude Selection. When non-
mountainous terrain is specified, 1000 feet of ROC is applied as the system default. 
When mountainous terrain is specified, 2000 feet of ROC is applied as the system 
default. 
2.1.7.3.2.  Where lower altitudes are necessary in designated mountainous areas to 
achieve compatibility with terminal routes or to permit vectoring to an instrument 
approach, the default ROC may be reduced to 1000 feet for a Terminal MVAC, and 
1500 feet or 1700 feet for an En Route MVAC as specified in FAA Order 8260.3D 
section 15-2. Instrument Procedure Specialist will annotate each sector with the 
statement “ROC reduced to less than 2000 feet” in the appropriate sector defined notes. 
(T-2). 
2.1.7.4.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will specify the appropriate allowance for trees 
and this allowance will be applied uniformly to the entire terrain model. (T-2). Where 
vegetation is sparse, or has variable heights, or when using Shuttle RADAR Topography 
Mission, it may be preferable to add assumptions for vegetation to the sector altitude rather 
than entering a tree allowance to the entire area. This choice should be document in the 
designer notes to posterity. For additional guidance about vegetation (tree) allowance, see:  
AFMAN (formerly AFI) 11-230, chapter 2. 
2.1.7.5.  Specify standard, irregular, or polygonal sectors or any combination thereof based 
on the terrain, obstacle and airspace environment or other operational requirements 
(RADAR patterns, noise abatement areas, Special Use Airspace [SUA], etc.). Ensure sector 
coverage over the entire chart with no gaps between sectors. With the exception of a 
prominent obstacle sector, each sector’s boundary must adjoin, but not overlap, the 
boundary of each adjacent sector. (T-2). In some cases it may be desirable to combine 
adjacent smaller areas having different altitudes into a single large area with one altitude. 
See Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. 
2.1.7.5.1.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will make each obstacle sector, except for 
prominent obstacle sectors, large enough to permit the efficient and safe vectoring of 
aircraft. Consideration should be given to aircraft performance and phase of flight. (T-
2). 
2.1.7.5.2.  There is no limitation to what sector types may be developed for either a 
terminal or en route MVAC. For example, polygonal sectors can be established for a 
terminal chart, and standard sectors can be defined for en route. However, when MVAC 
sector design impacts low altitude alert system (LAAS), consider low altitude alert 
development limitations. Coordinate with ATC automation personnel when applicable 
to determine optimum sector design. 
2.1.7.6.  Specify sector altitudes no less than the minimum altitude. The selected altitude 
shall provide at least the ROC above obstructions and terrain plus vegetation allowance in 
the sector, including buffer, and must be at least 300 feet above the highest floor of 
controlled airspace (FOCA) in the sector, not including buffer, rounded to the higher 100- 
foot increment. (T-2). 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
11 
2.1.7.6.1.  FOCA in mountainous areas or sparsely populated areas may be as high as 
14,500 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). When the minimum altitude is higher than desired 
due to a high FOCA, and when operationally required by ATC (i.e., routinely expected 
to vector aircraft in Class G uncontrolled airspace), two sector altitudes may be 
established. Instrument Procedure Specialist will base one sector altitude on the FOCA, 
and the second sector altitude on obstruction clearance. (T-2). 
2.1.7.6.2.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will not add the vegetation allowance to the 
terrain values used for FOCA determination. (T-2). 
2.1.7.7.  Host nations may detail FOCA in their AIPs or other sources, however some 
compute this data differently than US criteria. Check with appropriate host nation 
personnel to ensure accurate information is applied. When a host nation does not designate 
the FOCA, controlled airspace is considered to begin at the surface. Document in the 
chart’s user defined notes and, when available, include a hard copy version of the host 
nation’s airspace description in the chart package.

Figure 2.4.  Minimum Vectoring Altitude Chart with Polygonal Sectors. 
 
2.2.  Minimum Instrument Flight Rules Altitude Chart.  The MIFRAC is used to determine the 
lowest useable IFR altitude at which an aircraft may operate, receive the appropriate Navigation 
Aid (NAVAID), and maintain clearance from obstructions, terrain and uncontrolled airspace in a 
non-RADAR environment. Note:  Minimum IFR altitudes are only intended for off-route and 
direct-route operations. The Minimum En Route Altitude or Minimum Obstruction Clearance 
Altitude in a particular area has no impact on MIFRAC design. 
2.2.1.  Chart Design. Develop a MIFRAC centered on each omni-directional NAVAID 
(Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), VHF Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation 
(VORTAC), VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) or Non-directional Radio Beacon) used for 
non-RADAR operations. 
 
 
14 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
2.2.1.1.  Do not exceed the standard service volume of the NAVAID.  The existence of an 
expanded service volume has no bearing on MIFRAC design unless approved for an entire 
area or sector in which off-route operations are conducted. The area considered for obstacle 
clearance (chart radius) must be large enough to encompass the standard NAVAID service 
volume for the highest altitude where control responsibility is routinely assumed. (T-2). 
The chart radius shall encompass all delegated airspace to include adjacent areas where 
control responsibility is assumed. (T-2).  For standard service volumes, see 8260.19H 
paragraph 2-4-2. 
2.2.1.2.  Specify the default terrain type IAW paragraph 2.1.7.3 and the vegetation 
allowance IAW paragraph 2.1.7.4. 
2.2.1.3.  When a MVAC is available, associate the MIFRAC in chart properties of GPD. 
This ensures the MIFRAC sector altitudes are no lower than the MVAC. 
2.2.1.4.  Specify standard or irregular sectors or any combination based on the terrain, 
obstacle, airspace environment, MVAC and other operational requirements (RADAR 
patterns, noise abatement areas, SUA, etc.). GPD requires sector coverage over the entire 
chart with no gaps between sectors and each sector’s boundary adjoin, and not overlap the 
boundary of each adjacent sector. In some cases, it may be desirable to combine adjacent 
smaller areas having different altitudes into a single large area with one altitude (Figure 
2.6). Note: There is no “Terminal” or “En Route” distinction for MIFRACs; 5 nautical 
miles lateral separation (buffer area) is provided from terrain and obstructions regardless 
of the distance to the facility. 
2.2.1.5.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will specify only one sector altitude in each sector 
no less than the minimum altitude. (T-2). This minimum altitude shall provide at least the 
required ROC above obstructions and terrain plus vegetation allowance in the sector, 
including buffer, and must be at least 300 feet above the highest FOCA in the sector, not 
including buffer, rounded to the higher 100-foot increment. (T-2). The selected MIFRAC 
sector altitude shall not be lower than the highest Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) for 
that given area. (T-3). Note 1: When determining MIFRAC sector altitudes, do not include 
MIFRAC sector buffer areas when evaluating the associated underlying MVAC sectors. 
Note 2: CAUTION: Two or more MVA altitudes may affect a single MIFRAC sector. 
Annotate each sector where paragraph 2.1.7.3.2 is applied with the statement “ROC 
reduced to less than 2000” (Figure 2.7). 
2.2.1.6.  Consider restrictions noted on flight inspection reports or Aviation Standards 
Information System datasheet (i.e., horizontal and vertical NAVAID limitations to include 
unusable sectors) when determining sector design and when specifying sector altitudes 
(Figure 2.5). For example, for the first restriction shown in Figure 2.5, the MIFRAC sector 
from R-130 clockwise to R-160 beyond 29 nautical miles out to the chart radius can’t be 
lower than 9000 feet MSL regardless of the minimum altitude specified by GPD. When 
flight inspection designates that no coverage exists in an area, annotate the sector as 
unusable.

Chapter 3 
LOW ALTITUDE ALERT SYSTEM (LAAS) 
3.1.  General.  LAAS uses visual and aural alarms to alert the controller when a RADAR track 
target with mode C is below a predetermined safe altitude. Mode C is additional aircraft 
transponder equipage that transmits altitude data to the visual and aural alarm system. LAAS 
automatically processes all tracked targets with an operational mode C unless the controller 
exempts the target from processing. Instrument Procedure Specialist will perform a manual 
validation of LAAS data whenever the MVAC is re-accomplished. (T-2). 
3.1.1.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducts flight inspection of LAAS in 
accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Order (FAA Order) 8200.1D. LAAS checks 
are associated with the corresponding terminal RADAR system. LAAS inspections are a check 
of the system, not of the adequacy of specific sector altitudes (sector altitudes maybe referred 
to as “bin altitudes” by flight inspection). 
3.1.2.  The FAA Order 8200.1D refers to LAAS as “Local Area Augmentation System” which 
has no correlation to low altitude alert. As such, LAAS in this context may be misunderstood 
by flight inspection personnel. This order does refer to Minimum Safe Altitude Warning 
Systems (MSAW). When coordinating with flight inspection, ensure that all correspondence 
clearly identifies the requirement as a request for a check of the low altitude alert 
system/MSAW. 
3.2.  Low Altitude Alert System. 
3.2.1.  LAAS associated with Digital Bright RADAR Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE). 
Only develop LAAS for those DBRITE systems authorized to provide additional RADAR 
functions beyond those normally allowed for certified tower displays IAW AFMAN 13-204 
(formerly AFI), Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, Volume 3 and FAA Order JO 
7110.65X, Air Traffic Control. Submit original and change request packages through the 
MAJCOM TERPS office in time for receipt by AFFSA Airfield Automation Ops Support at 
least 7 days prior to the effective date. Address all email correspondence concerning DBRITE 
LAAS to: HQAFFSA.AFSTARSOSF.MaintTeam@us.af.mil with “LAAS request” in the 
subject line. 
3.2.2.  Develop LAAS using appropriate charts based on processor capability, terrain, and local 
operating needs. After the data is processed, AFFSA Airfield Automation Ops Support 
forwards copies of computer-generated 15 nautical miles and 60 nautical miles charts to the 
requestor. These charts represent the data included as part of the operational program for the 
facility. The Instrument Procedure Specialist shall review the printout for accuracy, then sign 
and date. (T-3). When changes are required, the MAJCOM shall submit corrections to AFFSA 
Airfield Automation Ops Support. (T-2). 
3.2.2.1.  DBRITE LAAS packages are subject to equipment-specific radial/range 
restrictions (Figure 3.1. through Figure 3.6.). Figure 3.1. shows the identification of 
runways, Class C/D airspace, along with final, intermediate and/or initial approach areas 
out to the descent point. Figure 3.2. identifies general LAAS areas based on assigned 
airspace and MVA sectors. Figure 3.3. through Figure 3.6. illustrate the azimuth and range 
identification process. 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
19 
3.2.2.2.  DBRITE LAAS packages consist of an Approach Area Detail Map (AADM), a 
General Terrain Map (GTM), and a completed DBRITE LAAS Data Submission Sheet 
Checklist. Center all LAAS maps on the ASR antenna serving the airport for which the 
LAAS is being developed. All distances will be developed in nautical miles and all bearings 
are magnetic from the ASR antenna. 
3.2.2.3.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will ensure DBRITE LAAS coverage 
encompasses the ATC facility’s assigned airspace, special use airspace where ATC 
controls IFR aircraft and any areas where agreements with adjacent ATC facilities allow 
for the control of IFR aircraft. (T-3). Instrument Procedure Specialist will ensure the LAAS 
GTM drawings clearly depict these airspace boundaries/areas. (T-3). 
3.2.2.4.  Develop two maps centered on the ASR antenna: an AADM and a GTM. 
3.2.2.4.1.  The AADM defines the LAAS circling areas and approach courses to the 
primary airport (normally 0 – 15 nautical miles). It is large enough to include all 
approaches out to the applicable descent points. 
3.2.2.4.2.  The GTM (normally 15 – 60 nautical miles) - defines all other LAAS areas 
(i.e., larger, less-detailed MVAC sectors). It covers the airspace from edge of the 
AADM out to the limits of the areas defined in paragraph 3.2.2.3., not to exceed 60 
nautical miles from the ASR antenna. 
3.2.2.5.  DBRITE LAAS chart design. 
3.2.2.5.1.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will draw all final approach courses to 
airports within the facility’s assigned airspace (Figure 3.1.). (T-2). 
3.2.2.5.2.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will define the LAAS exempt areas by 
drawing a four nautical mile circle around the ASR antenna at the primary airport, and 
around each satellite airport’s airport reference point. (T-3). The altitude within these 
areas are set at zero. LAAS exempt areas eliminate nuisance alarms from aircraft 
descending on final approach and from aircraft climbing after departure or low 
approach/touch and go. 
3.2.2.5.3.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will plot the point on each instrument 
approach procedure where the aircraft descends below the MVA (Figure 3.1). (T-2) 
This point is referred to as the descent point. Determine the descent point as follows: 
3.2.2.5.3.1.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will work outwards from the airport 
to find the first published fix with an altitude that is equal to or higher than the 
MVA. (T-2). If this fix is within the LAAS exempt area (4 nautical mile from the 
ASR antenna or the airport reference point), no further action is necessary. 
3.2.2.5.3.2.  When the fix falls outside of the LAAS exempt area and the altitude is 
equal to the MVA, the fix becomes the descent point. (T-2). If the altitude at this 
fix is above the MVA, work inwards towards the missed approach point using the 
maximum authorized descent gradient until reaching the MVA and that point then 
becomes the descent point. (T-2). If the descent point then falls within the LAAS 
exempt area, no further action is necessary. 
3.2.2.5.4.  When the descent point falls outside the LAAS exempt area Instrument 
Procedure Specialist will take the following action: 
20 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
3.2.2.5.4.1.  When the descent point falls between the LAAS exempt area and the 
FAF (Final Approach Fix)/Precise FAF (PFAF), Instrument Procedure Specialist 
will draw the final approach primary trapezoid from the LAAS exempt area 
outward to the descent point. (T-2). Note: Assign an altitude for LAAS processing 
within the primary trapezoid that is at or above the lowest published minimum 
decent altitude for that runway (rounded nearest 100 foot), and that is at least 200 
feet above terrain and obstructions. 
3.2.2.5.4.2.  When the descent point falls between the FAF and the intermediate fix, 
Instrument Procedure Specialist will draw the final and intermediate primary 
trapezoids from the LAAS exempt area outward to the descent point. (T-2) 
3.2.2.5.4.2.1.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will assign an altitude for LAAS 
processing within the final primary trapezoid IAW paragraph 3.2.2.5.4.1. (T-2) 
3.2.2.5.4.2.2.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will assign an altitude for LAAS 
processing within the intermediate primary trapezoid that is no lower than 100 
feet below the lowest published FAF crossing altitude for that runway, and that 
is at least 300 feet above terrain and obstructions. (T-2). 
3.2.2.5.4.3.  When the descent point falls between the intermediate fix and the 
initial approach fix, Instrument Procedure Specialist will draw the final, 
intermediate and initial primary trapezoids from the LAAS exempt area outward to 
the descent point. (T-2). 
3.2.2.5.4.3.1.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will assign an altitude for LAAS 
processing within the final and intermediate primary trapezoid IAW paragraph 
3.2.2.5.4.1. and paragraph 3.2.2.5.4.2.2. (T-2).  
3.2.2.5.4.3.2.  Instrument Procedure Specialist  will assign an altitude for LAAS 
processing within the initial primary trapezoid that is no lower than 200 feet 
below the lowest published intermediate fix crossing altitude for that runway, 
and that is at least 300 feet above terrain and obstructions. (T-2). 
3.2.2.5.4.4.  For all other areas, assign an altitude for LAAS processing that is no 
lower than 200 feet below the MVA, and is at least 700 feet above terrain and 
obstacles (1700 feet in designated mountainous terrain). Note: When two MVA 
altitudes are assigned to the same sector (paragraph 2.1.7.6.), the Instrument 
Procedure Specialist will ensure the LAAS sector altitude will be based on the 
highest MVA in the sector. (T-2). 
3.2.2.6.  LAAS Sector Data Collection. 
3.2.2.6.1.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will define the boundaries of each LAAS 
sector by two ASR bearings (start and end) and by two ranges (start and end). Depict 
all LAAS sectors as either pie- shaped, truncated pie-shaped, or a circle around the 
point of origin (ASR). Using Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.5 as examples, Instrument 
Procedure Specialist will draw bearings to encompass all areas identified in paragraph 
3.2.2.3. When able, combine bearings/ranges to reduce the number of bearings and 
ranges used. Instrument Procedure Specialist will ensure continuous sectors do not 
cross the 0 degree bearing or 360 degree bearings. Split sectors crossing either the 0 or 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
21 
the 360 degree bearing into two sectors; stop the first sector at the 360 degree bearing 
and start the second sector at the 0 degree bearing. Instrument Procedure Specialist will 
ensure the sector end bearings are at least 8 degrees from the start bearings and 
specified in whole degree increments. (T-2). 
3.2.2.6.2.  Using Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.6 as examples, Instrument Procedure 
Specialist will draw arcs (ranges) centered on the ASR antenna to encompass areas 
identified in paragraph 3.2.2.3. On the AADM, record arc ranges to the nearest .25 
nautical miles. On the GTM, record arc ranges to the nearest whole nautical miles. 
Ensure the sector end range is at least 4 nautical miles from the start range and specified 
in no less than .25 nautical miles increments. (T-2). 
3.2.2.6.3.  Up to but no more than 128 sectors may be defined using azimuth and range 
start – end combinations. On complicated charts, it may be necessary to make 
compromises to conserve bearings and ranges from the ASR antenna. The geographic 
boundaries of each altitude-warning sector in the map are defined by two azimuth 
boundaries and range boundaries (range start and range end). The map for a given site 
may include up to 32 different azimuth boundaries and up to 32 different range 
boundaries. Each azimuth boundary value or range boundary value may be used as the 
start or stop azimuth limit for a number of different sectors. Instrument Procedure 
Specialist will take appropriate action to remain within this number, but in no case will 
aircraft operate below the MVA without proper LAAS processing. (T-2). 
3.2.3.  LAAS Associated with Mobile and Selected Fixed RADAR Systems. The following 
information pertains only to LAAS associated with AN/GPN-27, AN/TPN-19, or AN/MPN-
14 RADARs. 
3.2.3.1.  Function. This LAAS feature operates identically to the DBRITE LAAS except 
that only one code can be inhibited. 
3.2.3.2.  Data Submission. Packages include AADM and GTM, and a completed LAAS 
Data Collection Sheet Checklist for Mobile and Selected Fixed RADAR Systems (Table 
3.1). 
3.2.3.3.  Data Collection and Package Development. Instrument Procedure Specialist will 
draw LAAS charts for these systems in the same manner as for DBRITE LAAS except the 
chart design accounts for different bearing and range restrictions based on equipment 
limitations. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will complete LAAS Data Collection Sheet 
Checklist for Mobile and selected Fixed RADAR Systems (Table 3.1) as follows: 
3.2.3.4.1.  SITE NAME: Enter the four-letter ICAO identifier and name for the facility. 
(T-2).

3.2.3.4.5.  SECTOR #: Enter each identified sector in order. Identify the exact order by 
sector number on all maps and drawings submitted with the LAAS package.  Begin 
with 001 and proceed sequentially to the system limit of 128. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.1.  RANGE START. Enter the sector range closest to the antenna to the 
nearest whole nautical mile. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.2.  RANGE STOP. Enter the sector range farthest from the antenna to the 
nearest whole nautical mile. Ensure this range is at least 2 nautical miles greater 
than the sector start range. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.3.  AZIMUTH START. Enter the sector-starting azimuth (also called the 
“left” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree. The start azimuth is the one the Plan 
Position Indicator sweep passes first as it rotates from the ASR magnetic 360 
bearing in a clockwise direction. Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.4.  AZIMUTH STOP. Enter the sector ending azimuth (also called the 
“right” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree. The stop azimuth is the azimuth the 
Plan Position Indicator sweep passes last as it rotates from the ASR magnetic 360 
bearing in a clockwise direction. Ensure this value is at least 4 degrees greater than 
the segment start azimuth.  Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.5.  MINIMUM ALTITUDE: Enter the lowest MSL altitude at which an 
aircraft may operate without activating the LAAS. Enter this data in hundreds of 
feet. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.6.  MODE 3/A LOCKOUT: Enter codes as code blocks (i.e., 1200- 1277), 
or as individual codes. (T-2). 
3.2.3.4.5.7.  TEST CELL TARGET RANGE: Enter the Range Azimuth Beacon 
Monitor target range in nautical miles. Note: For AN/MPN-14K, AN/TPN-19 and 
systems using an Indicator Data Processor (CP-1047/T), the Test Cell Target Range 
must be set at 12 nautical miles. For AN/MPN-14K, the test target CODE switches 
must be set to “6666” on the Video Signal Processor. (T-2).

DIVERSE VECTOR AREA DEVELOPMENT 
4.1.  Diverse Vector Area. 
4.1.1.  When requested by IFR facility management or host nation aviation authorities, the 
Instrument Procedure Specialist will use GPD, FAA Order 8260.3D, Section 14-5, FAA Order 
7210.3AA, paragraph 3-8-5 and the following guidance to develop a DVA. (T-1). Exception: 
When no penetrations to the 40:1 diverse departure assessment exist, Instrument Procedure 
Specialist will notify the requesting ATC facility management that a DVA is not required IAW 
FAA Order 7210.3AA, paragraph 3-8-5. (T-1). When a DVA is requested and required, the 
Instrument Procedure Specialist will document coordination with IFR facility management and 
the Airfield Operation Flight Commander by obtaining their signatures on the GPD 
Approach/Departure Signature Page. (T-2). MAJCOM TERPS review and approval is required 
prior to DVA implementation. (T-2). DVAs do not require flight inspection. Note 1: When the 
USAF provides IFR air traffic services to an airport that the FAA has TERPS responsibilities, 
contact the appropriate FAA instrument procedure designer for a list of the non- Digital Terrain 
Elevation Data penetrations of the diverse departure assessment area for each runway. USAF 
Instrument Procedure Specialist will ensure these results include the location, description, and 
elevation of all 40:1 Obstacle Clearance Surface penetrations. (T-3). The USAF Instrument 
Procedure Specialist will use this information when developing the DVA. (T-3). Note 2:  
When the FAA provides IFR air traffic services to an airport that the USAF has TERPS 
responsibilities, when contacted by the appropriate FAA instrument procedure designer 
provide them with a list of the non-Digital Terrain Elevation Data penetrations of the diverse

TERPS SUPPORT OF USAF NON-RADAR PROGRAMS 
5.1.  General.  Non-RADAR programs at USAF Air Traffic Facilities are the responsibility of the 
IFR Facility Manager. Non-RADAR programs are developed/maintained in concert with the 
supporting Instrument Procedure Specialist.  This Instrument Procedure Specialist may be located 
locally or at the MAJCOM. Note 1: Most instrument procedure specialists are not certified in the 
IFR facilities they support and may have no practical experience working in a non-RADAR 
environment. However, they do have the ability to plot NAVAIDs, holding patterns, radials, 
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) points, fixes, transfer of control points, airspace 
boundaries, arcs about NAVAIDs, and airspace to be protected, etc., as requested by facility 
management. Note 2: See Figure 5.1 for an example of a non-RADAR drawing and AFMAN 
(formerly AFI) 13-204 Volume 3 for non-RADAR board content. 
5.2.  IFR Facility Manager.  During the non-RADAR program development, the IFR facility 
manager shall contact the Instrument Procedure Specialist and request support. (T-3). 
5.3.  IFR Facility Manager will supply the following as applicable: 
5.3.1.  Depiction of any current non-RADAR board. (T-3). 
5.3.2.  Current non-RADAR program details. (T-3). 
5.3.3.  List of requested holding fixes, to include minimum and maximum holding altitudes. 
(T-3). 
5.3.4.  List of departure routings (NAVAID radials) and or Standard Instrument Departures 
(SIDs) for each runway, to include altitudes and associated transfer of control points. (T-3).

MANUAL TERPS CALCULATIONS 
6.1.  ILS Application.  Instrument Procedure Specialist will calculate ground point of intercept, 
runway point of intercept, and Threshold Crossing Height (TCH) for ILS procedures IAW FAA 
Order 8260.3D. See Figure 6.1, Figure 6.2, and Figure 6.3 for sample calculations. (T-1).

6.1.1.  For a new, existing, or a relocated glide slope, enter the appropriate elevation (either 
site or crown elevation), as applicable, used during commissioning flight inspection of the ILS 
Glide Slope on the ILS properties page in GPD. Also enter this value in Block 40 of FAA Form 
7900-6, Instrument Landing System (ILS) Data. 
6.2.  GPN 22/25 and TPN-19 Precision Approach RADAR (scanning RADAR) 
Systems.  Computing the runway point of intercept is not necessary. The runway point of intercept 
is determined during system installation and should be coincident with the ILS runway point of 
intercept (where an ILS is installed). When no other precision landing aid is installed, the 
instrument procedure specialist determines the runway point of intercept to achieve the desired 
TCH consistent with mission aircraft. (T-2). The “Touchdown (Kft)” value on the site parameter 
panel represents the distance from the runway point of intercept to the point abeam the precision 
approach radar (PAR) antenna, not the distance from the runway point of intercept to the threshold. 
In order to use the correct value for coincidence issues or FAA Form 7900-6 input, Instrument 
Procedure Specialist will ensure the runway point of intercept value used is from the threshold. 
(T-2). 
6.3.  FPN-62 and MPN-14K Precision Approach RADAR (tracking RADAR) Systems.  The 
ground point of intercept (touchdown) is a calculated point on the runway centerline using the 
requested glide slope and TCH for the procedure. The touchdown reflector is located at a point on 
an arc, abeam the runway centerline between the PAR antenna and the threshold where the arc 
centered on the PAR antenna is swung at a distance equal to the distance from the PAR antenna to 
the ground point of intercept (Figure 6.4). The runway point of intercept is determined during 
system installation and should be coincident with the ILS runway point of intercept (where an ILS 
is installed). When no other precision landing aid is installed, the instrument procedure specialist 
determines the runway point of intercept needed to achieve the desired TCH consistent with 
mission aircraft. (T-2).

Threshold. 
 
6.4.  Determining Points on Maps and Charts.  Since maps do not always accurately depict the 
airport reference point, NAVAIDs, fixes, or the locations of some man-made obstacles, the 
instrument procedure specialist requires the ability to manually plot geodetic coordinates or 
determine the coordinates of a point depicted on a map. When using an engineer’s scale to measure 
distances, the scale affording the greatest accuracy should be used throughout the operation. 
6.4.1.  Plotting Known Geographical Coordinates. Instead of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, 
coordinates are sometimes recorded as Degrees/Decimal minutes. Note: Paragraph 6.7.3. and 
paragraph 6.7.4. provide example conversion calculations. Example:  Plot the airport reference 
point coordinates at Myrtle Beach International Airport (N 33° 40' 47.10" W 078° 55' 42.00"): 
6.4.1.1.  Step 1. Locate the latitude and longitude (Lat/Lon) grid rectangle that contains the 
coordinates to be plotted. Figure 6.5. depicts a 1:250,000 Joint Operations Graphic (JOG). 
Example: The MYR airport reference point coordinates are located within the rectangle N 
33° 30' 00" W 078° 45' 00" (lower right corner) to N 33° 45' 00" W 079° 00' 00" (upper 
left corner). 
6.4.1.2.  Step 2. Using an engineer’s scale and a calculator, determine the number of 
seconds of latitude and longitude represented by each “tick” on the engineer’s scale 
reference the map being used to plot the coordinates. 
6.4.1.2.1.  Latitude example. 
 
 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
37 
6.4.1.2.1.1.  Measure the distance between two latitudes that make the top and 
bottom sides of the rectangle determined in Step 1 with the 60 scale on an 
engineer’s scale. Our example uses N 33° 30' 00" and N 33° 45' 00". This distance 
should measure approximately 261 “ticks” using the 60 scale between these lines 
of latitude. 
6.4.1.2.1.2.  The difference between N 33° 30' 00" and N 33° 45' 00" is 15'. Convert 
15' to seconds by multiplying by 60 (15' × 60 = 900"). 
6.4.1.2.1.3.  Divide 900" by 261 “ticks” to determine the number of seconds of 
latitude per “tick”. 900 ÷ 261 = 3.44828 seconds of latitude per “tick”. 
6.4.1.2.2.  Longitude example. 
6.4.1.2.2.1.  Measure the distance between two longitudes that make the right and 
left sides of the rectangle determined in Step 1 with the 60 scale on an engineer’s 
scale. Our example uses N 78° 45' 00" and N 79° 00' 00". This should measure 
approximately 218 “ticks” using the 60 scale between these lines of longitude. 
6.4.1.2.2.2.  The difference between N 78° 45' 00" and N 79° 00' 00" is 15'. Convert 
15' to seconds by multiplying by 60 (15' × 60 = 900"). 
6.4.1.2.2.3.  Divide 900" by 218 “ticks” to determine the number of seconds of 
longitude per “tick.” 900 ÷ 218 = 4.12844 seconds of longitude per “tick”. 
6.4.1.3.  Step 3. Figure 6.6. Identify a longitude on the Lat/Lon grid close to the longitude 
of the target coordinate. Along this same longitude line, identify the working latitude close 
to the latitude of the target coordinate. Add or subtract this latitude value from the target 
latitude as appropriate. It is generally easier to select the working latitude that is less than 
the target latitude, but either way is acceptable. 
6.4.1.3.1.  Example 1. Working latitude selected is N 33° 40' 00.00". Determine the 
sum of the difference between the target latitude N 33° 40' 47.10" and the working 
latitude to determine the number of seconds difference.

latitude to determine the number of seconds difference.

6.4.1.4.  Step 4. Determine the number of engineer scale “ticks” for the sum determined in 
Step 3. Then measure this distance from the working latitude and mark with a working line 
perpendicular to the target longitude. 
6.4.1.4.1.  Example 1. 47.10" ÷ 3.44828 = 13.659 (or 14 rounded) “ticks” north of N 
33° 40' 00". 
6.4.1.4.2.  Example 2. 12.90" ÷ 3.44828 = 3.741 (or 4 rounded) “ticks” south of N 33° 
41' 00".

6.4.1.5.  Step 5. Figure 6.6. Add or subtract the working longitude value from the target 
longitude, as appropriate, in the same manner for longitude in Step 3. It is generally easier 
to select a working longitude that is less than the target longitude, but either way is 
acceptable. 
6.4.1.5.1.  Example 1. Working longitude selected is W 78° 55' 00.00". Determine the 
sum of the difference between the target longitude W 78° 55' 42.00" and the working 
longitude to determine the number of seconds difference.

6.4.1.5.2.  Example 2. Working longitude selected in W 78° 56' 00.00". Determine the 
sum of the difference between the target longitude W 78° 55' 42.00" and the working 
longitude to determine the number of seconds difference. 
 78º 56’ 00.00” 
- 78º 55’ 42.00” 
  
  18.00” 
6.4.1.6.  Step 6. Determine the number of engineer scale “ticks” for the sum determined in 
Step 5. 
6.4.1.6.1.  Example 1. 42.00" ÷ 4.12844 = 10.173 (or 10 rounded) “ticks” west of N 
78° 55' 00". 
6.4.1.6.2.  Example 2. 18.00" ÷ 4.12844 = 4.360 (or 4 rounded) “ticks” east of N 78° 
56' 00". 
6.4.1.7.  Step 7. Measure this distance from the target longitude and mark with a working 
line perpendicular to the latitude grid. Mark the intersection of the two working lines. This 
is the location of the target coordinates (airport reference point). 
6.4.2.  Determining Unknown Geographical Coordinates. The process for determining a set of 
coordinates for an object or point depicted on a map is the reverse of those steps for plotting 
known coordinates. Take Steps 1 and 2 as outlined in paragraph 6.4.1. Next draw two working 
lines through the point, first perpendicular to longitude, then perpendicular to latitude, making 
sure the lines are long enough to intersect the Lat/Lon grid. Determine the working latitude 
and longitude by finding the nearest hash mark from the points where the working lines 
intersect the Lat/Lon grid. Using an engineer’s scale, measure the number of “ticks” between 
the working lines and the working latitude or longitude. Divide the number of “ticks” by the 
seconds per “tick” values to determine the number of seconds the point is from the working 
latitude or longitude. Add or subtract as necessary the seconds from the working coordinates 
to determine the latitude and longitude. 
6.5.  Application of Magnetic Variation Conversions.  Apply conversions of magnetic azimuth 
to true azimuth and vice versa utilizing table 6.1. and table 6.2. 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019

Table 6.1.  East Variation Conversion 
 
Note: East variation indicates that magnetic North is East of True North. To convert true azimuth 
to magnetic azimuth or magnetic azimuth to true azimuth with East variation, apply the 
applicable formula from Table 6.1. When the result is greater than 360°, subtract 360° to convert 
the result to a positive value between 0° and 360°. 
Table 6.2.  West Variation Conversion 
 
Note: West variation indicates that magnetic North is West of True North. To convert true 
azimuth to magnetic azimuth or magnetic azimuth to true azimuth with West variation, apply the 
applicable formula from Table 6.2. When the result is greater than 360°, subtract 360° to convert 
the result to a positive value between 0° and 360°. 
6.6.  True Bearing Conversions.   True bearings shown on some engineering maps are depicted 
as values between 000 and 090, by quadrant. Convert these bearings to true azimuth (relative to 
true north) for TERPS application. Reference Figure 6.7, convert true bearing to true azimuth as 
follows:

6.7.  Miscellaneous Formulas. 
6.7.1.  Final approach fix to missed approach point calculation: Distance (in nautical miles) × 
60 ÷ Speed in knots = Time in decimal minutes (that is, 3.5 = 3 minutes, 30 seconds) 
6.7.2.  Rate of Descent: feet per minute = Ground Speed in Knots × (G/S angle) × 101.2685914 
÷ 57.29577951. 
6.7.3.  Coordinates in Degree/Decimal minutes to Degree/Minutes/Seconds: Decimal portion 
of Minutes × 60 = Seconds. 
Example:  N 32º 25.69’ 
.69’ X 60 = 41.4” 
N 32º 25.69’ = N32º 25’ 41.40” 
AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
43 
6.7.4.  Coordinates in Degree/Minutes/Seconds to Degree/Decimal Minutes: Seconds ÷ 60 = 
Minutes after the decimal; then add the minutes. 
Example:  N 78º 13’ 43.20” 
(43.20” ÷ 60 = .72’) plus 13’ = 13.72” 
N 78º 13’ 43.20” = N 78º 13.72’ 
6.7.5.  To find the length or angle of an arc: 
Length = angle X radius ÷57.3 
Angle = 57.3 X length ÷ radius 
6.7.6.  The following formula may be used when it becomes necessary to calculate the straight-
line distance between two points on an arc (the Chord) (Figure 6.8): 
Chord (C) = 2 R sin (a) ÷ 2 
Where:  Angle (a) = Number of degrees between radials 
 
  Radius (R) = Distance (DME Value) of the Arc

6.10.  Convert and round host nation MSL metric values to a value expressed in feet MSL 
prior to publication in the DoD FLIP (Terminal).  Apply conversion values from Table 6.3. Do 
not directly convert metric query field elevation (QFE) values to an equivalent MSL value and 
then round that value prior to publishing in the DoD FLIP (Terminal). When required, derive the 
equivalent MSL foot value of the host QFE value as follows: 
6.10.1.  Example 1: The reference datum is the field elevation of 34 feet (threshold elevation 
30 feet). Host publishes a QFE value of 750 meters at the stepdown fix. Do not simply divide 
750 meters by 0.3047999 (750 ÷ 0.3047999 = 2460.630728) and publish 2461 in parentheses. 
First add the reference datum elevation to the converted value (34 + 2461 = 2495) to determine 
the equivalent MSL value. Next, round that result (2495) up to the next 10-foot increment 
(2500). Next, subtract out the reference datum elevation from the rounded value (2500 – 34 = 
2466). Publish 2500 (US QNH) over 2466 (US QFE value) in parentheses at the stepdown fix 
on the DoD procedure.

AFMAN13-215V2  29 AUGUST 2019 
6.10.2.  Example 2:  The reference datum is the threshold elevation of 616 feet (field elevation 
625). Host publishes a QFE value of 750 meters at the final approach fix. Do not simply 
multiply 750 meters by 3.2808399 (750 × 3.2808399 = 2460.629925) and publish 2461 in 
parentheses. First add the reference datum elevation to the converted value (616 + 2461 = 
3077) to determine the equivalent MSL value. Next, round that result (3077) up to the next 10-
foot increment (3080) IAW paragraph 13.6.4.1.3. Next, subtract out the reference datum 
elevation from the rounded value (3080 – 616 = 2464). Publish 3080 (US QNH) over 2464 
(US QFE value) in parentheses at the final approach fix on the DoD procedure.
