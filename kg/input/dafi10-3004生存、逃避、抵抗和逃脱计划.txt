Chapter 1 
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE SURVIVAL, EVASION, RESISTANCE, 
AND ESCAPE (SERE) PROGRAM 
1.1.  General.  This instruction: 
1.1.1.  Defines minimum levels of initial SERE training and SERE Mission Preparation (SMP) 
requirements for DAF personnel. 
1.1.2.  Identifies Personnel Recovery Operational Support (PROS) Program Manager (PM) 
responsibilities and defines roles and duties of PROS program management. 
1.1.3.  Defines procedures for standardization and evaluation of the SERE Program. 
1.1.4.  Identifies Isolated Personnel Survivability (IPS) program requirements for DAF 
personnel. 
1.2.  Program Overview.  The DAF SERE Program is a function within the Department of 
Defense (DoD) PR enterprise. The DAF SERE Program encompasses initial SERE Training, SMP, 
and PROS required to enable military, civilian, contractor, and other designated personnel to return 
to friendly control after an isolating event due to enemy actions, aircraft emergency, or other 
unforeseen events. The DAF SERE Program supports PR through education, formal training, 
preparation events, and operations support activities. Specifically, the Universal Joint Task List, 
Air Force Universal Task List, Joint Mission Essential Task List, and applicable Air Force (AF) 
tasks for conducting PR operations drive SERE Program requirements. Doctrinally, the PR system 
is comprised of education and training, mission planning, execution, tracking, debriefing, 
reintegration, and applying applicable lessons learned. The SERE Program begins and closes the 
PR continuum beginning with initial SERE training and culminating with reintegration and 
adaptation. 
1.2.1.  The SERE Program provides PR preparation, planning, execution, and adaptation to 
combatant commanders across the full spectrum of operations by applying SERE tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTP) to enable Isolated Personnel (IP) to survive and return with 
honor. 
1.2.2.  Preparation tasks include initial SERE Training, SMP, and continuation training. Initial 
SERE Training, SMP, and continuation training provide an efficient and effective PR/SERE 
preparation continuum throughout the member's career. Note: The Code of Conduct (CoC) is 
the foundation for the warfighter’s PR/SERE preparation and training. DAF SERE programs 
must prepare DAF personnel for isolation across the competition continuum. 
1.2.3.  The DAF SERE Program must provide the necessary PR support to DAF personnel at 
risk of isolation and/or capture prior to and during operations. IP increase their chance of an 
expedient recovery and reduce risk to the recovery force when they are trained, prepared, and 
equipped to perform PR/SERE TTP. 
1.2.4.  PR and SERE programs enable the collection of critical information during exercises, 
rehearsals, PR missions, and reintegration or contingency SERE debriefs. These documented 
lessons learned drive adaptation to an ever-changing PR and SERE environment.

DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
1.3.  Waivers. 
1.3.1.  Initial SERE Training. AF/A3S is the waiver authority for formal SERE training courses 
listed in Attachment 2. Deploying personnel with an Evasion and Conduct After Capture 
requirements identified by Combatant Commands (CCMDs) must refer to AFI 10-405, Ready 
Airman Training, for waiver procedures. Note: DAF personnel may only attend sister service 
SERE Level-C courses with AF/A3S approval. This ensures the DAF captures validated SERE 
requirements, identifies DAF training gaps, and prevents personnel from attending courses 
which do not meet the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Directives or DAF 
requirements. 
1.3.2.  Specialized SERE Course SERE 220 (formerly SV83A). AF/A3S liaises with affected 
MAJCOM and Headquarters (HQ) United States Air Force (USAF) Mission Design Series 
(MDS) Functional Area Managers, then serves as the USAF OPR to coordinate requests for 
waivers to course SERE 220 training through the AF/A3. Due to unique requirements, program 
waivers may require additional coordination through AF/A2, Air Combat Command (ACC), 
Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), and Air Force Special Operations Command 
(AFSOC). When applicable, units must specify a request for Joint Personnel Recovery Agency 
(JPRA) SERE 201, Senior Leader Seminar, incorporating SERE 220 materials within the 
waiver request. (T-0) 
1.3.3.  MAJCOM Operations Division (MAJCOM/A3) is the waiver authority for the SMP 
program. (T-2) Approved waivers remain in effect for the minimum amount of time needed to 
correct the problem but will not exceed 1-year. The approving official may cancel a waiver in 
writing if issues change the basic intent/requirement for the waiver. (T-2) 
1.3.4.  Sister-Service Waivers. Waivers are not automatic for USAF SERE courses. The unit 
will forward waiver requests to MAJCOM SERE PM to determine training gaps and additional 
training requirements. (T-1) See paragraph 3.3 to determine which sister-service courses are 
acceptable for waiver consideration.

FORMAL SURVIVAL EVASION, RESISTANCE, AND ESCAPE (SERE) TRAINING 
3.1.  SERE Training Programs. 
3.1.1.  USAF Level-A SERE Training program. Level-A is the minimum SERE training event 
for all deploying DAF personnel. SERE 100 is no longer authorized and has been replaced by 
the SERE 100.2 computer-based training. SERE 100.2 is a Joint Personnel Recovery Agency 
developed course which meets Level-A within the CJCSM 3500.09C, Joint Standards for 
SERE Education and Training in support of the Code of Conduct and Principles of Behavior. 
Other forms of Level-A delivery must be approved by AF/A3S. 
3.1.1.1.  Computer Based Training is an individual requirement and is the only venue to 
meet SERE 100.2 requirements unless approved by AF/A3S. 
3.1.1.2.  Certified personnel who conduct SS03 events exceed Level-A/SERE 100.2 
training requirements. Unit Training Managers utilize DAF Form 797, Job Qualification 
Standard Continuation/Command JQS and DAF Form 1098, Special Task Certification 
and Recurring Training, to update Joint Knowledge Online and to create a SERE 100.2 
certificate. 
3.1.2.  USAF Level-B and Level-C SERE Training Programs. The terminal learning objectives 
within the CJCSM 3500.09C are the minimum training objectives. (T-0) 
3.1.2.1.  Additional DAF unique SERE training content requirements are dictated by both 
the Air Components of the CCMDs and the MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs and then formalized 
by memorandum from AF/A3 to Air Education and Training Command, Operations 
(AETC/A3) for DAF SERE training objectives. 
3.1.2.2.  Personnel who have completed Level-C and Advanced Level-B SERE training 
require SS02 Combat Survival Preparation and/or SS03 Conduct after Capture to maintain 
combat mission ready status as identified in Table 4.2. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) 
personnel current on SS02 and/or SS03 exceeds Level-A/SERE 100.2 training 
requirements only if they maintain SS02 and/or SS03 currency within the DoD Directive 
(DoDD) 3002.01, Personnel Recovery in the Department of Defense, Level-A 36-month 
currency requirement. Unit Training Managers utilize ARMS SS02 and/or SS03 date-last-
complete to update Joint Knowledge Online and to create a SERE 100.2 certificate. 
3.2.  SERE Training Course Attendance. 
3.2.1.  Any personnel identified by the combatant commanders and AF/A3 will attend SERE 
training. (T-0) 
3.2.2.  Table 3.1  identifies SERE training courses and attendance priority. Unless specifically 
directed, personnel attend SERE courses only once. (T-1) 
3.2.2.1.  Any unfilled training quotas not sub-allocated 30 days prior to class start date may 
be utilized by any authorized attendee. Authorized attendees will request unused 
allocations through their Unit Training Manager who will coordinate with the MAJCOM 
formal training manager. (T-2) 
16 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
3.2.2.2.  Any mandatory student who requires SERE training takes priority over any 
student who is not required but authorized attendance. 
3.2.3.  AF/A3S may reprioritize personnel in response to real-world contingencies and/or 
constraints. 
3.2.4.  AETC has the authority to replace any lower priority student with a higher priority 
student for AETC’s SERE training courses. All changes will be coordinated with the affected 
SERE PM prior to implementation. (T-2) 
3.2.5.  Attendance by personnel outside listed priorities, requires approval from the MAJCOM 
SERE PM and coordination with the AETC SERE PM. 
3.2.6.  SERE 245 attendance requirements are outlined in Attachment 9.

Chapter 5 
SERE PROGRAM, PERSONNEL RECOVERY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT (PROS) 
NOTE: CHAPTER 5 ONLY APPLIES TO COMBAT-CODED WINGS. 
5.1.  General Concepts of PROS. 
5.1.1.  This chapter provides the framework for the DAF PROS programs conducted by the 
MAJCOMs. This framework prescribes policies and procedures for MAJCOMs to adapt into 
specific guidance for their subordinate mission area(s)/Wings. It implements specified and 
implied PR-specific tasks for the Wings and provides overall DAF PROS program intent. 
5.1.2.  The DAF PROS program supports PR requirements reflected in CJCSI 3270.01C, 
DoDD 3002.01, and JP 3-50. Note: PR Operational Support was formerly known as Evasion 
and Recovery or Escape and Evasion and includes duties related to conventional and Non-
conventional Assisted Recovery in accordance with DoDI 3002.04, DoD Personnel Recovery 
- Non-conventional Assisted Recovery (NAR). 
5.1.3.  PROS programs consist of all actions taken at the tactical, operational, and strategic 
level prior to mission execution to organize, train, and equip (prepare) command staffs, forces, 
and personnel on PR and SERE TTP in the event of isolation. 
5.1.3.1.  Advising on actions taken pre-mission, before and after isolation to plan and 
execute PR (planning and execution), actions taken after recovery, and ensuring lessons 
learned are documented and incorporated into TTP (adaptation). 
5.1.3.2.  Unit-level PROS Programs are executed and supported by unit commander 
designated personnel. 
5.1.3.3.  PROS programs will provide PR/SERE mission preparation and management of 
PR products, equipment, aids, and systems to include EPA, EAP, PRMS, ISOPREP, PRK, 
blood chits, EVC, and pre-mission PR/SERE briefings and Personnel Recovery Mission 
Management integration. (T-2) 
5.1.4.  At a minimum, PROS program POCs will be established for each wing, although 
commanders may elect to do so at lower echelons as well. PROS POCs will develop and 
maintain a unit PROS program that follows wing and MAJCOM guidance. (T-2) 
5.2.  Personnel Recovery Preparation.  Preparation comprises most of the unit level PROS 
program and includes but is not limited to policies and procedures, initial and pre-mission training, 
and equipping within the requirements of the unit and their assigned mission. 
5.2.1.  Policies and procedures will be established at the unit level in accordance with 
MAJCOM guidance, unit mission requirements, and unit specific capabilities. All policies and 
procedures regarding PR will be maintained in the unit PR SOP as required by paragraphs 2.7, 
2.8, and 2.9 of this DAFI. 
5.2.2.  Initial and pre-mission training will be scheduled, tracked, recorded, and conducted in 
accordance with Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of this DAFI. 
 
 
34 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
5.2.3.  PR equipment encompasses all equipment for training as well as employment during 
execution of mission requirements. Preparation equipment will be MDS specific for the unit. 
Personnel need to be fully capable of employing all operational equipment in a survival and 
evasion scenario. Coordination with AFE will be made to obtain decommissioned operational 
equipment that is still functional for training use whenever possible. Equipment that is not 
available as decommissioned operational equipment will be identified and coordinated with 
AFE and budgeted accordingly. (T-3) 
5.2.4.  PRKs provide select at-risk (moderate or high) personnel with essential equipment, 
tools, and items necessary for successful survival, evasion, resistance, and escape in a specific 
non-permissive environment/situation. They are designed to supplement/augment DAF issued 
survival kits, which are of a global nature or act as an in-lieu of kit for AFSCs not provided 
with DAF kits. All items should support CCMD PR plans and theater PR capabilities. PRKs 
should be issued from home station and tailored to specific unit/individual missions when 
possible. 
5.2.4.1.  Unit personnel that employ PRKs should employ them during local SMP and PR 
exercises to maintain familiarity with items. They must possess a thorough understanding 
of effective TTP for item employment under isolation conditions. (T-3) 
5.2.4.2.  Include PRK items as part of the individuals EPA/EAP. In the event of a recovery 
effort, PRK information for isolated personnel must be quickly passed to servicing 
recovery centers. (T-3) 
5.2.4.2.1.  The specific size and placement of the PRK on personnel will be closely 
scrutinized and tailored to the mission, platform, or egress procedures (air or ground), 
as needed. If worn/placed on personnel equipped with ejection seats or bailout 
parachutes, ensure the PRK does not impose a windblast hazard. Contact the local 
Safety Office and AFE Officer or Superintendent for safety of flight inquires. All non-
approved kits/items must be approved by the MAJCOM PROS OPR. (T-3) 
5.2.4.2.2.  Coordinate unit PRK requirements through the chain of command to 
respective MAJCOM PROS OPRs prior to acquisition/funds allocations. Reference 
MAJCOM supplements to this DAFI for additional guidance. 
5.2.4.3.  Other evasion aids should be available for training and operational use. Specific 
evasion aids should be determined during the PR Planning process. Specific items are 
managed and issued by the specific PM. These items include, but are not limited to: 
5.2.4.3.1.  EVC. 
5.2.4.3.2.  Pointee-Talkies. 
5.2.4.3.3.  Picto-grams. 
5.2.4.3.4.  Specialized signaling and communication devices. 
5.2.4.3.5.  Blood chits. 
5.2.4.3.6.  ISOPREPs. 
5.2.4.3.7.  EPAs/EAPs. 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
35 
5.2.4.4.  PR Exercises will be conducted at least biannually and can be unit specific or 
conducted as part of a larger theater exercises. They should be designed to meet the unique 
requirements of each unit and capable of being integrated into the larger PR architecture. 
After action reviews and lessons learned will be documented for PROS program inclusion. 
(T-3) 
5.3.  Personnel Recovery Planning.  PR planning is designed to identify mission-specific 
vulnerabilities and mitigation measures for unit operations including coordination throughout the 
PR architecture. The PROS PM should integrate into operational unit’s mission planning cell 
activities in accordance with Attachments 15 and 23 of AFTTP 3-3 IPE, Integrated Planning and 
Employment, to advocate for the IP planning considerations for all operations where personnel are 
placed at an increased risk of isolation. Planning for isolation builds upon the foundation of 
PR/SERE mission analysis by focusing with greater detail on specific area of operations. It is 
designed to assess effects of threat domains on isolated personnel that are not routinely considered 
in flight planning. Additionally, during operations the PROS PM will provide planners situational 
awareness on the status of IPs within the battlespace and potential dynamic opportunities to 
support them (i.e., signal detection, location identification, authentication, etc.). 
5.3.1.  The PROS PM is the lead for integrating the unit into the larger PR architecture within 
their operational area in accordance with GCC, MAJCOM, and higher headquarters’ guidance. 
The PROS PM should establish lines of communication within operational planning teams to 
ensure thorough consideration for all PR/isolation scenarios deemed probable. PR planning 
will take environmental considerations, both natural and man-made into consideration when 
identifying necessary equipment supplementation and possible PR gaps. 
5.3.2.  The PROS PM should collaborate with the following, at a minimum: Weapons and 
Tactics; Current Operations, Intelligence, AFE; and Theater PR nodes. 
5.4.  Personnel Recovery Execution.  Unit level execution will vary based upon the type of unit 
and mission capabilities. Air centric units may be more dependent on outside support for successful 
recovery mission operations, whereas ground centric units may have a response element capable 
of providing self-recovery for isolated personnel. Unit specific execution tasks should be included 
in the unit PR SOP in accordance with this DAFI. Minimum considerations should include: 
5.4.1.  Communication integration. 
5.4.2.  Incident reporting. 
5.4.3.  Authentication. 
5.4.4.  Organic capabilities. 
5.4.5.  Support capabilities. 
5.5.  Personnel Recovery Adaptation.  Adaptation involves the documentation and reporting of 
identified strengths and weaknesses across the unit’s entire PROS program. After action reports 
and lessons learned will be forwarded to the MAJCOM PROS OPR as soon as they are completed 
to be integrated across the force. (T-3)

Chapter 6 
SERE PROGRAM STANDARDIZATION AND EVALUATION 
6.1.  SERE Program Inspection.  MAJCOMs will establish comprehensive certification, 
standardization, and evaluation programs to ensure compliance with DAFI 90-302, this DAFI, and 
applicable MAJCOM instructions. (T-2) 
6.2.  Air Force SERE Program Compliance.  MAJCOMs will conduct inspections and assess 
AF SERE program compliance in three areas: Initial SERE Training, SMP, and PR Operational 
Support programs. (T-1)  
6.3.  Personnel Recovery (PR) Exercises.  A robust PR exercise program is imperative for 
preparing the warfighter for prosecution of recovery across the spectrum of engagement. A major 
part of training for the PR process is the specific "actions on the objective" or the IP's role in the 
overall recovery effort. Operational wings are encouraged to conduct a PR exercise at least once 
every fiscal year. 
6.4.  Personnel Recovery (PR) Readiness Inspections.  PR Readiness Inspections will be used 
to validate SERE and PR related Mission Essential Tasks against the threat level supported units 
report capability against. The wing commander, with PROS PM input, determines overall scope 
and scale of these inspections as well as the measures of performance to evaluate. (T-3) 
6.4.1.  The SERE Program may be assessed via operationally relevant SMP events, IP task 
evaluations, micro-exercises, and larger installation exercises. 
6.4.2.  PR support activities should evaluate actions taken to prepare at-risk personnel, develop 
evasion plans of action, support recovery execution, and conduct reintegration debriefs to adapt 
recovery planning to the variables of the conflict. 
6.5.  Post Training Exercises (PTEs). 
6.5.1.  MAJCOMs may conduct PTEs to evaluate CAC program effectiveness. PTE 
participants must be Advanced Level-B or C graduates. (T-2) 
6.5.2.  MAJCOM requests for JPRA supported PTEs will be coordinated through AF/A3S. 
Once JPRA support is approved, requesting unit will coordinate directly with JPRA keeping 
MAJCOM and HAF POCs informed until PTE is complete. (T-1) 
6.5.3.  MAJCOM requests to conduct independent PTEs will be coordinated with AF/A3S and 
approved by the MAJCOM/A3. Requests must include the following items: justification for 
training, type of training, desired learning outcome, length of training, instructor qualifications, 
risk management, and support requirements. (T-2) 
6.5.4.  Requesting unit will forward lessons-learned/after-action reports to the assessed unit 
commander and AF/A3S. (T-1) AF/A3S will forward lessons-learned/after-action to JPRA and 
courtesy copy appropriate MAJCOM. (T-1) 
 
 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
37 
 
6.5.5.  PTEs involving two or more services or components must be approved separately by 
the PR OPR for each service or component involved. The requesting unit, if AF, will ensure 
the supporting service or component PR OPRs are included in the staffing process to ensure 
all parties are informed and sufficient coordination is completed. (T-1)

Evasion Plan of Action (EPA)—A course of action, developed before executing a combat 
mission, which is intended to improve a potential evader's chances of successful evasion and 
recovery by providing recovery forces with an additional source of information that can increase 
the predictability of the evader's actions and movement. 
Full Spectrum Captivity—A term used to capture all forms of captivity including Wartime, 
Peacetime Governmental, and Hostage Detention. Full Spectrum Captivity was adopted by the 
AF, by direction of the JPRA, in January 2007. 
Hostage Survival Training—A form of Code of Conduct training that prepares military personnel 
to meet their obligations while being held hostage by terrorists. DoDI O-3002.05 is the basis for 
this training. 
Isolated Event—An incident where United States military, Department of Defense civilians, or 
Department of Defense contractor personnel authorized to accompany the Armed Forces of the 
United States (or others designated by the President or Secretary of Defense) become separated 
from their unit (as an individual or a group) while participating in a United States-sponsored 
activity or mission and are in a situation where they must survive, evade, resist, or escape. 
Isolated Personnel (IP)—United States military, Department of Defense civilians, and 
Department of Defense contractor personnel authorized to accompany the Armed Forces of the 
United States (and others designated by the President or Secretary of Defense) who are separated 
from their unit (as an individual or a group) while participating in a United States-sponsored 
military activity or mission and are, or may be, in a situation where they must survive, evade, 
resist, or escape. A sponsored military activity includes leave status for military and civilians. 
Peacetime—A time when there is an absence of armed conflict in the country or region within 
which an isolated person is situated. 
Peacetime Detention Training—A form of Code of Conduct training that prepares military 
personnel to meet their obligations as detainees of a foreign government. DoDI O-3002.05 is the 
basis for this training. 
SERE Training—A form of Code of Conduct training that prepares military personnel to survive, 
evade, resist, and escape isolation and meet their obligations when they are involuntarily separated 
from friendly forces during combat or as a captive. DoD Instruction O- 3002.05 is the basis for 
this training. Levels of SERE Training are: 
a. Level-A—The minimum level of understanding for all members of the Armed Forces attained 
by all personnel during entry-level training. 
b. Initial Level-B—The minimum level of education and training for members whose duties, 
specialties, missions, or assignments may expose them to medium-risk areas of exploitation, and 
their risk of isolation is highly unlikely.  
 
 
44 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
c. Advanced Level-B—The minimum level of education and training for personnel whose 
duties, specialties, missions, or assignments may expose them to high-risk areas of exploitation 
by a captor during peacetime or combat, but their risk of isolation and a subsequent survival 
situation is moderate. 
d. Level-C—The minimum level of education and training for personnel whose duties, 
specialties, missions, or assignments may expose them to high-risk areas, or are vulnerable to 
greater-than-average exploitation by a captor during peacetime or combat, and whose risk of 
isolation is significant.

RISK MANAGEMENT (RM) 
A5.1.  The SERE mission requirements often place personnel in remote environments and 
potentially hazardous situations.  Conditions often include austere operating locations, 
inclement weather, rugged terrain, hazardous life forms, and fixed/rotary-wing operations. While 
operations within the SERE mission area are objective driven, it is imperative all SERE missions 
begin with a thorough risk assessment in accordance with the five step risk management processes 
outlined in AFI 90-802 and Department of the Air Force Pamphlet 90-803, Risk Management (RM) 
Guidelines and Tools. While it is hard to identify all potential contingencies during an operation, 
proper planning will enhance overall individual safety during high-risk training. Risk management 
must assess the risk, weigh associated factors, and posture for as many contingencies as possible 
within a given operation. Ensure command involvement in the decision-making process. 
Regardless of the mission, risk management must include bioenvironmental, equipment, 
communication, location, and medical considerations. (T-3) 
A5.1.1.  Specifically, SERE operations and training activities will include all AFI 90-802 
requirements plus: (T-3) 
A5.1.1.1.  Bioenvironmental. 
A5.1.1.1.1.  Weather. 
A5.1.1.1.2.  Terrain. 
A5.1.1.1.3.  Animal life. 
A5.1.1.1.4.  Plant life. 
A5.1.1.1.5.  Socio-political. 
A5.1.1.2.  Equipment. 
A5.1.1.2.1.  Vehicles. 
A5.1.1.2.2.  Personal protective. 
A5.1.1.3.  Communications. 
A5.1.1.3.1.  Mobile radios. 
A5.1.1.3.2.  Telephones. 
A5.1.1.3.3.  Air to ground visual signals.

A5.1.1.7.3.  Evacuation plans. 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
51 
A5.1.1.7.4.  Location, directions, and contact procedures for emergency care facilities. 
A5.1.2.  The SERE Program approach to RM should consider “what exists, what is the impact, 
and what is the plan” for each factor. Incorporating these considerations into RM programs 
will ensure overall standardization, reduce instability within the planning processes, and ensure 
SERE operations are conducted in a safe manner, regardless of the operating environment. 
A5.1.3.  The following RM checklists/matrixes may be applied to SERE operations and 
training activities to assist in the safe prosecution of the SERE mission. However, it must be 
understood that mere "numbers" should never be a substitute for sound judgment and decision- 
making. The more complex and hazardous the operation, the more detailed the mission 
planning must be. Units will develop matrixes specifically tailored to their individual 
operational requirements. 
A5.1.4.  Water survival training operations, particularly when conducted in “open water” or 
when utilizing compressed air, pose a variety of unique risks that must be accounted for. 
MAJCOMs will ensure units develop detailed operating instructions/plans of instruction to 
ensure overall objective accomplishment and RM. Procedures must include location of 
decompression chambers and chamber access procedures for units conducting 
HEED/compressed air training. The following outlines specific SERE Specialist/support 
element requirements when conducting water survival training operations: (T-2) 
A5.1.4.1.  Certified Lifeguard or Pararescue or Navy/Coast Guard rescue swimmer on site 
for entire iteration of that session of WSP, but they cannot be there as an attendee at the 
same time. (T-2) 
A5.1.4.2.  Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation qualified personnel on site for duration of entire 
iteration of that session of WSP. (T-2) 
A5.1.4.3.  Units are encouraged to conduct training operations in an open water 
environment. Additional requirements for open water operations are as follows: 
A5.1.4.3.1.  All participants, including briefers will be equipped with adequate 
flotation and spare flotation will be positioned aboard vessel. (T-2) 
A5.1.4.3.2.  Ensure adequate medical coverage is available. (T-2) 
A5.1.4.3.3.  If needed to conduct open water operations, SERE Specialists will be 
trained and certified on personal watercraft, power boats, and/or other vessels. 
Personnel will complete boating safety course and/or United States Coast Guard 
boating safety course. 
A5.1.4.4.  Rotary-wing/tilt rotor requirements. In addition to environmental factors, 
medical considerations, recovery TTP, etc. training for rotary-wing/tilt rotor crewmembers 
will also include “hands-on” application of an approved HEED for assigned aircrews. 
Additionally, units will utilize the SWET as a method of reinforcing “hard skill” 
requirements associated with underwater egress. When conducting hands on breathing 
device and SWET operations, the operating instructions/plans of instruction will also 
include the following additional requirements: (T-2) 
 
 
52 
DAFI10-3004  18 MARCH 2025 
A5.1.4.4.1.  SERE Specialists conducting this training require a thorough 
understanding of dive physiology. Personnel may receive this training either through 
basic civilian dive courses, military dive certification, or through in-unit continuation 
training. (T-2) 
A5.1.4.4.2.  To ensure aircrew safety, HEED and/or SWET training must be conducted 
in a controlled environment, i.e., swimming pool. Depth for personnel utilizing the 
approved devices will not exceed four feet. (T-2) 
A5.1.4.4.3.  SWET. As a minimum, training objectives should require participants to 
clear the HEED under water using both approved techniques (in accordance with US 
Navy HEED video maintained on the GA/SERE SharePoint site) and breathe 
successfully under water, maintain reference point, release, and effectively egress the 
SWET. Participants will be required to demonstrate proficiency with the HEED prior 
to entering the SWET. (T-2) 
A5.1.5.  The matrixes identify basic concepts needed for consideration when conducting water 
survival training. These concepts apply when conducting operations in both open and protected 
waters.

ISOPREP MANAGEMENT 
A7.1.  General.  This attachment defines key responsibilities and tasks to implement PRMS 
ISOPREPs and assigns individual responsibilities for ISOPREP development, updates, managerial 
duties, responsibilities, and oversight requirements for DAF personnel. 
A7.1.1.  PRMS is the CCMD-directed program of record for deployed member’s ISOPREP 
information when isolated. An ISOPREP is a record used by recovery forces to identify or 
authenticate individuals who are isolated or in captivity. ISOPREP requirements are addressed 
in JP 3-50.  
A7.1.2.  PRMS enables ISOPREP development, storage, update, retrieval, and system 
management by individuals and Unit Managers (UMs). PRMS is a web-based application on 
SIPRNET which supports management of ISOPREP information. Upon notification of an 
isolating event, the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC)/Personnel Recovery Coordination 
Cell (PRCC) uses PRMS to search and immediately access ISOPREP information to support 
recovery operations. PRMS eliminates the need to forward ISOPREP data to JPRC/PRCC 
during combat operations. ISOPREP information is classified as CONFIDENTIAL once 
completed and should be carefully safeguarded to prevent unnecessary compromise. See 
Attachment 8 for ISOPREP completion guidance. 
A7.2.  Responsibilities for PRMS ISOPREP/EPA Component.

software also contains a self-guided Computer Based Training to assist individuals with 
completing an accurate ISOPREP and UM duties. 
A8.1.1.  The ISOPREP contains personal data known only to the isolated individual for use by 
recovery forces to positively authenticate the IP. The ISOPREP is the most important source 
of authentication data in use by U.S. and some allied forces. Proper completion, use, and 
archiving is critical to successful recovery efforts. As a permanent record, it is a vital part of 
long-term prisoner of war (POW) missing in action (MIA) accountability. ISOPREPs will 
reside in the PRMS database, which is replicated on both the JPRA national server and 
USSOCOM’s dedicated PRMS server (when available). In all cases, unit commanders will 
ensure personnel comply with applicable theater entry requirements prior to deployment. Once 
an ISOPREP is completed by the individual, the document is classified as CONFIDENTIAL 
and should be carefully safeguarded to prevent unnecessary compromise; do not include 
information of a higher classification level on the ISOPREP (DD Form 1833). (T-2) 
A8.1.2.  Individuals completing an ISOPREP for the first time must take care to ensure the 
form is filled out completely and accurately. Authentication statements, numbers, etc., that are 
developed incorrectly could significantly complicate or compromise the authentication and 
recovery process. Unit PRMS managers/unit deployment managers will assist if necessary.
