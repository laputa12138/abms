Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Purpose.  This publication provides the tactics, techniques, and procedures for the Ground 
Surgical Team (GST).  The GST provides the initial surgical and post-surgical critical care 
capability for the Air Force Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) construct.  The team can 
also operate independently in austere locations forward of an established medical treatment facility 
(MTF).  This publication focuses on the team’s stand-alone and crisis response capabilities.  It 
provides a source document for developing standardized policies, operating procedures, training 
programs, and allowance standards.  Operation plans and regional guidance provide more specific 
information that amplify and tailor the guidance contained in this publication.  See AFTTP 3-
42.71, Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) and Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH), for 
more information on EMEDS operations. 
1.2.  Background.  Recent operational challenges supporting forces in forward locations 
combined with emerging doctrine on contested battlespace concepts prompted the Air Force 
Medical Service (AFMS) to reevaluate its portfolio of deployable medical assets and aeromedical 
evacuation platforms. Limited medical infrastructure and long travel distances to the nearest 
trauma care capability within the United States Africa Command and remote parts of United States 
Central Command areas of responsibility have led to an increased requirement for small-scale, 
mobile surgical teams able to provide area support for conventional and special operations forces.  
These evolving and growing combatant command mission requirements far exceed the available 
assets in the AFMS inventory. The Air Force Surgeon General (USAF/SG) tasked the three 
manpower and equipment force packaging (MEFPAK) responsible agencies (MRAs) to review 
their current unit type code (UTC) portfolios and identify areas where similar training and mission 
sets could be leveraged. 
1.2.1.  GST Development.  In 2016, the Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility 
Command, and Air Force Special Operations Command MRAs and select subject matter 
experts partnered to develop a next generation small surgical team.  ACC identified three 
existing UTCs from the EMEDS construct that could be modified to meet these new 
requirements without jeopardizing current operational requirements. 
1.2.2.  UTC Changes.  The GST replaces FFMFS, Mobile Field Surgical Team (MFST), and 
FFEP1, Expeditionary Critical Care Team (ECCT), on the EMEDS Health Response Team 
(HRT) and FFEP5, Surgical Augmentation Team, in EMEDS+25. 
1.3.  Evolution of Air Force Forward Surgical Capabilities.  The 20-person Flying Ambulance 
Surgical Trauma (FAST) team was one of the Air Force’s first prototypes for delivery of life-
saving trauma care closer to combat casualties.  Developed in response to the 1983 U.S. Marine 
barracks bombing in Beirut, the FAST capability was fielded in 1984 in United States Air Forces 
Europe.  Lessons learned from operations in Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Somalia, and the Balkans in 
the mid-1980s to early 1990s led to the development of the five-person MFST in 1995.  The MFST 
served as the smallest and most mobile Air Force module for the provision of advanced emergency 
medical and surgical care. 
1.3.1.  EMEDS Mission.  In the late 1990s, Joint and Air Force doctrine shifted toward a four-
phased continuum of care focused on rapid evacuation of casualties and smaller in-theater 
AFTTP3-42.77  16 NOVEMBER 2018 
3 
MTFs.  Following the Air Force’s transition to an Aerospace Expeditionary Force concept in 
1998, the USAF/SG tasked ACC with development of a modular and scalable theater 
hospitalization capability.  In September 1999, the USAF/SG approved the EMEDS and AFTH 
concept of operations.  The MFST provided the core surgical and emergency medicine 
capability, and the ECCT provided the core perioperative and critical care capability. 
1.3.2.  Unconventional Medical Support Missions.  The early part of Operations IRAQI 
FREEDOM and ENDURING FREEDOM brought increasing requirements for unconventional 
mission support.  The combatant commands frequently requested MFST support as the team’s 
small size and mobility were well matched to the mission.  In 2003, five MFSTs were 
transferred to AFSOC to more effectively support their specialized training requirements.  The 
remaining MFSTs remained allocated to ACC to support EMEDS requirements.

CAPABILITIES 
2.1.  Mission.  The GST provides damage control surgery, damage control resuscitation, and 
emergency care of injured or critically ill patients in dynamic, austere environments outside of 
established support and patient movement capabilities.  Its primary mission is to stabilize and 
prepare patients for casualty evacuation (CASEVAC).  The team can perform up to 10 surgical 
interventions and provide postoperative patient holding for up to three patients at a time for a 
maximum of 12 hours without resupply. 
2.2.  Scope of Care.  The GST performs damage control and emergency medicine interventions 
required to save life, limb, and eyesight and stabilize critically injured patients for transport.  A 
stabilized patient is defined as airway protected, hemorrhage controlled, shock treated, and 
fractures stabilized. The team is skilled in multi-system trauma, blunt and penetrating trauma, 
shock and hemorrhage control, respiratory and airway management, limited management of 
thermal injuries, limb revascularization, stabilization of fractures, and major wound debridement.  
Surgical techniques focus on hemorrhage control and minimal fluid administration until bleeding 
is controlled.  Weight restrictions limit the amount of crystalloid and blood products available for 
fluid resuscitations. 
2.2.1.  Blood Supplies.  The GST has limited type-specific emergency whole blood collection 
and transfusion capability.  No formal blood grouping, typing, or crossmatching capability is 
available.  Uncrossmatched Group O packed red blood cells and Group AB or A fresh frozen 
plasma or liquid plasma, if available, will be issued for all casualty care. 
2.2.2.  Laboratory.  The GST has no formal laboratory capability.  Lab testing is limited to 
waived or moderate complexity testing to include provider performed microscopy. 
2.2.3.  Medications.  Supplies are limited to essential emergency medical care and resuscitative 
surgery pharmaceuticals. 
2.2.4.  Radiology.  Radiographic imaging is limited to handheld sonography testing. 
2.3.  FFGST, Ground Surgical Team.  Table 2.1 lists the manpower detail for FFGST.  All team 
members provide cross-functional support as needed commensurate with their skill levels and 
training. See Chapter 3 for more information on deployment and employment.

OPERATIONS 
3.1.  Pre-Deployment.    Team members should work closely with the medical readiness office to 
prepare for deployment and review pertinent deployment information.  This information may 
include reporting instructions, pre-deployment training requirements, force protection threats, and 
intelligence reports.  Deploying personnel are responsible for following the pre-deployment 
requirements outlined in AFI 10-403. 
3.2.  Deployment.  The GST is the smallest deployable Air Force module for delivery of advanced 
emergency medical and surgical care.  The team deploys with man-portable field packs configured 
to support rapid setup.  UTC team chiefs should assess the deployability of assigned equipment 
UTCs with medical logistics personnel and identify shortfalls.  Deploying commanders should 
ensure an adequate number of personnel are qualified in pallet build-up and cargo handling 
procedures (to include hazardous, protected, and classified cargo) to serve as cargo increment 
monitors during deployment and redeployment IAW AFI 24-602V2, Preparation and Movement 
of Air Force Cargo, even if equipment is not co-located with the team.  Note:  Most EMEDS 
equipment within the continental United States (CONUS) is stored at consolidated storage and 
deployment centers. 
3.2.1.  Hazardous Cargo.  Hazardous cargo is subject to Defense Transportation Regulation 
(DTR) 4500.9-R-Part III, Mobility, AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for 
Military Air Shipments, and host nation requirements.  The health services administrator or 
surgical service technician typically serves as a certifying official and should be trained in 
packing, handling, and inspection procedures. 
3.2.2.  Protected Cargo.  Protected cargo includes controlled substances, items vulnerable to 
theft, and weapons and ammunition. The anesthesiologist typically serves as the controlled 
medical item custodian.  The controlled medical item custodian should witness and verify the 
packaging of medically controlled items.  At the deployed location, controlled items should be 
stored in locked rooms or containers and managed IAW AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics 
Support.  Units are responsible for assigning primary and alternate weapons and ammunition 
couriers to ensure security and accountability during transit IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated 
Defense, and AFI 21-201, Munitions Management. 
3.2.3.  Classified Cargo.  Classified material should be packaged, marked, safeguarded, and 
transported IAW AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program.  Units are responsible 
for assigning appropriately cleared and trained couriers to accompany classified material. 
3.3.  Employment.  The GST can provide initial stabilization within 15 minutes of arrival at the 
employment location and reach full mission capability within 30 minutes.  The team operates from 
shelters of opportunity if not attached to an established EMEDS or other MTF.  In austere 
locations, the team may need to change locations multiple times on short notice.  Optimally, the 
GST should operate from a location with adequate security and ECS/BOS to complete their 
mission.  Table 3.1 lists the most common employment scenarios.

Tasking 
Description 
Forward deployment 
The GST may be tasked to deploy from an EMEDS location 
to temporarily support operations in austere locations 
without immediate access to damage control surgery and 
resuscitation capabilities. 
Standalone medical operations 
The GST may function as the sole medical resource in a 
number of scenarios such as contested environments, 
humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and unconventional 
operations. 
Surge augmentation 
The GST may deploy to provide surge augmentation for 
other deployed medical capabilities.  The team and 
equipment set can be used to increase operative and 
postoperative care capabilities. 
3.3.1.  Team Member Roles and Cross-Functional Support.  Each member of the GST provides 
a specific skill set and performs a unique function.  Team integrity should be maintained to the 
maximum extent possible.  Due to the small size of the team and unique mission, all team 
members (clinical and non-clinical) should have a basic understanding of each team member’s 
role and be prepared to provide cross-functional support as needed commensurate with their 
skill levels and training. 
3.3.1.1.  Anesthesiologist.  The anesthesiologist provides perioperative anesthesia care to 
surgical patients to include preoperative evaluation and resuscitation, intraoperative 
anesthetic management, postoperative stabilization, sedation, pain management, and 
preparation for transport.  The anesthesiologist also provides hemodynamic and respiratory 
support, sedation, and pain management for non-surgical candidates.  The anesthesiologist 
serves as the GST’s controlled substances officer and is responsible for maintaining the 
team’s medication supply.  The anesthesiologist may assist with preoperative and 
postoperative clinical care and help maintain the GST’s blood supply inventory. 
3.3.1.2.  Critical Care Nurse.  The critical care nurse is responsible for emergency care, 
perioperative nursing, postoperative critical care, and preparation of patients for transport.  
The critical care nurse manages the GST’s blood supply and may assist the anesthesiologist 
in maintaining the team’s controlled substances supply. 
3.3.1.3.  Emergency Services Physician.  The emergency services physician in 
collaboration with the general surgeon is responsible for initial resuscitation, triage, pre-
hospital care, advanced critical care life support, and trauma support.  Responsibilities 
include basic management of toxicological emergencies, minor surgical stabilization 
procedures, and limited management of thermal injuries.  The emergency services 
physician may assist the general surgeon in surgery, provide postoperative support, and 
help prepare patients for transport. 
3.3.1.4.  General Surgeon. The general surgeon in collaboration with the emergency 
services physician is responsible for initial resuscitation, triage, pre-hospital care, advanced 
critical life support, and trauma support.  Responsibilities include evaluation and treatment 
8 
AFTTP3-42.77  16 NOVEMBER 2018 
of traumatic injuries and surgical diseases, performance of minor and major surgical 
procedures (to include damage control surgery), and critical care of traumatically injured 
and postoperative patients. 
3.3.1.5.  Health Services Administrator.  The health services administrator is the only non-
clinical position on the team.  The health services administrator is responsible for command 
and control (C2), logistics, communications, CASEVAC coordination, reporting, and 
administration functions.  As the plans and readiness officer, the health services 
administrator needs to fully understand and be able to communicate the team’s capabilities, 
limitations, and unique planning considerations at the tactical and operational level. 
3.3.1.6.  Surgical Service Craftsman.  The surgical service craftsman is responsible for 
managing the operating room capability and serves as the general surgeon’s primary 
technician assistant.  Responsibilities include prepping patients for surgery, managing 
surgical instrument sets, and overseeing surgical instrument sterilization.  The surgical 
service craftsman serves as equipment custodian and assists the health services 
administrator with ordering medical supplies. 
3.3.2.  CASEVAC.  The GST operates in areas without close aeromedical evacuation support.  
The GST health services administrator is responsible for coordinating CASEVAC through the 
host unit or appropriate theater patient evacuation control center IAW theater policy. Patients 
should be transported with their medical records, personal effects, and medically essential 
items.  The GST is not equipped to furnish the medical equipment and supplies required to 
support patients during transport.  The attending physician is responsible for ensuring that all 
necessary forms are completed IAW AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient 
Administration Functions. 
3.3.3.  Documenting Patient Care.  Medical personnel are responsible for documenting the care 
provided to U.S. personnel IAW Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6490.03, 
Deployment Health, AFI 41-210, and theater surgeon policy.  Patient encounter data should be 
filed electronically through Theater Medical Information Program – Air Force (TMIP-AF) if 
network access is available.  If access to TMIP-AF is not available, paper forms should be 
used.  Examples include SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care, DD 1380, Tactical 
Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Card, DD 3019, Resuscitation Record, and AF 3899, 
Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record. 
3.3.4.  Care for Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW).  If tasked to treat an EPW, the GST should 
coordinate with security forces or equivalent authority to provide armed guards for prisoners.  
Following essential care, EPWs are transferred to host nation or U.S. Army EPW management 
authorities.  See Joint Publication (JP) 3-63, Detainee Operations, for guidance. 
3.3.5.  Reporting Requirements.  Team chiefs are responsible for submitting required 
operational reports IAW AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting (OPREP), and specific 
combatant commander, joint force commander (JFC), and commander, Air Force forces 
(COMAFFOR) requirements.  Team chiefs are responsible for submitting after-action reports 
and lessons learned IAW AFI 10-204, Participation in Joint and National Exercises, and AFI 
90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program. 
3.3.6.  Maintenance and Disposition of Records.  Records associated with GST operations 
should be maintained and disposed of IAW AFI 33-364, Records Disposition–Procedures and 
AFTTP3-42.77  16 NOVEMBER 2018 
9 
Responsibilities, and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records. Patient medical records, 
personally identifiable information, and protected health information are managed and 
protected IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program, and AFI 41-210. 
Medical personnel are responsible for complying with Public Law 93-579 (as amended) 
Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 104-191 (as amended) Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, Freedom of Information Act, Drug Abuse and Treatment 
Act, and Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse amendments. 
3.4.  Redeployment.  The team can repack its equipment and supplies and be ready to redeploy to 
a new location within 30 minutes.  The health services administrator is responsible for chain of 
custody and redeployment of equipment.  Before departure, team chiefs should provide the Air 
Force Forces Surgeon General (AFFOR/SG) with shipment status and a copy of the shipping 
documents.

COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) RELATIONSHIPS 
4.1.  C2 Definitions.  C2 is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated 
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.  (Source: 
DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms). 
4.1.1.  Operational Control (OPCON).  OPCON is the authority to perform those functions of 
command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, 
assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to 
accomplish the mission (Source: DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms). OPCON 
should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations, such as 
subordinated JFCs and Service or functional component commanders.  Normally, JFCs 
exercise OPCON of assigned and attached Air Force forces through the COMAFFOR (Source: 
Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-30, Command and Control). 
4.1.2.  Tactical Control (TACON).  TACON is the authority over forces that is limited to the 
detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area 
necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned (Source: DOD Dictionary of Military and 
Associated Terms).  TACON provides sufficient authority for controlling and directing the 
application of force or tactical use of combat support assets within the assigned mission or task 
(Source: Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-30). 
4.1.3.  Administrative Control (ADCON).  ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority 
over subordinate or other organizations with respect to administration and support (Source: 
DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms).  It includes control of resources and 
equipment, personnel management, and discipline.  Normally, the COMAFFOR exercises 
ADCON over assigned Air Force personnel and at least those elements of ADCON that are 
necessary to ensure mission accomplishment over those Air Force personnel attached to the 
Air Force component commander (Source: Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-30). 
4.2.  C2 Structure in EMEDS Operations.  C2 for expeditionary medical units is through line of 
the Air Force commanders.  Air Force elements deployed into a theater are typically aligned under 
the command of the COMAFFOR.  The COMAFFOR exercises ADCON responsibilities for 
assigned and attached Air Force forces IAW Air Force Doctrine Volume 3, Command.  GST 
personnel operate under the local direction of the deployed expeditionary unit commander (usually 
the EMEDS or AFTH commander). 
4.3.  C2 Structure in Standalone Operations.  The GST operates under the C2 structure 
established by the joint task force (JTF) or air expeditionary task force to which it is assigned.  
Upon arrival in theater, the GST should request a chain of command briefing from the JTF/SG or 
AFFOR/SG office.  Usually, the COMAFFOR retains ADCON.  The Service component retains 
OPCON, and the ground force commander retains TACON.

COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
5.1.  Communications Requirements.  The GST is not equipped with the communications 
infrastructure needed for independent operation and relies on host base communications units.  The 
team requires access to the Defense Switched Network, secure voice communications, Non-
classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), and Secret Internet Protocol Router 
Network (SIPRNET) to communicate patient conditions and patient movement requirements.  See 
Attachment 2 for more information on communications requirements. 
5.2.  Communications Equipment.  The GST deploys with a satellite/iridium phone.  These 
devices are allocated IAW the allowance standard and operational requirements.  They are 
primarily used during deployment and redeployment phases and to augment established 
communications infrastructure in austere environments. 
5.3.  Computer Systems.  The computer issued to the GST includes the DOD Standard Desktop 
Configuration and applications for managing patient encounter data and ordering medical supplies. 
5.3.1.  Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)-Theater. 
AHLTA-Theater is the electronic health record management system for theater environments.  
It maintains much of the same design and functionality as the AHLTA system used at MTFs 
in CONUS and sustaining bases.  AHLTA-Theater transmits data to a central theater database 
called the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS).  In low to no communication environments, 
data is stored locally and forwarded when Internet connectivity is restored. 
5.3.2.  Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) Customer Assistance Module 
(DCAM).  DCAM is the primary order management system for deployed medical units 
providing unit-level support.  DCAM provides a store and forward capability to support low 
to no communication environments. 
5.3.3.  Specialty-Specific Applications.  Team members may have access to the specialty-
specific applications listed in Table 5.1.

Chapter 6 
INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY 
6.1.  Integration and Interoperability with Other Systems.  The GST may support elements of 
an air expeditionary force, components of the aeromedical evacuation system, joint medical 
counterparts, Special Operations Forces, and other federal and civilian agencies.  In some 
instances, theater planners may request medical support for beddown locations not associated with 
a typical air expeditionary force or ECS/BOS infrastructure.  The GST functions as an integral part 
of the supported unit and should participate in mission planning and briefings.  The GST is 
expected to leverage and work in conjunction with other medical assets that may be attached to 
the supported unit (for example, in a mass casualty event).  In certain situations, the GST may 
combine with another medical asset for the duration of the mission or for a limited basis to create 
a theater medical capability (for example, co-locating a GST with a medical evacuation element). 
6.2.  Expeditionary 
Combat 
Support 
(ECS)/Base 
Operating 
Support 
(BOS) 
Requirements.  The GST deploys with limited organic capability and requires ECS/BOS.  
ECS/BOS requirements include (but are not limited to) billeting, shelter, messing and other 
consumable materials, power, water, ice, latrines, showers, laundry, waste management, exterior 
lighting, transportation (to include ambulances and general purpose vehicles), fuels, vehicle 
maintenance, equipment maintenance, general supplies, contracting, information and 
communications systems support, mortuary affairs, public affairs, chaplain, linguist, personnel and 
vehicle decontamination, and security.  ECS/BOS may be provided using the host base’s 
capabilities, deployable bare base systems, and contracted civilian support. See Attachment 2 for 
quantified estimates on required support.

Chapter 7 
SECURITY 
7.1.  Security Roles and Responsibilities.   Medical personnel are non-combatant assets, and 
along with medical equipment, have protected status under the Geneva Conventions and the Law 
of Armed Conflict.  Medical personnel and war reserve materiel assemblages are protected IAW 
AFI 31-101.  Current threat assessments provided by the combatant commander and local threat 
conditions established by the JTF, air expeditionary wing, or air expeditionary group commander 
dictate all local security measures.  GST members are responsible for ensuring security measures 
are in place to protect patients and personnel.  GST personnel are responsible for following 
personal protection measures outlined in AFI 31-101, area of responsibility security briefings, 
established force protection requirements, and local guidance.  GST personnel follow theater 
arming instructions as directed by reporting instructions and theater guidance. 
7.2.  Physical Security.  Security forces guard medical facilities only if deemed necessary as part 
of the Integrated Defense Plan.  If the threat changes, security forces may appoint an augmented 
detail to provide force protection and entry control (for example, a mass casualty event).  The 
supported unit provides security for any patient determined to require a security detail or escort.  
The GST does not have the manning to provide this layer of security. 
7.3.  Operations Security (OPSEC).  GST personnel are responsible for protecting mission-
critical information (to include medical or casualty information) IAW theater policy and AFI 10-
701, Operations Security (OPSEC).  Classified information should be transmitted by secure means 
and protected IAW AFI 16-1404.  Situation reports, medical surveillance, site locations, and 
compiled patient data are examples of information that may be classified. 
7.4.  Security of Weapons and Ammunition.  Weapons and ammunition should be secured IAW 
AFI 31-101 and local procedures.  In austere environments where access to an armory may not be 
available, GST members are responsible for safe storage of weapons and ammunition.  GST 
members should coordinate with the supported unit on local weapons handling guidance.  
Considerations include rules for engagement on searching and clearing patients of weapons and 
explosives, who is allowed to carry weapons into the medical treatment area (e.g., medical facility, 
shelter of opportunity), and security measures for handling the discovery of unauthorized weapons 
or explosives.

TRAINING 
8.1.  Medical Readiness Training Requirements.  Personnel assigned to a GST UTC should 
complete individual, deployment, and unit training requirements IAW AFI 41-106, Medical 
Readiness Program Management, and MRA guidance.  Examples include Readiness Skills 
Training, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear emergency preparedness and response, 
clinical AFSC training, and information management/information technology.  Completion of all 
medical readiness training and equivalency training should be documented in the Medical 
Readiness Decision Support System.  Theater-unique training requirements are identified in 
deployment reporting instructions or line remarks. 
8.2.  UTC Formal Training.  GST personnel should complete in-residence formal training upon 
initial assignment to the UTC and IAW the AFMS Medical Readiness Category III Training Guide.  
UTC team integrity should be maintained to the maximum extent possible. 
8.2.1.  Ground Surgical Team Training – Austere Phase 1.  This course provides foundational 
training on how to function as a small surgical team.  It focuses on allowance standard 
familiarization, individual and cross-functional team roles and responsibilities, clinical 
practice guidelines, and scenario-based training.  The course is held at the Center for 
Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills (C-STARS) in Baltimore, MD. 
8.2.2.  EMEDS HRT Course.  This course provides field operational training for 
commissioned officers and enlisted personnel assigned to specific EMEDS UTCs.  The course 
is held at the Camp Bullis Medical Readiness Training site, Joint Base San Antonio, TX. 
8.2.3.  Ground Surgical Team Training – Austere Phase 2.  This capstone field exercise 
provides realistic field operational training tied the team’s mission essential tasks and 
deployment scenarios.  The course is held at the Camp Bullis Medical Readiness Training site, 
Joint Base San Antonio, TX. 
8.3.  Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs).  METLs are designed to help assess, measure, and 
report a unit’s ability to perform its mission.  Personnel are expected to be proficient in the EMEDS 
Core METLs as well as their UTC-specific METLs.  Core METLs and UTC-specific METLs are 
available on the ACC/SG MEFPAK Playbook at https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/12173/default.aspx 
or from the ACC/SGX training branch. 
8.4.  Pallet Buildup Training.  Pallet buildup training is required for the health services 
administrator (041A) and surgical service technician (4N1) positions.  Training is conducted at the 
base level.  Personnel attend refresher training as needed. 
8.5.  Hazardous Cargo Training.  Hazardous cargo training is required for the health services 
administrator (041A) and surgical service technician (4N1) positions.  Training is conducted at the 
base level.  Personnel attend refresher training as needed. 
8.6.  Weapons Training.  Weapons training requirements are outlined in AFI 36-2654, Combat 
Arms Program, and AFI 41-106.  The team deploys IAW theater commander weapons policy.

LOGISTICS 
9.1.  Medical Logistics Support.  The GST may deploy to environments with limited medical 
logistics support.  Planners should ensure the team deploys with adequate medical supplies and 
equipment to support independent operational requirements.  Austere missions may not allow or 
require establishment of a resupply mechanism.  When resupply is required, medical planners 
establish resupply through a variety of mechanisms, which may include support from a host MTF, 
in-country embassy or military assistance group, or main operating base.  When deployed in 
support of a major regional conflict, the conventional health support system provides medical 
logistics support.  Prior coordination with the supported JTF/SG or AFFOR/SG helps ensure 
adequate medical logistics support is available.  See AFTTP 3-42.8, Expeditionary Medical 
Logistics (EML) System, for more information on medical logistics support. 
9.2.  Supplies and Equipment.  The ground surgical equipment set (FFGS1/AS 938Q) consists 
of man-portable field packs designed to support up to 10 damage control surgeries.  It is designed 
for short-duration, single missions.  The equipment set is configured in three increments that offer 
some degree of built-in resupply.  Increment 1 provides the initial durable and non-durable items 
to handle 1-3 surgical cases.  It consists of 6 bags (A1, A2, B1, B2, C, E).  Increment 2 provides 
supplemental non-durable items to handle an additional 3 surgical cases (patients 4-6).  It consists 
of 3 bags (G1, G2, G3).  Increment 3 is packed identically to increment 1 except the durable items 
are removed, and non-durable items are added to handle 4 surgical cases (patients 7-10).  It consists 
of 6 bags (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6).  Resupply or reconstitution of supplies can be done by line 
item, sub-package, or increment.  For example, if the durable items are still functional, the team 
can alternate increment 2 and increment 3 packages to replenish supplies.  The health services 
administrator is typically responsible for resupply functions.  Team members should contact the 
medical logistics office for assistance with reviewing the allowance standard.
