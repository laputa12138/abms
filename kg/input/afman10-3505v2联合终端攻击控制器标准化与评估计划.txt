Chapter 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1.  Overview.  As part of the Air Force Special Warfare (AFSPECWAR) mission to provide 
precision strike across the spectrum of conflict, the Air Force trains JTACs to support combatant 
command requirements. JTAC Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) programs provide 
commanders and staffs meaningful indicators reflecting a unit’s ability to accomplish its peacetime 
training and combat responsibilities. 
1.2.  Purpose.  The purpose of the JTAC Stan/Eval program is to provide commanders a tool to 
validate readiness and the effectiveness of unit operations, including documentation of individual 
qualifications and capabilities to perform duties across multiple mission sets. 
1.3.  Objectives. 
1.3.1.  Validates unit JTAC training program to support the successful and safe execution of 
the unit’s mission. 
1.3.2.  Ensures the standardization of operational procedures for terminal attack control (TAC) 
IAW AFMAN 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, Joint Publication (JP) 3-09.3 
Close Air Support, and AFTTP 3-1 Joint Terminal Attack Controller. 
1.3.3.  Provides a system to: 
1.3.3.1.  Assess individual JTAC qualifications and readiness levels based upon the 
operational training standards defined in AFMAN 10-3505V1, Joint Terminal Attack 
Controller (JTAC) Training Program. 
1.3.3.2.  Identify trends through analysis of evaluation results and corresponding JTAC 
training programs. 
1.3.3.3.  Implements recommended changes to the JTAC training program, lesson plans, 
standard operating procedures, and governing directives based on the results of evaluations. 
1.3.4.  Ensures units establish processes that verify individual JTACs meet qualification 
requirements prior to the Mission (MSN) evaluation. 
1.3.5.  Ensures unit compliance with operational, training, and administrative directives related 
to JTAC operations. 
1.3.6.  Provides unclassified after-action review feedback using the Stan/Eval Board (SEB) 
process to senior, lateral, and subordinate headquarters through cross-command. 
1.3.7.  Standardizes 
administrative 
procedures 
for 
documenting 
individual 
JTAC 
qualifications. 
1.4.  Key Terms and Definitions. 
1.4.1.  Standardization: Standardization ensures that common JTAC training programs support 
combat air operations based upon proven tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) and are 
IAW established safety standards. When administered in a consistent manner using prescribed 
performance standards, evaluations ensure that individual JTACs are qualified IAW AFMAN 
10-3505V1, this publication, and the JTAC MOA. 
6 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
1.4.2.  Evaluation: Individual JTAC evaluations emphasize either JTAC-specific skills only or 
emphasize combat scenarios that are based upon the mission identification and operational 
plans specified in the Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP), unit designed 
operational capability (DOC) statement, and probable contingency taskings. The scenarios in 
a unit’s evaluation program should be varied to the maximum extent possible to incorporate 
mission sets such as, but not limited to: traditional warfare and irregular warfare, with 
contested and/or degraded operations constraints. To the maximum extent practical, JTAC 
evaluations should incorporate the use of multiple live assets (e.g., indirect fires, naval gunfire, 
threat simulators, maneuver forces). 
1.4.3.  Group: Throughout this document, when referring to a “group”, the standard group is 
an Air Support Operations Group (ASOG) or a Special Tactics Group (STG). Air National 
Guard (ANG) units may not always fall under a standard group. 
1.4.4.  Wing: Throughout this document when referring to a “wing”, the standard wing is an 
Air Ground Operations Wing (AGOW) or Special Operations Wing (SOW). ANG units may 
not always fall under a standard wing. 
1.4.5.  AF Form 1035, AFSPECWAR Evaluation Form: In this publication, when referencing 
logging JTAC evaluations on an AF Form 1035, it must be noted that AFSOC JTACs utilize 
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Form 43, SOF JTAC 
CERTIFICATION OF EVALUATION. 
1.5.  Electronic Products.  The use of electronic products (e.g., spreadsheets, databases, word 
processing) is authorized for items not included in a Headquarters Air Force (HAF)-approved 
electronic system of record (e.g., Automated JTAC Academic Currency Tracking System 
(AJACTS), Oracle © HCM). Printouts of electronic products will be included in an individual’s 
JTAC training and evaluation folder upon Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA), Permanent 
Change of Station (PCS), or Temporary Duty (TDY) deployments in support of exercises and 
contingencies. (T-1)

without caveats. (T-1) 
3.2.1.  While deployed on contingency, exercise, and deployment orders, the 18-month 
evaluation requirement is waived for the duration of the deployment. If a deployed JTAC’s 
evaluation expires during the deployment, the member will be required to receive an evaluation 
upon completion of the deployed tasking. (T-1)  
3.2.2.  During deployments to combat zones, no JTAC evaluations of any type will be 
authorized. (T-1) 
3.2.3.  Members deployed in support of a low-threat environment outside of a combat zone 
(e.g., Korea, Europe), may receive a spot evaluation, recurring JTAC evaluation, JTAC-I 
evaluation, or JTAC-E evaluation when both the owning unit and the expeditionary unit 
commanders concur. 
3.2.3.1.  Units will route the request to conduct evaluations through the affected MAJCOM 
PMs for coordination. (T-2)  
3.2.3.2.  The timing of evaluations of any type will be coordinated between the owning unit 
and expeditionary unit commanders. (T-1) 
3.3.  Dislocated JTACs Stan/Eval Program Management. 
3.3.1.  In the case of transferring to an assignment not requiring JTAC duties, the individual’s

3.3.2.  Deactivation and reactivation of a JTAC’s digital training tracking record is conducted 
by the unit JTAC-PM. (T-1) 
3.3.3.  In the case of transferring to an assignment requiring JTAC duties, but the unit does not 
maintain a JTAC program, the individual JTAC’s training folder may be managed by their 
parent MAJCOM. 
3.3.3.1.  Units that require JTAC(s), but do not maintain a JTAC program, must enter into 
an agreement (MOA, etc...) with a unit that does have a JTAC program to detail 
responsibilities for training and evaluations of the dislocated JTAC(s). (T-2) This 
agreement will be coordinated through each units MAJCOM JTAC-PM, NGB/A3J for 
ANG, or equivalent. (T-2)  
3.3.3.2.  Units that maintain an AF Stan/Eval program may manage JTAC records for 
assigned JTACs.

Chapter 4 
JTAC EVALUATION PROCEDURES 
4.1.  Overview.  The Initial Certification Course (ICC) administers ICT, documented on AF Form 
1036 (Attachment 5), and graduates certified JTACs. The initial JTAC evaluation is administered 
after completing all JTAC Mission Qualification Training (MQT) as outlined in AFMAN 10-
3505V1. Upon successful completion of the initial JTAC evaluation a JTAC is considered 
qualified and MQT complete. JTACs then progress to JTAC CT. 
4.1.1.  The interval between recurring evaluations will not exceed 18 months. 
4.1.2.  JTAC evaluations consist of a Ground-Phase and a MSN evaluation IAW this manual. 
4.1.3.  A recurring evaluation is administered to qualified JTACs who have successfully 
completed an initial evaluation. 
4.1.4.  JTAC evaluations assess performance using JTAC evaluation criteria area 1-25 on 
Table A2.1 and will be documented on an AF Form 1035. (T-1) If required, and in line with 
the JTAC MOA, multiple events can be used to include simulations, practical exercises, to 
complete the evaluation. 
4.2.  Ground-Phase Evaluation.  The Ground-Phase evaluation consists of a 50-question closed- 
book examination derived from the MQF, tasks, and applicable TTPs. The bank of available 
questions will ensure that a minimum of four Ground-Phase evaluations can and will be created 
with no replication of questions across any of the four examinations. (T-1) 
4.2.1.  Successful completion of the examination requires a minimum passing score of 80 
percent. 
4.2.1.1.  Any qualified USAF evaluator may proctor the Ground-Phase evaluation. 
Electronic delivery of the examination is preferred. NOTE: This includes non-
AFSPECWAR evaluators. 
4.2.1.2.  All missed questions must be reviewed and corrected with the evaluator that 
administered the examination. (T-1) 
4.2.1.3.  Ground-Phase evaluations will be completed no earlier than 30 duty days (training 
days for ANG) before the MSN evaluation, and no later than 30 days (training days for 
ANG) after the MSN evaluation. Ground-Phase evaluations must not exceed the current 
eligibility period. (T-1) 
4.2.2.  Individuals failing the Ground-Phase evaluation must complete a successful re-test 
within 10 duty days (training days for ANG), or prior to the current evaluation expiration date, 
whichever comes first. A minimum of 24 hours must elapse before a re-examination can be 
administered to allow for an adequate period of study. (T-1) 
4.2.2.1.  When an individual fails a Ground-Phase evaluation, the evaluator will notify the 
unit commander within one week. (T-3) 
4.2.2.2.  Re-examinations will be accomplished using a different exam. (T-1) Unit 
commander will be notified of successful Ground-Phase evaluation completion within one 
week. (T-3) 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
15 
4.2.2.3.  If the JTAC fails the second Ground-Phase evaluation, the unit commander will 
identify the JTAC as non-qualified and document the Ground-Phase failure on the AF Form 
1035. (T-1) It is the unit commander’s responsibility to determine required training actions 
(e.g., training program, training timeline). This training will be documented on an AF Form 
1035 in Part III, C. in the “Items Requiring Additional Training” section. (T-1) 
4.2.3.  Ground-Phase evaluation documentation procedures. JTAC-Es will enter the test 
version and results of the written examination in the “Ground-Phase” section in Part III of the 
AF Form 1035. (T-1) All missed/reviewed questions will be entered in Part V, “Remarks”, 
“Ground-Phase” section of the AF Form 1035. (T-1) 
4.2.4.  The JTAC-E-PM or alternate will retain the scored answer sheets/computer record until 
the AF Form 1035 is completed and signed by the unit commander. (T-3) If multiple 
examinations are required to successfully complete the Ground-Phase evaluation, the results 
of all Ground-Phase evaluations will be documented in the proper sections of the AF Form 
1035. (T-1) 
4.3.  MSN Evaluation.  The purpose of the MSN evaluation is to ensure individual JTACs are 
qualified to perform the tasks associated with planning, preparation, execution, and assessment for 
conducting CAS missions in a combat environment. 
4.3.1.  MSN evaluations will be conducted using live-fly or JFS-ESC accredited simulators. 
(T-1) A list of all currently accredited simulator/virtual environment/live environment systems 
is maintained by JS J6 DD C5I JFID, Joint Staff J6 Deputy Directorate for Cyber and 
Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Integration, (JCAS Simulation Lead). 
4.3.1.1.  Evaluations conducted in a JFS-ESC accredited simulator will attempt to use at 
least one live pilot flying in support of the scenario. (T-3) 
4.3.1.2.  At the commander’s discretion, with the approval of the JTAC-E-PM, and in 
consultation with the unit Simulator Operator/Maintainer, JTAC evaluations may employ 
Distributed Mission Operations. JTAC evaluations will only employ Distributed Mission 
Operations capabilities provided they do not detract from the evaluation. (T-1) Note: JTAC 
evaluations of any type may be conducted using contract CAS provided the aircraft meet 
the requirements in Table 3.2 in AFMAN 10-3505V1. 
4.3.2.  JTACs will not receive consecutive JTAC qualification evaluations in a simulator. (T-1) 
JTACs may receive consecutive JTAC-I and/or JTAC-E evaluations in a simulator. 
4.3.3.  Any aircraft may be used to accomplish the MSN evaluation with approval from the 
unit commander so long as they meet eligible criteria as designated in AFMAN 10-3505V1. 
Commanders assume the risk when using any aircraft during an evaluation that is not typically 
used in a combat environment for CAS. 
4.3.4.  The evaluation’s focus will be on the JTAC’s ability to accomplish a given mission and 
not a validation of all training received. (T-1) Prior to beginning the MSN evaluation execution 
phase, evaluators will brief the JTAC on: 
4.3.4.1.  Evaluation objectives, areas to be evaluated, grading criteria, safety, and 
emergency procedures/JTAC-E takeover; this requirement cannot be waived. 
4.3.4.2.  The specific roles of role-players and assistants. (T-1). 
16 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
4.3.4.3.  The mission scenario, preliminary planning information and directives/regulations 
applicable to the operating area (MOA/range). (T-1) 
4.3.4.4.  The evaluator will observe and evaluate the JTAC in all areas relevant and 
applicable to the given mission. (T-1)  
4.3.5.  JTACs must be authorized to perform JTAC duties IAW AFMAN 10-3505V1. 
Assistance provided to prevent mission failure will result in an unsatisfactory. (T-1) 
4.3.6.  The JTAC will be responsible for the actions of any assistant(s) for procedural 
errors/omissions and safety violations within their control. (T-1) 
4.3.7.  Evaluation scenarios should implement input scripts such as, but not limited to, 
operations orders, mission graphics, and an Air Tasking Order with Special Instructions. 
4.4.  JTAC-I Evaluations.  Following successful completion of all prerequisites listed in 
AFMAN 10-3505V1, completion of a JTAC-I evaluation is documented on an AF Form 1035. 
4.4.1.  A JTAC-I evaluation will only evaluate items in Table A2.2 (T-2) Note: Instructor 
evaluations do not require a Ground-Phase evaluation. 
4.4.2.  A JTAC-I designation letter signed by the unit commander will be placed in Part II of 
the individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder. (T-2) 
4.4.3.  Recurring JTAC-I evaluations can be conducted in conjunction with a recurring JTAC 
evaluation and/or recurring JTAC-E evaluation. If a recurring JTAC-I evaluation is conducted 
in conjunction with a recurring JTAC evaluation and/or recurring JTAC-E evaluation, it must 
cover all applicable areas of Table A2.1., Table A2.2, and/or Table A2.3. (T-2) JTAC-I 
recurring evaluations must occur within 18 months of their previous JTAC-I evaluation. (T-1) 
4.4.4.  Concurrent recurring JTAC and JTAC-I evaluations must cover all areas of Table 
A2.1., Areas 1-25 and Table A2.2., Area 26 and must be documented on the same AF Form 
1035 unless the JTAC failed the items in Table A2.2, in which case a separate AF Form 1035 
must be filled out. (T-1)  
4.4.5.  A minimum of two JTAC evaluation areas, as defined in Table A2.1, must be instructed 
in a classroom or field environment. (T-1) The JTAC-I will also conduct instruction of an 
individual through a Full Mission Profile as described in AFMAN 10-3505V1. (T-1) The areas 
instructed will be evaluated and annotated on the AF Form 1035. (T-1) 
4.4.6.  If an instructor qualification is lost, it may be regained through an instructor re-
qualification (RQ) evaluation. 
4.4.7.  Following initial certification, the unit commander will award the individual SEI 279 or 
O9D using DAF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job-Training Action, or the appropriate 
automated system. (T-1) Note: SEI 279 or O9D are additive to the members list of qualified 
SEIs and do not replace SEIs 914 or O9C. 
4.5.  JTAC-E Evaluation.  Following successful completion of all prerequisites listed in Chapter 
9 of this AFMAN, completion of a JTAC-E evaluation will be documented on an AF Form 1035. 
(T-1). 
4.5.1.  A JTAC-E evaluation will only evaluate items in Table A2.3 (T-2) Note: These 
evaluations do not require Ground-Phase evaluation. 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
17 
4.5.2.  A JTAC-E designation letter signed by the unit commander will be placed in Part II of 
the individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder. (T-1) 
4.5.2.1.  The commander’s designation letter may be comprehensive and include all 
JTACs/JTAC-Is/JTAC-Es at the unit commander discretion. A letter of Xs is also an 
accepted format. 
4.5.2.2.  Unit commanders will ensure that all JTAC-Es listed on the commander’s 
designation letter (CDL) receive a recurring JTAC-E evaluation within 18 months of their 
previous JTAC-E evaluation. A recurring JTAC-E evaluation does not fulfil the 
requirements of a JTAC MSN evaluation or a JTAC-I evaluation. 
4.5.3.  Observations, analysis, and other substantial actions are directed primarily at the JTAC-
E conducting the evaluation and will not interfere with or affect the individual being evaluated 
except for safety issues. 
4.5.4.  The unit JTAC-E-PM is the only individual authorized to conduct Initial JTAC-E 
evaluations. (T-3) 
4.5.5.  Any qualified JTAC-E (regardless of grade or experience level) may give another 
qualified JTAC-E a recurring JTAC-E evaluation, so long as the evaluation is accomplished 
IAW this AFMAN. (T-3) 
4.5.6.  Contract JTAC-Es will not perform evaluations for other contract JTAC-Es regardless 
of qualification, grade, or experience level. 
4.5.7.  The recurring JTAC-E evaluation can be conducted in conjunction with a recurring 
JTAC evaluation and/or a recurring JTAC-I evaluation. Regardless of whether the JTAC-E 
evaluation is conducted in conjunction with a recurring JTAC evaluation and/or a recurring 
JTAC-I evaluation, the evaluation must cover all applicable areas of Table A2.1., Table A2.2, 
and/or Table A2.3 and be documented on a separate AF Form 1035. (T-1) Example: A 
concurrent recurring JTAC and JTAC-E evaluation would cover all areas of Table A2.1, areas 
1-25 and Table A2.3, area 27 and then be documented on separate AF Forms 1035. 
4.5.8.  Following initial certification, the unit commander will award the individual SEI 281 or 
O9E using DAF Form 2096 or the appropriate automated system. (T-1) Note: SEI 281 or O9E 
are added to the members list of qualified SEIs and do not replace SEIs 914, 279, O9D, or 
O9C. 
4.5.9.  Duties Not Including Controlling (DNIC) JTAC-E. Commanders may authorize a 
DNIC JTAC-E who is qualified, to conduct JTAC evaluations in the simulator. (T-3) Note: 
JTAC-E will not evaluate on items that they are not current and qualified. (T-2) 
4.6.  Evaluation Grading System.  During a JTAC’s evaluation, grades are assigned for each 
area. JTAC-Es will use the grading criteria in this publication to determine overall and individual 
area grades. (T-1)  
4.6.1.  The JTAC-E determines the overall grade based on guidance defined in Table A2.1.  
4.6.2.  Area Grades. Table A2.1., Areas 1-25 establishes mission essential tasks to be 
evaluated during the MSN evaluation-phase and the appropriate grading criteria for those 
tasks: 
18 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
4.6.2.1.  Qualified (“Q”) is the desired level of performance. The JTAC demonstrated a 
satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed JTAC duties within the 
prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 
4.6.2.2.  Qualified-Minus (“Q-”) indicates the JTAC is qualified to perform the assigned 
area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the 
JTAC-E. 
4.6.2.3.  Unsatisfactory (“U”) indicates the JTAC is unqualified to perform the assigned 
task area and requires additional training. 
4.6.2.3.1.  A “U” will be assigned in any area for procedures that failed to achieve 
mission accomplishment. (T-3)  
4.6.2.3.2.  A “U” must be assigned if, at any point during the mission, the JTAC or any 
individual they are directly responsible for compromises safety. (T-1)  
4.6.3.  Errors of omission occur when a function or operation is not performed. 
4.6.4.  Errors of commission occur when a function or operation is performed improperly. 
4.6.5.  The JTAC-E who proctored the evaluation is responsible for filling out the AF Form 
1035 and grading the evaluation. JTAC-E-PM and JTAC-Es will not change or influence an 
evaluation rating (area or overall), that was given by another JTAC-E unless a valid 
administrative error was made. (T-1) 
4.6.5.1.  On a case-by-case basis, the JTAC-E may confer with the unit commander or 
designated representative (i.e., JTAC-E-PM) for guidance on evaluation rating (area or 
overall). 
4.6.5.2.  The unit commander must review the contested evaluation rating and 
approve/disapprove a change or direct another evaluation. (T-2) 
4.7.  Overall JTAC MSN Evaluation Qualification Levels. 
4.7.1.  Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The examinee demonstrated desired performance and 
knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the criteria. 
The evaluator assigns this qualification level when no discrepancies were noted, but may be 
awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 
4.7.1.1.  No U grades were awarded for any graded area/subarea. 
4.7.1.2.  In the judgement of the evaluator, none of the Q- grades precluded awarding of a 
Q1. 
4.7.1.3.  No remedial actions required additional training, only debriefed discrepancies. 
4.7.2.  Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The examinee demonstrated the ability to perform duties 
safely, but there were one or more graded area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was 
assigned. The evaluator assigns this qualification level if: 
4.7.2.1.  Any area is graded a Q- and requires additional training. 
4.7.2.2.  In the judgement of the evaluator, a Q2 may be given if there is justification based 
on Q- performance in one or several graded area(s)/subarea(s). 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
19 
4.7.2.3.  If neither of the conditions in paragraph 4.8.2 are met and an overall grade of Q-
2 is given, the JTAC-E must provide justification in ‘Section VII – Remarks” of the AF 
Form 1035 to detail why a grade of Q-2 was given. (T-1) 
4.7.3.  Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The examinee demonstrated an unacceptable level of 
safety, performance, or knowledge and has failed the evaluation. The evaluator assigns this 
qualification level if: 
4.7.3.1.  Any area graded U requires a qualification level of Q-3. 
4.7.3.2.  In the judgment of the evaluator, a Q-3 may be given if there is justification based 
on Q- performance in one or several non-critical graded area(s)/subarea(s). Example: An 
individual may earn a score of Q- in enough categories that the evaluator determines they 
do not possess the appropriate level of knowledge or did not perform adequately enough 
to earn a passing score. 
4.8.  Timing and Types of Evaluations.  The interval between evaluations will not exceed 18 
months. A JTAC evaluation expires on the last day of the 17th month following the month during 
which the MSN evaluation was successfully completed (e.g., an evaluation completed on 22 Mar 
2017 expires 31 Aug 2018). 
4.8.1.  Recurring JTAC evaluations. The JTAC-E-PM, or a designated representative, will 
schedule recurring JTAC evaluations during the eligibility period. (T-1) 
4.8.2.  Failure to complete a JTAC evaluation within the required 18-month time period results 
in loss of qualification and the individual will be placed into an unqualified status. 
4.8.2.1.  RQ evaluation requirements are detailed in this AFMAN. 
4.8.2.2.  The individual’s RQ AF Form 1035 will include a comment from the approving 
official explaining why the recurring evaluation window was exceeded or if it was waived. 
(T-1) 
4.8.3.  JTACs maintaining instructor qualification must complete initial and recurring 
evaluations of their instructional capability using Table A2.2., Area 26. (T-1) Recurring 
instructor evaluations must be completed within the eligibility period prior to the expiration 
date of the current JTAC evaluation period. 
4.8.3.1.  Concurrent JTAC and JTAC-I evaluations will be completed within 10 duty days 
(training days for ANG) before or after the MSN evaluation phase of a recurring JTAC 
evaluation but not to exceed the expiration date of the current evaluation period. (T-2) 
JTAC-I evaluations conducted outside of this window will be documented on a separate 
AF Form 1035. (T-2) 
4.8.3.2.  Concurrent evaluations that are not completed on the same date will always 
document the completion date as that of the MSN evaluation of the JTAC evaluation, even 
if it is completed in the month preceding that of the JTAC-I evaluation. (T-1) A JTAC-I is 
not qualified if they are not JTAC qualified. Example: A concurrent JTAC/JTAC-I 
evaluation is conducted with the JTAC MSN evaluation occurring on 31 March and the 
JTAC-I occurring on 04 April. The AF Form 1035 date of evaluation will be documented 
as 31 March. 
20 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
4.8.3.3.  To initially qualify as a JTAC-I, the member must meet the requirements listed in 
AFMAN 10-3505V1 and successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation IAW this 
manual. (T-1) An initial instructor evaluation can occur outside of the JTAC evaluation 
eligibility period. 
4.8.3.4.  Recurring evaluation of the member’s ability to instruct will be conducted during 
subsequent, recurring JTAC evaluation eligibility periods. (T-2) The rating of Table A2.2. 
Area 26 will not affect the overall grade of the individual’s JTAC evaluation. (T-2) 
4.8.4.  Spot Evaluations. A spot evaluation is limited in scope and may be accomplished 
outside of the JTAC’s eligibility period. The spot evaluation is used to ensure correction of 
identified discrepancies, or to check a JTAC’s proficiency. It may be either a field evaluation 
and/or Ground-Phase Evaluation. 
4.8.5.  Unit commanders may initiate spot evaluations. Place commander’s discretion of a spot 
evaluation within the AF Form 1035. 
4.8.5.1.  Spot evaluations may evaluate one or more portions of Table A2.1 but will not be 
used to evaluate everything. Spot evaluations do not reset the eligibility period. 
4.8.5.2.  The notification period for a spot evaluation is not associated with any specific 
timeframe, but can be specified at the commander’s discretion and in coordination with the 
JTAC-E-PM. 
4.8.6.  No-Notice Evaluations. No-Notice (N/N) evaluations provide the commander a review 
of daily JTAC performance and an assessment of the unit’s training effectiveness. N/N 
evaluations may be conducted at any time and are conducted as directed by the unit 
commander. The unit commander will annotate a statement directing the N/N evaluation on 
the AF Form 1035. (T-2) 
4.8.6.1.  An evaluation will be considered a N/N evaluation when the examinee is notified 
of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The 
beginning of normal preparation will be determined by the evaluator, not to exceed 24-
hours. (T-3) The intent is to preclude advanced preparation for the mission or task. 
However, the examinee must be notified of the N/N evaluation prior to initiation of the 
evaluated task. (T-1) Note:  Informing the examinee after the fact is not allowed.   
4.8.6.2.  A N/N evaluation will update a qualification expiration date. (T-1) 
4.8.7.  RQ. A RQ evaluation is administered to remedy the loss of qualification due to a Q-3, 
expiration of a required JTAC evaluation, or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed 
downgrade. 
4.8.7.1.  A RQ evaluation is not used for a failed initial evaluation as no qualification was 
established. 
4.8.7.2.  A JTAC RQ evaluation due to a Q-3 must be completed within 90 days (training 
days for ANG) of completing the appropriate commander-directed training. (T-1) 
4.9.  Failure to Pass the MSN Evaluation.  Evaluators will notify the unit commander, or 
designated representative, when an individual receives an overall “Q-3” on any evaluation within 
one week of the failed evaluation. (T-3)  
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
21 
4.9.1.  Following a failure, the JTAC will only be authorized to control while under the 
supervision of a qualified JTAC-I. (T-1) 
4.9.1.1.  A separate AF Form 1035 will be completed for each MSN evaluation. (T-1) MSN 
evaluation mission data from the previous “Q-3” AF Form 1035 will not be annotated on 
the RQ evaluation’s AF Form 1035. (T-1)  
4.9.1.2.  The passing JTAC Ground-Phase Evaluation score will be annotated on the RQ 
Evaluation AF Form 1035. (T-1) 
4.9.2.  Failure of initial MSN evaluation. Individual will remain in supervised status until 
successfully evaluated. (T-1)  
4.9.2.1.  The JTAC-E evaluating the individual’s MSN evaluation determines what 
additional training is required prior to re-attempting an initial evaluation. 
4.9.2.2.  Failure of the re-attempt. The re-attempt at the initial evaluation will be conducted 
no later than 60 calendar days (training days for ANG) after the failure. (T-3) 
4.9.2.3.  Commanders may grant a 30-calendar day (training days for ANG) extension if 
necessary. 
4.9.3.  Failure of recurring MSN evaluation. If a JTAC fails the MSN evaluation portion of a 
recurring evaluation, all additional training and an RQ Evaluation must be completed no later 
than 90 days (training days for ANG) after the failure. (T-1) A different JTAC-E should 
conduct the RQ evaluation. 
4.9.4.  Failure of RQ evaluation. RQ evaluations may be administered as early as the next 
calendar day if all assigned additional training has been completed. Successfully passed 
Ground-Phase evaluations remain valid for RQ of a MSN evaluation as long as it is completed 
during the original evaluation eligibility period. (T-1) The evaluator conducting the RQ 
evaluation will annotate previous results of the Ground-Phase on AF Form 1035. (T-1) 
4.9.4.1.  RQ evaluations outside of the eligibility period require a new Ground-Phase 
evaluation. 
4.9.4.2.  If the failed RQ evaluation is the second consecutive failure, refer to AFMAN 10-
3505V1 for failure to progress procedures. (T-1) 
4.9.5.  JTAC-Is and JTAC-Es receiving an unsatisfactory grade “U” in any area in Table A2.2. 
or Table A2.3, will not perform JTAC-I or JTAC-E duties until successfully requalified. (T-1) 
4.9.6.  JTAC-Is and JTAC-Es receiving two “U” grades in any area of Table A2.2. or Table 
A2.3 will lose their JTAC-I and or JTAC-E status and unit commanders will remove the 
individual from these duties in writing. (T-1) 
4.9.7.  JTAC-Is and JTAC-Es who receive two consecutive “Q-3” grades on a JTAC 
evaluation/RQ evaluation, will lose JTAC-I and JTAC-E status, and unit commanders will 
remove the individual from the CDL. (T-1) Note: Items in Table A2.2 and Table A2.3 do not 
affect JTAC status. 
4.9.7.1.  Individuals that have been removed from JTAC-I or JTAC-E duties must conduct 
a commander directed requalification training-training program and satisfactorily complete 
a RQ JTAC-I evaluation or RQ JTAC-E evaluation to regain their status. (T-2) 
22 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
4.9.7.1.1.  Once successfully complete with these requirements, unit commanders may 
add the individuals back to the CDL. 
4.9.7.1.2.  If the commander decides not to requalify the individual, the appropriate SEI 
must be removed from their personnel records. (T-1) 
4.9.8.  Post-Evaluation Procedures. Evaluators will thoroughly debrief the JTAC, the JTAC’s 
supervisor, and the JTAC’s unit leadership. (T-3) 
4.10.  Evaluation Remedial Actions.  Remedial actions identify the process for resolving 
discrepancies and/or assigning additional training. 
4.10.1.  Debriefed Discrepancy. A debriefed discrepancy is a remedial action accomplished 
during debrief of the evaluation wherein the JTAC-E provides instruction concerning the 
discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or 
proficiency. 
4.10.2.  Additional Training. Additional training is any training recommended by the JTAC-E 
to remedy a discrepancy identified during the evaluation debrief. 
4.10.2.1.  Additional training may include, but is not limited to, self-study, ground 
instruction, simulator, live-fly training, or any combination of the aforementioned tasks. 
4.10.2.2.  Additional training must include demonstration of satisfactory knowledge or 
proficiency to a JTAC-E or JTAC-I (as stipulated in the Additional Training description) 
to qualify as completed. (T-1) The JTAC-E will indicate on the AF Form 1035 if the 
additional training must be accomplished before controlling unsupervised. (T-1) 
4.10.2.3.  The JTAC-E-PM will document all failures to complete additional training 
within the specified timeframe with a memorandum for record signed by the commander. 
The memorandum for record is placed in the individual’s JTAC Training Folder on top of 
the appropriate evaluation form IAW Attachment A3.1.3.1. (T-1) 
4.10.2.4.  All additional training will be documented on AF Form 1035 IAW this 
publication. (T-1) 
4.10.2.5.  If the JTAC fails to complete any assigned additional training IAW paragraph 
4.10.2, the Squadron commander will review the situation and determine whether further 
additional training should be assigned, or administrative actions will be initiated. (T-3) If 
administrative actions are initiated, the JTAC will be decertified IAW paragraph 4.12 
with a commander-directed downgrade to Q-3. 
4.11.  Decertification.  Any JTAC may be subject to Decertification for Cause for substandard 
performance in their JTAC responsibilities or Discretionary Decertification that is unrelated to the 
performance of their JTAC duties. 
4.11.1.  Decertification for Cause (with prejudice) is used for observed substandard 
performance as a JTAC. 
4.11.1.1.  This action is normally associated with a Commander-Directed Downgrade, but 
also applies to Commander-Directed Decertification of JTAC-Es for substandard 
performance. 4.11.1.2. Decertification is documented on an MFR signed by the unit 
commander. 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
23 
4.11.2.  Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice) is an administrative action that is not 
based upon performance as a JTAC. Discretionary Decertification is warranted when Uniform 
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) action is initiated, or any condition applies that prohibits 
personnel from performing JTAC duties IAW AFMAN 10-3505V1. The individual JTAC’s 
commander has the discretion to decertify or not. 
4.12.  Commander-Directed Downgrade.  Any commander (G-series orders) in a JTAC’s 
administrative chain of command may direct a Commander-Directed Downgrade. 
4.12.1.  A Commander-Directed Downgrade may be a downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific 
area/sub-area without disqualifying an individual. 
4.12.2.  A Commander-Directed Downgrade may direct a downgrade that either removes a 
qualification (e.g., JTAC-I or JTAC-E) or completely disqualifies an individual. 
4.12.3.  Downgrades may be directed without administering an evaluation using the following 
guidance: 
4.12.3.1.  Incidents related to JTAC safety that endanger personnel or equipment do not 
have to be directly observed by a JTAC-E but may be recommended by an examiner from 
any Mission Design Series (MDS)/aircrew specialty. 
4.12.3.2.  For incidents not related to JTAC safety do not use downgrades as a substitution 
for, or in lieu of, administrative, or judicial actions. Note: Consult with the supporting Staff 
Judge Advocate office for legal advice in these cases. Use in cases where such incidences 
directly affect the commander’s confidence in the JTAC’s ability to safely conduct CAS 
operations (e.g., lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the JTAC’s 
decision-making abilities within the MDS). 
4.12.4.  Any JTAC that has a qualification removed or was disqualified as a JTAC, JTAC-I, 
JTAC-E, or any combination thereof, will cease performing the disqualified duties effective 
from the date his or her commander initiated the downgrade. (T-1) 
4.12.5.  Commander-Directed Downgrade Documentation. Procedures for how to annotate a 
Commander-Directed Downgrade on AF Form 1035 can be found in AFMAN 10-3500V2, Air 
Force Special Warfare Standardization and Evaluation, Attachment 3. For procedures on 
documenting USSOCOM Form 43, refer to SOCOMM 350-5, SOF Conducting JTAC 
Training.

MASTER QUESTION FILE 
5.1.  Master Question File (MQF).  The MQF is a question bank used to construct closed book 
exams. It consists of pertinent questions designed to assess the knowledge of a JTAC regarding 
critical doctrine, operations, and safety. Air Combat Command Personnel Recovery Division 
(ACC/A3J) is responsible for ensuring that an applicable MQF database and questions are 
maintained to support this publication. The MQF database and related source materials will be 
accessible to all JTACs. (T-1) NOTE: The MQF is the JTAC Ground-Phase evaluation. 
5.1.1.  A minimum of 200 questions, covering every category on the JMTL will be maintained 
to ensure that at least four Ground-Phase evaluations can be built by the applicable Group 
JTAC-E-PMs (or equivalent) with no questions repeated across the four tests. (T-1) 
5.1.2.  Updates to the MQF. AF/A3S will conduct an annual review of the MQF, to be 
completed by 30 September, with assistance and inputs from all MQF users. (T-1) This does 
not relieve subordinate units from submitting required changes, as applicable, between review 
periods. 
5.1.2.1.  The review will focus on correcting erroneous questions, deleting outdated or 
invalid questions, and/or adding new questions to the database as a result to changes in 
applicable TTPs. (T-1) 
5.1.2.2.  MAJCOMs will forward their suggested changes to AF/A3S. (T-1) AF/A3S will 
coordinate and adjudicate all MAJCOM inputs, and then direct ACC/A3J to publish an 
updated MQF within 30 days of the end of the review process. (T-1) 
5.2.  Examination Requirements.  Each exam will consist of 50 multiple-choice questions. (T-1) 
5.2.1.  Security. Only JTAC-Es and individuals designated by the commander will administer 
examinations. (T-3) The JTAC-E-PM will maintain strict control of all examinations and 
answer keys by securing them in a locked container and/or password protected digital medium. 
(T-3) 
5.2.2.  Construction of Questions. Questions must measure the correct information at the 
desired level of knowledge. (T-1) 
5.2.2.1.  Each question included in the MQF must include the correct answer and include 
the reference, paragraph, and page number for the subject matter. (T-1) 
5.2.2.2.  Questions will be multiple choice (four choices desired with only one most correct 
answer). (T-1) 
5.2.2.3.  Questions that have numerical answers will have the answers arranged in order 
from largest to smallest or vice versa. (T-1) 
5.2.2.4.  In general, questions should avoid negative statements. However, if the word 
“not” appears in the question, underline it or type it in all capital letters for attention. (T-1) 
 
 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023

5.3.  MQF Classification Guidelines.  Although the desire is to maintain an unclassified MQF 
database, the overall classification of the MQF databases is determined by the highest 
classification of its contents. Whether they contain classified questions or not, Stan/Eval personnel 
will handle the examinations as controlled items. (T-1)

Chapter 6 
JTAC EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION 
6.1.  Purpose of JTAC Evaluation Documentation.  To properly document accomplishment of 
JTAC certification and qualification requirements, units will build and maintain a JTAC training 
and evaluation folder for each JTAC IAW AFMAN 10-3505V1 and the JTAC MOA. (T-1) This 
folder will hold all records dealing with an individual’s JTAC training and evaluation history IAW 
AFMAN 10-3505V1 and the JTAC MOA. (T-1) JTAC training and evaluation folders may be 
maintained in paper or digital format. If in a digital format, the JTAC training and evaluation folder 
will be maintained at all times in a MAJCOM-approved system of record. (T-1) 
6.2.  Description of Folders.  See AFMAN 10-3505V1 for folder description of parts I-IV and 
VI. 
6.2.1.  Part V. DOCUMENTATION OF EVALUATIONS. This part, sub-divided into three 
sections, contains documentation of all evaluations conducted since initial qualification. The 
JTAC-E-PM will provide a memorandum for record for all missing evaluation records. (T-1) 
6.2.1.1.  Unit Stan/Eval sections will ensure that an individual’s AF Form 942 and 
documentation of all evaluations conducted since initial certification are placed in Part V 
of the JTAC’s training and evaluation folder. (T-1) 
6.2.1.2.  Section 1. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 will be used as 
a record of evaluations and annual reviews throughout a JTAC’s career, with the most 
current on top and the minor discrepancy logs beneath the AF Form 942. See Attachment 
3 for properly formatting AF Form 942. (T-1) 
6.2.1.2.1.  Major Discrepancies Disposition. Major discrepancies are those that affect 
the qualification of the affected member. They will be documented on a permanent 
MFR filed in evaluation section immediately above the affected AF Form 1035 (T-1). 
An MFR created to document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from 
the evaluation section once the information is incorporated onto the completed, affected 
AF Form 1035 under Remarks. 
6.2.1.2.2.  Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are those that do not 
affect the qualification of the affected member and are corrected in accordance with 
AFMAN 10-3500V2. Typos, formatting and misspellings that do not affect the overall 
clarity of the document are not considered minor discrepancies. 
6.2.1.3.  Section 2. AF Form 1035/USSOCOM Form 43. Place the most current form on 
top. (T-1) Any memorandum for record that pertains to a specific assessment/evaluation 
will be placed directly on top of that AF Form 1035/USSOCOM Form 43. (T-1) 
Assessment or evaluation discrepancies (those that affect JTAC certification/qualification) 
will be corrected and documented with a Memorandum for Record. (T-1) Instructions for 
filling out the AF Form 1035 can be found in AFMAN 10-3500V2. Instructions for filling 
out USSOCOM Form 43 can be found in USSOCOM Manual 350-5. 
6.2.1.4.  Section 3. Memorandums for Record not related to a specific AF Form 
1035/USSOCOM Form 43. File the documents in chronological order, with the most recent 
on top. (T-1) 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023

STANDARDIZATION/EVALUATION BOARD AND TREND ANALYSIS PROGRAM 
7.1.  Standardization/Evaluation Board (SEB).  The unit commander, or their designated 
representative, will chair a semi-annual SEB. (T-1) At a minimum, the following members’ 
attendance is required: Director of Operations, Operations Superintendent, JTAC-E-PM, CW&T, 
and JTAC-PM. (T-3) Attachment 4 identifies the format for the SEB minutes. 
7.1.1.  The JTAC-E-PM (or commander-designated representative) will coordinate the 
schedule, agenda, and attendees for the semi-annual SEB. (T-3) The SEB minutes will be sent 
to the next HHQ no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the SEB. (T-1) 
7.1.2.  Groups will consolidate unit SEB minutes to determine any Group-wide trends. (T-1) 
7.1.3.  HHQ should review Group minutes and provide data to the Group’s parent MAJCOM. 
(T-1) 
7.2.  Trend Analysis Program.  Stan/Eval organizations at the unit level will establish a Trends 
Analysis Program. Unit commanders are the final authority for establishing what constitutes a unit 
trend. (T-1) 
7.2.1.  The unit will establish specific trend analysis threshold percentages and procedures. The 
Trend Analysis Program will include an objective analysis of all JTAC evaluations, written 
examinations, and any deficiencies/items of interest observed during exercises and 
contingencies such as Green Flag. (T-1) Unit JTAC-E-PMs will report any negative trend data, 
recommend corrective actions, assign an OPR/office of collateral responsibility (OCR), and 
report trend status to the SEB. (T-1) 
7.2.2.  The trend program is the commander’s program, and the commander will determine 
which trends to track, evaluate, correct, and close, and for how long. (T-2) 
7.2.3.  Trend data will be included in the SEB minutes and follow-up actions will be addressed 
at the subsequent SEBs until the discrepancies are corrected/closed. The JTAC-E-PM must 
maintain the trend analysis data collected from the date of the last unit inspection until another 
unit inspection is conducted or for a period of 18 months. (T-2) 
7.2.3.1.  For written examination trends, consider the validity of the question, the structure 
of the distractor answers, and the need for and/or appropriateness of increased emphasis in 
the question’s subject area. (T-2) 
7.2.3.2.  For MSN evaluation trends, calculate the percentage of “Q”, “Q-” and “U” grades 
against the total number of evaluations given in the sub-area. (T-1) Trends are not always 
identified by a threshold percentage but may be determined by the commander’s 
assessment as a potential area of weakness.

SEI, a JTAC remains certified permanently unless the certification is lost for cause. 
Close Air Support (CAS)—Air action by fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile targets 
that are in close proximity to friendly forces and requires detailed integration of each air mission 
with the fire and movement of those forces. (JP 3-09.3). 
Control—Consists of at least one simulated, dry or live aircraft (fixed/rotary wing) attacking a 
surface target. The control should follow the CAS execution template IAW JP 3-09.3 and NATO 
ATP 3.3.2.2. An actual weapons release is not required. No more than two controls (lead aircraft 
and wingman) can be counted per CAS briefing per target. 
Debriefed—Remedial action taken by an evaluator to correct a discrepancy noted during a JTAC 
evaluation. This action is accomplished during debrief of the evaluation wherein the evaluator 
provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy and determines that the JTAC has gained 
the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy said discrepancy. The discrepancy area/sub-
area description is annotated with “Debriefed” in the “Remarks” section of the AF Form 1035. 
Dry Terminal Attack Control—Dry terminal attack control is control of aircraft where no air-
to-ground munitions (live, inert, or training ordnance) are released from the aircraft. 
Eligibility Period—The six-month period prior to the expiration date of a JTAC certification 
during which all Ground-Phase and MSN evaluation requirements for the recurring qualification 
evaluation must be completed. 
Evaluation—This includes the Ground-Phase and MSN evaluation used to determine 
qualification as a JTAC as prescribed by governing directives. 
Forward Air Controller—A specifically trained and qualified aviation officer who exercises 
control from the air of aircraft engaged in close air support of ground troops. The FAC(A) is 
normally an airborne extension of the Tactical Air Control Party (JP

AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP)—Comprised of four annexes that 
contain decisions by Secretary of Defense to allocate forces and is published by the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Directs the Joint force providers to publish an annexed schedule that 
serves as the deployment order directing force providers to deploy forces at the specified dates. 
Also allows force providers some leeway in determining which unit will deploy and on the ordered 
latest arrival dates that the force provider must deploy to account for realities, such as time-phased 
force and deployment data refinement, based on transportation analysis or minor operational 
adjustments by the combatant commander (CCDR), and based on operational necessities. 
Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)—A qualified (certified) Service member who, from 
a forward position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in close air support and other 
offensive air operations (JP 3-09.3). 
Joint Terminal Attack Controller-Evaluator (JTAC-E)—The JTAC-E is a qualified JTAC who 
has completed an Initial JTAC-E Evaluation successfully and is designated to perform evaluation 
duties as specified by this manual. JTAC-Es must be qualified in the position they are evaluating. 
JTAC-Es are trained and certified to administer JTAC evaluations at the direction of the JTAC-E-
PM. 
Joint Terminal Attack Controller-Instructor (JTAC-I)—A qualified individual recommended 
by the unit Chief of Weapons and Tactics and designated by the unit commander who provides 
training to unit JTACs. Responsible for implementing JTAC training per AFI 10-35-TACPV1 and 
developed by the unit’s Chief, Weapons and Tactics. 
JTAC Initial Certification Training (JTAC-ICT)—A formal training process consisting of an 
accredited JTAC Schoolhouse Course designed to initially certify a JTAC in terminal control 
duties without regards to the unit’s operational mission. 
JTAC Mission Qualification Training (JTAC MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic 
level of competence in JTAC requirements and in a unit’s primary tasked missions. 
JTAC-E Evaluation—An evaluation administered by the JTAC-E-PM, or a higher headquarters 
JTAC-E-PM or JTAC-E, to determine a unit JTAC-E’s ability to perform their duties. 
Documentation on the qualification of a JTAC-E is accomplished using AF Form 942 and AF 
Form 1035. Upon successful completion of the JTAC-E Evaluation, the commander appoints a 
JTAC-E by a formal letter of appointment. 
Live Terminal Attack Control—Live terminal attack control is control of aircraft where air-to-
ground munitions (live, inert, or training ordnance) are released from the aircraft. 
Major Discrepancy—A discrepancy with an AF Form 1035 that changes the qualification level 
assigned by the AF Form 1035. 
Master Question File (MQF)—A headquarters-designated, OPR (i.e., MAJCOM) developed 
database of Stan/Eval program related multiple choice questions derived from mission area 
publications. Stan/Eval functions use the MQF in constructing examinations that this manual 
requires. All JTACs have access to the MQF. 
Minor Discrepancy—A discrepancy on an AF Form 1035 that is erroneous but does not affect 
the qualification level assigned on the AF Form 1035. 
 
 
AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023

Mission Evaluation—A field evaluation involving all elements for requesting coordinating and 
controlling airborne weapon systems employed during terminal attacks (i.e., CAS mission). These 
JTAC evaluations allow commanders to assess personnel, who in the performance of their duties, 
exercise judgment or execute decisions to prevent putting themselves and others at great hazard, 
i.e., clearance to release ordnance. Term replaces what was previously known as the Control Phase. 
No-Notice Evaluation—Give this evaluation at such time that preparation, beyond that which is 
normally accomplished for the mission, is not possible. These evaluations may be a complete 
qualification evaluation, a written examination only, or an evaluation covering only selected areas. 
Precision Strike—The full kinetic and non-kinetic potential of ground, air, space, and cyber 
power to successfully find, fix, and bring effects against an objective or capability. 
Qualification Training—Training required to maintain duty position qualification and 
proficiency. 
Qualified (JTAC)—A certified JTAC who completes the established minimum recurring training 
IAW AFMAN 10-3505V1, Table A5.1 and evaluation requirements. 
Re-examination—This is the re-accomplishment of a required written examination following a 
failure. 
Re-qualification (RQ) Evaluation—An evaluation administered to regain JTAC qualification 
after a loss of qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation or a failed JTAC 
evaluation. 
Scenario—A document or set of documents that describes the tactics employed while simulating 
the unit’s mission in support of the GFMAP and DOC statement. 
Simulated Terminal Attack Control—Simulated terminal attack control is control of virtual 
aircraft in an electronically generated environment. 
Special Interest Item—This is an operational subject area of concern designated by the higher 
headquarters commander and staff for evaluation and used to focus units on specific areas of 
concern. 
Spot Evaluation—An additional commander’s evaluation tool. Commanders direct this 
qualification evaluation outside the eligibility period to ensure correction of identified 
discrepancies or to check an individual's proficiency. A spot evaluation is normally limited in 
scope. It may be either a field evaluation and/or a written examination. These evaluations may be 
either no-notice or with prior coordination. 
Supervised Status—The status of a JTAC who may only control under the supervision of a 
qualified JTAC. 
Task Evaluation—A task evaluation is the completion of a task under the supervision of a trainer 
to certify the member is capable of performing the task to a Go/No-Go standard. 
Terminal Attack Control—A control consists of at least one aircraft attacking a surface target. 
The control begins with a CAS briefing from a JTAC and ends with either an actual/simulated 
weapons release or an abort on a final attack run. No more than two controls may be counted per 
CAS briefing per target.

AFMAN10-3505V2  7 NOVEMBER 2023 
Trend Analysis Program—Formal analysis program established to identify areas requiring 
attention, monitoring, or correction. 
Unit—Any military element whose structure is prescribed by competent authority (JP 3-33). For 
the Air Force, a unit is defined as a group, squadron or detachment. It also refers to any operations 
section that is required to establish its own JTAC Stan/Eval program. 
Unqualified (JTAC)—Individuals are placed in “unqualified” status after failing to complete 
training or qualification requirements within the allotted training cycle or has failed to meet 
evaluation requirements outlined in this publication. “Unqualified” is a status for when a JTAC is 
not permitted to control aircraft unsupervised. 
Note—Even when an individual is placed in “Unqualified” status, the JTAC remains a “certified” 
JTAC. 
Written Examinations—Written examinations required for satisfactory completion of the 
Ground-Phase evaluation. Examination will be drawn from the MAJCOM Master Question File 
(MQF). MAJCOM supplements may specify additional written examinations, such as rules of 
engagement, etc.
