AFI17-101_DAFGM2024-01  5 September 2024 
 
 
(MODIFY) 4.1. Overview. The 7-Step RMF process is based on the process outlined in NIST 
SP 800-37r2 and DoDI 8510.01 and is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Where possible, this Instruction 
also identifies steps required for the “Assess Only” (see Chapter 5) process. This process is 
iterative throughout the entire lifecycle for IT IAW DoDI 5000.02, and the DoD Program 
Manager’s Guidebook for Integrating the Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) 
into the System Acquisition Lifecycle (DoD PM Guidebook). 
 
(MODIFY) 4.3.1. Begin this step by completing the DAF ITCSC and DD Form 2930. During 
this process, the impact of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is categorized into one of 
three designations (low, moderate, or high) to address the impact of a potential loss of data.  
 
(MODIFY) 4.3.2. If the program’s primary mission is not represented on the form’s 
authorization boundary list, the PM or ISO will check “Other” on the ITCSC and submit the 
document to the DAFRMC for disposition; send to SAF/CNZR Cybersecurity Division, 
SAF.CNZR.CNZR.Workflow@us.af.mil. 
 
(MODIFY) 4.3.3. IAW AFI 17-110, the Program Manager / Project Manager must register the 
IT in DAF IT Investment Portfolio Suite (ITIPS), as the governance tool for the DAF CIO, with 
the exception of those identified by other policy (i.e., special access programs, space, nuclear 
command, control, and communication, Joint) to be registered in another repository. (T-2) 
 
(MODIFY) 4.3.5. The dual-signed ITCSC will be posted to ITIPS as an artifact upon initial 
registration or when a substantial modification or update is planned or completed. The dual-
signed ITCSC documents PM and AO concurrence on RMF CATEGORIZE and SELECT 
elements. (T-1) 
 
(MODIFY) 4.4. SELECT Security Controls. References DoDI 8510.01, CNSSI No.1253, 
NIST SP 800-30, NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 (800-53r5), and the DoD and DAF RMF KS 
(OPR: PM / ISO). 
 
(MODIFY) 4.4.1. The process for selection of security controls is documented at DoDI 8510.01. 
(Users are advised to consult the DoD and DAF RMF KS, and / or the DAF SAP Cybersecurity 
Office milSuite website located at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/usaf-cybersecurity-
for-sap/overview until static references are updated). 
 
(MODIFY) 4.4.2.2. Air Combat Command, the DAF Enterprise AO and common control 
provider, provides Tier 2 Common Controls (Inheritance) available in eMASS for DAF IT use. 
 
(MODIFY) 4.4.5. Tailor controls as required. Every selected control must be accounted for by 
one of the following: the organization, ISO, or PM / ISSM. If a control is added or de-selected 
from the baseline (i.e., tagged as not applicable), then a risk-based rationale must be documented 
in the security plan and POA&M. Note: Special Access Programs must consult the Joint Special 
Access Program (SAP) Implementation Guide (JSIG) located in the RMF Policy and Guidance 
section at 
AFI17-101_DAFGM2024-01  5 September 2024 
 
https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/69/documents/io/rmf/JSIG_2016April11_Final_(53Rev4).pdf 
to determine and manage non-tailorable controls. 
 
(MODIFY) 4.5. IMPLEMENT Security Controls. References DoDI 8510.01, NIST SP 800-
53r5, applicable security technical implementation guides, security requirements guides, the 
DAF ORTB, and the DoD and DAF RMF KS. (OPR: ISO / PM). 
 
(ADD) 4.5.1. The DAF ORTB is an organizational tool that provides scoping considerations 
such as prioritization and importance, and introduces the order in which security controls or 
control enhancements are to be implemented. Areas of consideration for the DAF ORTB include 
policy / regulatory, technology, physical infrastructure, system component allocation, operational 
/ environmental, public access, scalability, common control, and security objective.  
 
(ADD) 4.5.2. Control implementation focuses on identifying and managing the most critical IT 
risks as early in the process as possible. The ORTB leverages the Control Criticality Rating 
schemes in eMASS to facilitate and provide visibility of this requirement and establish an 
implementation order. 
 
(ADD) 4.5.3. Every selected control must be accounted for by one of the following: the 
organization, ISO, or PM / ISSM. If a selected control is not implemented, then the rationale for 
not implementing the controls must be documented in the security plan and POA&M. (T-1) 
 
(MODIFY) 4.7. AUTHORIZE System. After reviewing the security authorization 
documentation, the AO or Subordinate AO formally accepts or rejects risk by authorizing the IT 
through an interim authority to test (IATT), authorization to operate (ATO), or a denial of 
authorization to operate (DATO). (OPR: AO / Subordinate AO). 
 
(ADD) 4.7.2.5. For SAP systems, AOs ensure ISSMs, ISOs, and PMs follow amplifying 
guidance contained in the most current Risk Posture Guidance for DAF SAP Information 
Technology (IT) letter located at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/docs/DOC-662288.  
 
(MODIFY) 4.8. Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO). 
 
(MODIFY) 4.8.1. If risk is determined to be unacceptable when compared to the mission 
assurance requirement, the AO or Subordinate AO, in collaboration with all program 
stakeholders, will issue a DATO. If the system is already operational, the responsible AO will 
issue a DATO and operation of the system will cease immediately. Network connections will be 
immediately terminated for any system that is issued a DATO. (T-0) 
 
(MODIFY) 4.8.2. Upon issuing the DATO, the AO will provide a copy of the issued document 
to SAF/CN via email: SAF.CNZR.CNZR.Workflow@us.af.mil. (T-1) 
 
(DELETE) 4.10.2. Air Force Information Assurance Platform Information Technology (PIT) 
Guidebook. The PIT Guidebook provides clarity on the information cybersecurity activities 
required for all PIT. This includes weapon systems, medical systems, industrial control systems, 
armament systems, test systems, etc., that qualify as PIT. The Guidebook should be used to 
AFI17-101_DAFGM2024-01  5 September 2024 
 
develop local procedures, as enhancement to RMF for PIT that correspond with the product 
being developed or procured. The Guidebook suggests best practices to be followed in ensuring 
cybersecurity is “built-in” to the product, but allows local variations. The primary use of the 
Guidebook is for acquisition of new PIT and to provide guidance on applicability of the RMF to 
legacy PIT. 
 
(ADD) 4.10.10. Cybersecurity professionals will use the Joint Special Program Implementation 
Guide (JSIG), located in the RMF Policy and Guidance section at 
https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/69/documents/io/rmf/JSIG_2016April11_Final_(53Rev4).pdf 
for enhanced cybersecurity configurations and processes.

Chapter 1 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
1.1.  Purpose.  This AFI provides implementation instructions for the implementation of the Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) methodology for Air Force (AF) Information Technology (IT) in 
accordance with AFPD 17-1, and AFI 17-130, Air Force Cybersecurity Program Management. 
1.1.1.  The RMF incorporates strategy, policy, awareness/training, assessment, continuous 
monitoring, authorization, implementation, and remediation. 
1.1.2.  The RMF aligns with Secretary of the Air Force/ Deputy Chief Information Officer 
(SAF/CN) strategic goals and objectives key concept of cybersecurity that works which 
requires robust risk assessment and management. 
1.1.3.  The RMF process encompasses life cycle risk management to determine and manage 
the residual cybersecurity risk to the AF created by the vulnerabilities and threats associated 
with objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations. 
1.1.4.  Privacy and security controls are implemented based on the assessed and mitigated 
residual risk. The controls align with Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01, Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT) and are documented in 
the RMF security authorization package for AF IT. 
Figure 1.1.  Air Force IT Categories.

AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
1.2.  Applicability. 
1.2.1.  This includes IT supporting research, development, test and evaluation (T&E), and 
DoD-controlled IT operated by a contractor or other entity on behalf of the DoD. AF IT (see 
Figure 1.1) includes but is not limited to: information systems (major applications and 
enclaves), platform information technology (PIT) (PIT systems, PIT subsystems, and PIT 
products), IT services (internal & external), IT products (software, hardware, and applications) 
and boundary requirements for assess and authorize and assess only (see Chapter 5). 
1.2.2.  Risk management authorities for special access programs rest with SAF/CN and are 
executed via this instruction unless higher level guidance exists, in which case compliance will 
default to the more restrictive policies and directives. The responsible office in support of 
special access programs IT risk management is the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary 
of the Air Force and Air Force Senior Security Official (SAF/AA). 
1.2.3.  This AFI does not apply to the protection of sensitive compartmented information 
systems (IS) or intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance mission and mission support 
systems. 
1.2.4.  Authority for AF space systems rests with AF Space Command as delegated by United 
States Strategic Command. AF space systems follow AF cybersecurity policy and processes; 
where exceptions exist, this Instruction is annotated accordingly. NOTE: Space systems 
supporting more than one DoD Component will follow cybersecurity policy and guidance in 
DoDI 8581.01, Information Assurance (IA) Policy for Space Systems Used by the Department 
of Defense. 
1.2.5.  For IT not centrally managed or that has yet to be assigned an authorizing official (AO), 
the unit responsible for ownership or operation of the IT shall assign duties for the minimum 
RMF relevant roles (see Table 3.1) required to comply with RMF. The duties shall include the 
roles and responsibilities for reporting, oversight, and risk management to the AF. 
1.3.  Objectives. 
1.3.1.  The RMF provides a disciplined and structured process to perform AF IT security and 
risk management activities and to integrate those activities into the system development life 
cycle. The RMF is a dynamic approach to risk management that effectively manages mission 
and cybersecurity risks in a diverse environment of complex, evolving, and sophisticated cyber 
threats and vulnerabilities. 
1.3.2.  The RMF ensures AF IT assets are assessed for cybersecurity risk. Discovered 
weaknesses are documented in a plan of action and milestones (POA&M) to mitigate residual 
risk. An AO, identified at Table 3.1, who is supported by an RMF team, accepts the risk for 
his/her area of responsibility, in accordance with DoDI 8510.01, and the Air Force RMF 
Knowledge Service (See Resources and Tools).

3.18.  Cybersecurity Forums.  The AF leverages existing DoD and AF governance bodies (e.g., 
Air Force Security Enterprise Executive Board, Information Technology Governance Executive 
Board) to discuss cybersecurity risk topics and make organizational and mission area risk 
decisions. The following forums and online resources provide focused management and oversight 
of the AF Cybersecurity Program. 
3.18.1.  Air Force Cybersecurity Technical Advisory Group. The AF Cybersecurity Technical 
Advisory Group provides technical cybersecurity subject matter experts from across the 
MAJCOMs and functional communities to facilitate the management, oversight, and execution 
of the AF Cybersecurity Program. The AF Cybersecurity Technical Advisory Group examines 
cybersecurity-related issues common across AF entities and provides recommendations to the 
CISO and Defense Information Assurance Security Accreditation Working Group on changes 
to the minimally required security and privacy controls (for Air Force Information Network 
connection) or configurations. 
3.18.2.  Air Force Risk Management Council (AFRMC). The Air Force Risk Management 
Council (AFRMC) provides a forum for the senior cybersecurity professionals to discuss issues 
concerning cybersecurity risk from a mission and business perspective. The council reviews 
proposed Mission Area or AF RMF control overlays, and RMF guidance. The council 
standardizes the cybersecurity implementation processes for both the acquisition and lifecycle 
operations for IT. The Air Force Risk Management Council advises and makes 
recommendations to existing governance bodies. Finally, the Air Force Risk Management 
Council recommends assignment of IT to the appropriate AO for systems that fall outside of 
all defined authorization boundaries. 
3.18.3.  AF AO Summit. The AO Summit is not a governance body but rather an enabler for 
both an enterprise-wide and converged organizational perspective to cybersecurity policy 
development, oversight, implementation, and training. This venue provides the SAF/CN and 
AOs an opportunity to discuss issues relevant to the RMF, AO Boundaries, IT, AOs, and SCAs.

RMF METHODOLOGY 
4.1.  Overview.   The 7-Step RMF process at is based on the process outlined in NIST SP 800-
37r2 and DoDI 8510.01 and is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Where possible, this Instruction also 
identifies steps required for the “Assess Only” (see Chapter 5) process. This process is iterative 
throughout the entire lifecycle for IT IAW DoDI 5000.02 and the DoD Program Manager’s 
Guidebook for Integrating the Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) into the System 
Acquisition Lifecycle (DoD PM Guidebook). 
4.1.1.  The DoD RMF KS (https://rmfks.osd.mil/rmf/Pages/default.aspx) is the 
authoritative source for RMF implementation, planning, and execution. 
4.1.2.  This chapter highlights the AF-specific implementation, key AF roles in each step, and 
additional resources required to complete the process. This instruction is intended to be a 
companion to the DoD implementation instructions. 
Figure 4.1.  RMF for AF IT. 
 
4.2.  PREPARE.  References CNSSI No.4009, NIST SP 800-37r2, and the DoD and AF RMF KS 
(OPR: PM/ISO). The purpose of Prepare step of the RMF is to identify essential activities of 
organization, mission and business processes. The program manager/ RMF team is required to fill 
out the ITCSC during this step to identify and prepare for the management of cybersecurity and 
privacy risks.

Categories, and the DoD and AF RMF KS (OPR: PM/ISO). 
4.3.1.  Begin this step by completing the RMF ITCSC and DD Form 2930. During this process, 
the impact of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is categorized into one of three 
designations (low, moderate, or high) to address the impact of a potential loss of data. 
4.3.2.  If the program’s primary mission is not represented on the form’s authorization 
boundary list, the PM or ISO will check “other” on the ITCSC and submit the completed 
document to the AF risk Management Council for disposition; send to SAF/CNZR 
Cybersecurity Division, usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6zr-workflow@mail.mil. 
4.3.3.  All AF IT, IAW AFI 17-110, the Program Manager/ Project Manager must register the 
IT in AF IT Investment Portfolio Suite (ITIPS), as the governance tool for the AF CIO, with 
the exception of those identified by other policy (i.e., space, nuclear command, control, and 
communication, Joint) to be registered in another repository. (T-3) 
4.3.4.  ITIPS will systematically assign a temporary registration number for each registered IT 
until the next scheduled replication with DoD Information Technology Portfolio Repository. 
A DoD Information Technology Portfolio Repository number will then be systematically 
assigned, and included in ITIPS as the permanent official IT registration number for all 
registered AF IT. 
4.3.5.  The dual signed ITCSC will be posted to ITIPS an artifact upon initial registration or 
when a substantial modification or update is planned or completed. The dual signed ITCSC 
documents PM and AO concurrence on RMF CATEGORIZE and SELECT elements. (T-3) 
NOTE: Posting of the ITCSC in eMASS is encouraged, but not required. 
4.3.6.  All AF IT will be registered in the appropriate eMASS instance: NIPRNet; SIPRNet; 
DoD Special Access Programs; or Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System. (T-
1) 
4.3.7.  The organization’s eMASS Account Manager/ Organizational System Administrator 
(See Resources and Tools) grants access to eMASS and grants required permissions based on 
duties and responsibilities. A listing of Account Managers for the AF organizations can be 
found on the AF RMF KS. 
4.3.8.  The minimum set of documentation required in support of an RMF authorization 
decision is the security authorization package and consists of:

Security 
Technical 
Implementation Guide, Security Requirements Guides, and the DoD and AF RMF KS. Use DoDI 
8510.01, enclosure 6 instructions for details for assessing security controls (OPR: SCA). 
4.7.  AUTHORIZE System.  After reviewing the security authorization documentation, the AO 
formally accepts or rejects risk by authorizing the IT through an interim authority to test, 
authorization to operate, authorization to operate with conditions, or a denial of authorization to 
operate. References DoDI 8510.01, enclosure 6 (OPR: AO/AODR). 
4.7.1.  AOs will issue an interim authority to test, authorization to operate, or an authorization 
to operate with conditions for any risk determined not to be “Very High” or “High”. (T-0) 
4.7.2.  Authorization to operate with conditions for unmitigated “Very High” or “High” risk. 
4.7.2.1.  The SAF/CN is the only Air Force authority that may grant an AO the approval to 
issue an Authorization to Operate (ATO) with “Very High” or “High” risk/ (formerly 
known as CAT I) non-compliant security controls that cannot be corrected or mitigated 
immediately, but where the overall risk is acceptable due to mission criticality. Delegation 
below the SAF/CN is not authorized. IT with “Very High” or “High” risk, which are 
authorized by other DoD Components connecting to the AF information networks require 
Component CIO approval, and  a joint systems requires DoD CIO approval. 
4.7.2.2.  IT with unmitigated “Very High” or “High” risk non-compliant security controls 
must follow the Very High/High Package Submission Guide requiring the Authorizing 
Official to submit completed packages to the SAF/CN for approval prior to making an 
authorization decision. (T-0) 
4.7.2.3.  For “Very High” or “High” risk authorizations, the authorization to operate with 
conditions will be issued for up to 1 year. When a 1-year authorization to operate with 
conditions is issued, the authorization to operate with conditions must specify a review 
period that is within 6 months of the authorization termination date (ATD). (T-1) 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
23 
4.7.2.4.  If the system still requires operation with a level of risk of “Very High” or “High” 
after 1 year, the AF CIO must again grant permission for continued operation of the system. 
(T-0) 
4.8.  Denial of Authorization to Operate. 
4.8.1.  If risk is determined to be unacceptable when compared to the mission assurance 
requirement, the authorizing official, in collaboration with all program stakeholders, will issue 
a denial of authorization to operate. If the system is already operational, the responsible AO 
will issue a denial of authorization to operate and operation of the system will cease 
immediately. Network connections will be immediately terminated for any system that is 
issued a denial of authorization to operate. (T-0) 
4.8.2.  Upon issuing the denial of authorization to operate, the AO will provide a copy of the 
issued document to SAF/CN via usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6zr-workflow@mail.mil. 
4.9.  MONITOR Security Controls.  References DoDI 8510.01 and NIST SP 800-137, 
Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and 
Organizations (OPR: PM/ISO and ISSM). 
4.9.1.  DoDI 8510.01 and the DoD RMF KS for Continuous Monitoring provides a detailed 
framework on continuous monitoring, which should be used to augment the continuous 
monitoring program for the IT. 
4.9.2.  The objective of an Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program is to 
determine if the complete set of planned, required, and deployed security controls within a 
system or inherited by the system continue to be effective over time in light of inevitable 
changes. 
4.9.3.  Documenting proposed or actual changes to a system or its environment of operation 
and subsequently assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the security state 
of the system or the organization is an important aspect of security control monitoring. 
4.9.4.  All implemented security controls, including management and operational controls, 
must be regularly assessed for effectiveness, even if monitoring them is not easily automated. 
4.9.5.  Authorizing Officials must consider how ISCM will be implemented organization-wide 
as one of the key components of the security life cycle represented by the RMF. 
4.9.6.  Individual system-level ISCM strategies must align with the organization’s broader 
ISCM strategy. 
4.9.7.  Note:  If the change results in a new “Very High” or “High” risk non-compliant security 
control(s) that can be corrected within 30 days or a new Moderate risk that can be 
corrected/satisfactorily mitigated within 90 days, the system can continue to operate under the 
existing authorization decision and connection approval as referenced in DoDI 8510.01. 
4.10.  Resources and Tools. 
4.10.1.  DoD PM Guidebook. The DoD Program Manager's Guidebook for Integrating the 
Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) into the System Acquisition Lifecycle.  
The DoD PM Guidebook supports the policies in this AFI by providing specific procedures 
and is capable of implementing changes as industry and policy dictate.

AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
4.10.2.  Air Force Information Assurance Platform Information Technology (PIT) Guidebook. 
The PIT Guidebook provides clarity on the information cybersecurity activities required for all 
PIT. This includes weapon systems, medical systems, industrial control systems, armament 
systems, test systems, etc., that qualify as PIT. The Guidebook should be used to develop local 
procedures, as enhancement to RMF for PIT that correspond with the product being developed 
or procured. The Guidebook suggests best practices to be followed in ensuring cybersecurity 
is “built-in” to the product, but allows local variations. The primary use of the Guidebook is 
for acquisition of new PIT and to provide guidance on applicability of the RMF to legacy PIT. 
4.10.3.  Agent of the Security Control Assessor Licensing Guide. The number and complexity 
of AF IT may require the AF agent of the security control assessor to designate qualified 
entities as agent of the security control assessor to perform assessment actions. The AF SCA 
created the ASCA Licensing Guide to appoint licensed, qualified agents to provide accurate, 
consistent, and trusted AF and Space IT assessments. 
4.10.4.  Air Force Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M) Guidebook. 
4.10.4.1.  The IT security POA&M is a document that identifies tasks needing to be 
accomplished. It details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan, any 
milestones in meeting the tasks, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones. For 
further POA&M information, refer to the Air Force POA&M Guidebook.

Chapter 5 
AF IT ASSESS ONLY REQUIREMENTS 
5.1.  PIT Subsystems, PIT Products, IT Services, and IT Products.  IT categorized below the 
system level will not require an authorization decision. This IT will follow the Assess Only 
process. The IT below the system level must be securely configured (in accordance with applicable 
DoD policies and security controls), documented in an assessment package, and reviewed by the 
responsible ISSM, under the direction of the AO, for acceptance or connection into an authorized 
IS or PIT System. (T-1) 
5.1.1.  PIT. The PIT system owner (i.e., ISO) may determine that a collection of PIT rises to 
the level of a PIT System with the AO’s approval. The ISSM (with the review and approval of 
the AO) is responsible for ensuring all PIT completes the appropriate RMF processes prior to 
incorporation into or connection to a system or enclave. PIT may be categorized using CNSSI 
No. 1253 with the resultant security control baselines tailored as needed. Otherwise, the 
specific cybersecurity needs of PIT must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and security 
controls applied as appropriate. 
5.1.2.  IT Services. Organizations that use internal IT services will complete the ITCSC to 
ensure the categorization of the system delivering the service is appropriate to the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs of the information and mission. (T-1) 
5.1.3.  Organizations that use external IT services provided by a non-DoD federal government 
agency, except cloud services, must ensure the categorization of the system delivering the 
service is appropriate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs of the information 
and mission, and that the system delivering the service is operating under a current 
authorization from that agency. (T-2) 
5.1.4.  Organizations contracting for external IT services in the form of commercial cloud 
computing services must comply with the DoD Cloud Computing Security Requirements 
Guide and applicable procedural guidance. (T-0) 
5.1.5.  IT Products. The system administrator will configure IT products in accordance with 
applicable security technical implementation guides under a cognizant ISSM and SCA. (T-1) 
security technical implementation guides are product specific and document applicable DoD 
policies and security requirements, as well as best practices and configuration guidelines. 
When a Security Technical Implementation Guide is not available for a product, a Security 
Requirements Guide will be used as applicable. (T-1) 
5.1.6.  IT Product, Software, and Application Certification Assessment. ISSMs have the 
responsibility to exercise due diligence on IT product software and applications (software 
products) that reside on their enclave/system. At a minimum, software products will be 
assessed for supportability, operability, compatibility, and security to ensure the products 
present an acceptable risk to the AFIN. (T-1) This can be accomplished via the following 
methods: 
5.1.6.1.  Assess and Authorize. ISSM’s may incorporate software assessment and 
evaluation by integrating the Software Assessment Report into their system enclave’s 
security authorization package. Follow the guidance and use the template on the DoD RMF 
KS. 
26 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
5.1.6.2.  Air Force Software and Application Certification Assessment. Software products 
may be assessed through the AF Software and Application Certification Assessment 
process managed by the Air Force Network Integration Center. The Enterprise SCA then 
certifies software products for inclusion on the AF Evaluated Products List. Testing may 
be accomplished by the Cyberspace Capabilities Center or by the organization sponsoring 
the software product. Software products are certified for use on computers running the 
Standard Desktop Configuration or DoD Server Core Configuration, applications, and 
approved mobile devices on the AFIN. Instructions, templates, and the testing 
methodology are located on the Software Certification Assessment home page. 
5.1.6.2.1.  The wing ISSM and or the responsible AO will endorse and submit the 
application request worksheet. (T-3) 
5.1.6.2.2.  Once the Application Request Worksheet is accepted by the Cyberspace 
Capabilities Center, testing is accomplished by either the sponsor or Cyberspace 
Capabilities Center. The Authorizing Official or sponsor must ensure that the testing is 
conducted on an environment external to the operational network. (T-2) 
5.1.6.2.3.  If the IT product presents an acceptable risk (e.g., moderate or below) to the 
information system, the major version of the product will be certified for up to 3 years 
by the AF Enterprise SCA and placed on the AF Evaluated Products List by the 
Enterprise Authorizing Official.(T-1) This certification is not an ATO. The system or 
enclave ISSM must implement any required mitigations to reduce the risk before 
placing the software product within the system or enclave. The ISSM must update the 
applicable system or enclave assessment and authorization documentation and 
hardware/software lists to reflect any solutions implemented. (T-1) This update will be 
considered a “no security impact” modification to the system authorization. 
5.2.  Reciprocity.  For products not already assessed via the RMF or the AF software and 
application certification assessment process, the Enterprise AO allows ISSMs to use software 
products that are certified by another Federal/DoD AO or SCA. 
5.3.  Evaluated Products.  A list of recognized sources can be found on the AF RMF KS. These 
software products are considered assessed and require no additional formal test or evaluation, so 
long as the actual environment, use, and configuration aligns with the intended environment, use, 
and configuration documented in the assessment package. 
5.4.  Contingencies.  Compliance with this decision is contingent upon the following conditions: 
5.4.1.  The software product and major version is verified on one of the recognized sources. 
5.4.2.  Prior to implementation, the system/enclave ISSM must implement any required 
mitigations to reduce the security risk. (T-1) 
5.4.3.  The system/enclave ISSM must update their applicable RMF documentation and 
hardware/software lists to reflect any solutions implemented. This update will be considered a 
no security impact modification to the system authorization. (T-1) 
5.5.  Software Products Excluded from AF SACA.  The following software products must be 
submitted through the AF Enterprise AO processes. (T-2) 
5.5.1.  Products whose main function is encryption, but does not have Federal Information 
Processing Standard 140-2 certification. 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
27 
5.5.2.  Software that does not have a vendor or sponsor responsible for developing security 
patches. 
5.5.3.  Software with immitigable Moderate (CAT II) or higher vulnerabilities. 
5.5.4.  Software that uses ports, protocols, or services not listed in the DoD Category 
Assurance List. 
5.5.5.  Unsupported freeware and shareware. 
5.5.6.  Open source software with no configuration/software support plan. 
5.5.7.  IA or IA-enabled products/software IAW Committee on National Security Systems 
Policy No. 11, National Policy Governing the Acquisition of Information Assurance (IA) and 
IA-Enabled Information Technology Products.(T-2) 
5.5.8.  Additional information about the Air Force Assess Only process can be found in the Air 
Force Assess Only guide located on the AF RMF KS.

Chapter 6 
APPROVAL TO CONNECT (ATC) PROCESS 
6.1.  Overview.  The approval to connect Approval to Connect (ATC) process is one instance of 
the AF’s implementation of reciprocity between AOs. It is a formal evaluation of the risk of 
connecting systems to the receiving enclave; the ATC is a means to manage community risk. 
Having an ATO does not entitle systems to an ATC from the receiving AO. 
6.2.  Duration and Expiration.  In order for a system to request an ATC from a site or enclave, 
both the AF system and the destination enclave must have a valid and current authorization. The 
system ATC expiration date will be no later than the authorization termination date of the ATO 
for that system. For a system under continual reauthorization, the connection authorization must 
be reevaluated upon a significant system modification, significant change to the threat or risk 
posture, or every 3 years; whichever comes first. 
6.3.  Note:  Although this Instruction specifies the requirements for connections to the AF 
Information Networks, other AOs are encouraged to use this process to authorize connections to 
enclaves within their authorization (formerly accreditation) boundary 
6.4.  Connection to the DoD Information Network.  For enclaves requiring a circuit connection 
from Defense Information Systems Agency, ISSMs must follow the DoD Information Network 
Connection Process Guide to ensure all required artifacts are provided on initial submission. 
Connection requests will be coordinated through the AF Enterprise AO. 
6.5.  Connection to the Air Force Information Networks (AFIN).  The AF Enterprise AO is the 
only authority permitted to grant an ATC to the AFIN. ATC authorities for other AF appointed 
AO’s may be approved by SAF/CN in coordination with the Enterprise AO. 
6.5.1.  AF systems authorized through the AF Enterprise AO will receive an ATC after the 
system is reviewed for compliance with the required security controls, and the community risk 
imposed by the connecting system is determined to be at an acceptable level. 
6.5.2.  AF systems authorized through another AF AO will submit the ATC request through 
eMASS. 
6.5.3.  Non-AF owned systems with approved authorizations (i.e., "Guest System", see para 
6.6) are required to have an ATC request initiated in eMASS by the AF sponsor, the PM, or 
information system owner before the IT connects to the AFIN. 
6.5.4.  The AF Enterprise SCA will identify and maintain a listing of the Tier 1and 2 (common) 
security controls on the Air Force RMF Knowledge Service. Furthermore, the AF Enterprise 
SCA will specify continuous monitoring requirements for each of the identified common 
controls. (T-1) 
6.5.5.  Certain security controls are designated as required (to address community risk 
concerns) of all systems requesting a connection to the AFIN. Some of these required controls 
may be inherited from the Tier 1and 2 Common security controls. Required controls may not 
be tailored during the security control selection or tailoring steps. Regardless of the source (i.e., 
Tier 1and 2 inherited or provide by the system), a status of “Compliant” or “Non-Compliant” 
is required for each of these controls. The assessment of these controls and associated artifacts 
will determine whether the AF system poses an unacceptable risk to the AFIN or other systems 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
29 
connected to or residing on the AFIN (i.e., imposes community risk). Furthermore, the AF 
Enterprise SCA will specify continuous monitoring requirements for each of the identified 
required controls. 
6.5.6.  The AF Enterprise AO will document the ATC decision in eMASS. (T-1) 
6.6.  Guest System Registration.  A special case, limited registration of a system that is 
authorized by a non-AF Authorizing Official, or is owned by a non-Air Force organization but is 
hosted within the AFIN. 
6.6.1.  IT identified as a Guest System must provide the name of the AF sponsor to 
usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6zr-workflow@mail.mil. 
6.6.2.  Guest system requests must provide: system acronym, system name, brief system 
description, authorization termination date, and organization that granted the authorization. If 
possible, identify the AF community that will use the system and a recommended sponsor. 
6.6.3.  SAF/CN will prepare a memo to document the appointed sponsor. The AF sponsor will 
then enter the system into eMASS and act as a liaison with the external customer. Systems 
authorized by another AO are required, as a minimum, to provide a topology and valid 
authorization document for the system being connected. Additionally, the following RMF 
artifacts or other equivalent are required: Sponsor memo; authorization decision document; 
port, protocol, and services listing; hardware/software list; security assessment report; and plan 
of action and milestones. Additionally, space systems identified as AF IT investments must 
register in ITIPS. (T-1) 
6.7.  ATC Process for Air Force Functional/Mission Systems. 
6.7.1.  AF functional/mission systems (e.g., A4, SAF/Financial Management (SAF/FM), 
program management offices) with an AF Authorization to Operate, interim authorization to 
test, or authorization to operate (ATO) with conditions signed by an AF AO (other than the AF 
Enterprise AO) require an ATC to the AF information networks. 
6.7.2.  The Functional/Mission System program manager or AO Staff is responsible for 
submitting requests for obtaining an ATC from the AF Enterprise AO. For systems/enclaves 
connecting to/through the AFIN, ATC requests are submitted to the AF Enterprise AO in 
eMASS as a “Guest System”. For systems/enclaves connecting to/through the AFNET or 
AFNET-S, ATC requests are submitted to the AF Enterprise AO through the “Manage ATC” 
function in eMASS. Contact the AF Enterprise AO staff for additional connection (contractor, 
commercial internet service provider, direct) information and guidance. 
6.8.  Continuous Monitoring.  AF IT ISSMs must ensure the controls identified as required for 
an ATC are monitored IAW the published continuous monitoring strategy guidance. The details 
will be included in the system-level ISCM strategy and evaluation and approved by the receiving 
AO. (T-3) If the system fails to meet the continuous monitoring requirements, a denial of approval 
to connect may be issued. 
6.9.  Denial of Approval to Connect.  The AF Enterprise AO may issue a denial of approval to 
connect for any IT (connected to the AFIN or other AF enclave) at any time, if the Enterprise AO 
determines the risk to the receiving enclave is too high. The PM or information system owner is 
notified immediately of the denial of approval to connect. 
30 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
6.9.1.  If the system is already connected, the connection must be terminated when the denial 
of approval to connect is signed. (T-3) 
6.9.2.  All denial decisions must be signed by the hosting enclave AO, and cannot be delegated 
further. (T-2)

Chapter 7 
SECURITY CONTROL OVERLAYS 
7.1.  Overview.  Overlays provide communities of interest an opportunity for consistent tailoring 
of security controls based on risk specific to a type of information, system, or environment. They 
include characteristics and assumptions about the overlay topic, security control and control 
enhancement specifications, risk-based rationale for control specifications (tied back to the 
characteristics/assumptions) supplemental guidance, and tailoring guidance designed to refine the 
control selection and tailoring process. 
7.2.  Policy.  The DoD may vet all AF overlays for consideration as a DoD or CNSS overlay. The 
responsible authorizing official for the type of information, system, or environment that is the 
subject of the overlay and who are principally impacted by the use of a proposed overlay will (with 
the support and concurrence of all affected parties) generate and approve overlays. The AF CISO 
will approve overlays that have AF-wide impact. 
7.3.  Development and Approval Process.  The overlay development team should coordinate 
with SAF/CNZR, Cybersecurity Risk Management, throughout the development process. 
7.3.1.  Send topic to AF Cybersecurity Technical Action Group (TAG) Chairs. (OPR: Overlay 
Proposer) All potential topics for overlays are submitted to the AF Cybersecurity TAG Chairs 
for 
validation. 
Topics 
should 
be 
sent 
to 
usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6zr-
workflow@mail.mil. The topics should include the following information: Name of proposed 
overlay; use case for overlay application; summary of the unique characteristics that drive the 
need to tailor controls; applicable laws, regulations, or directives governing the application of 
the overlay; and point of contact information. 
7.3.2.  Validate Topic. (OPR: AF Cybersecurity TAG) The TAG Chairs will provide the 
proposed overlay information to TAG members for an electronic vote. The TAG will consider 
whether the proposed overlay is relevant to AF IT, as well as ensure there are no conflicts with 
overlays in development, approved, or disapproved previously. Adjustments to the topic may 
be made in coordination with the overlay proposer. 
7.3.3.  Support Overlay Development. (OPR: overlay proposer/ overlay development team; 
OCR: SAF/CN, Cybersecurity) The overlay proposer is responsible for identifying an overlay 
development team to build the overlay and supporting documentation. SAF/CNZR, 
Cybersecurity Division, can assist with the policy requirements for the overlay. 
7.3.4.  Develop Overlay. (OPR: Overlay Proposer, Overlay Development Team, OCR: ISSM, 
AF CISO) Use the template provided in CNSSI No. 1253, Appendix F, attachment 2, to 
develop the overlay. In addition to the specified controls, the Overlay Development Team must 
include any adjustments to implementation guidance, assessment procedures, and specific 
assignment values for the selected controls. (T-3) 
7.3.5.  The tailoring guidance must clearly state any limitations or restrictions to guide 
application of the overlay. All security control specifications must be justified based on the 
risk specific to the type of information, system, or environment that is the topic of the overlay, 
and that risk must trace back to a characteristic and/or assumption clearly stated in the front 
matter of the overlay. (T-3) 
32 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
7.4.  Review and Coordinate Finalized Overlay. 
7.4.1.  OPR: SAF/CNZR, Cybersecurity Division. When the Overlay Development Team has 
completed required actions, the overlay and overlay approval memorandum is provided to 
SAF/CNZR for review and posting, as applicable (mission system use, AF or other use, and 
dissemination). SAF/CNZR will review the selected controls, implementation guidance, 
assessment procedures, specific assignment values, and tailoring guidance for compliance with 
the CNSSI No. 1253 format. If there are discrepancies in the overlay, the submitting 
organization must address those prior to gaining final approval. (T-3) 
7.4.2.  OPR: Overlay proposer. Overlays are developed to address risks specific to the type of 
information, system, or environment; therefore, as the risk changes so should the overlay. 
Ensure review and modification of the overlay are captured in the security plan and other 
applicable documentation. 
7.5.  Coordinate with Defense Information Systems Agency to Implement Overlay in 
eMASS.  (OPR: SAF/CN, Cybersecurity) SAF/CNZR, Cybersecurity Division, will coordinate 
with the Defense Information Systems Agency to implement the approved overlay on the NIPRNet 
and or SIPRNet instances of eMASS. Restrictions on use approved by the Mission Area Owner 
will be communicated to Defense Information Systems Agency. (T-1)

Chapter 8 
TRANSFER OF IT BETWEEN AUTHORIZING OFFICIALS 
8.1.  Overview.  SAF/CN must ensure that Every IT system is properly aligned to an AO. (T-1) 
The overall objective is to ensure the transition process is standard and consistent. The transition 
process is defined as the transfer of IT to include documentation from one AO to another AO. It is 
a collaborative process executed by the owning AO and coordinated with the receiving AO. The 
Request Transfer of Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official Form (available on 
the AF RMF Knowledge Service) will be used to facilitate an orderly and timely transfer of IT. 
Transferring IT, projected transfer dates, and system transfer preconditions will be coordinated 
with the applicable AOs and their staffs. The AOs will ensure process accountability and 
situational/stakeholder awareness throughout this process. (T-3) 
8.2.  Transition Process.  The transition process steps are as follows: 
8.2.1.  The owning AO staff, in coordination with the PM or ISO, if no PM is assigned, 
identifies the IT to transfer from an owning AO to the receiving AO. 
8.2.2.  As the AO staff identifies IT for transfer, it is important to include the MAJCOM 
portfolio manager (PfM) (See Terms) of the IT in this identification process, as the PfM has 
an integral role in all IT transfer actions. 
8.2.3.  The owning AO reviews and approves the proposed IT to transfer to the receiving AO. 
8.2.4.  The PM or ISO of the IT completes the Request Transfer of Information Technology to 
Another Authorizing Official Form for each IT. 
8.2.5.  The owning AO staff, in coordination with the PM/ISO and PfM, contacts the receiving 
AO staff/PM to discuss the proposed IT transfer. 
8.2.6.  The receiving AO staff completes the Assessment/Notes section of Request Transfer of 
Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official Form. 
8.2.7.  The owning AO and receiving AO agree to the transfer (skip to paragraph 8.2.9). 
8.2.8.  If the receiving AO disagrees with the transfer, the owning AO staff will request 
assistance from the AFRMC by sending the Request Transfer of Information Technology to 
Another Authorizing Official Form to SAF/CNZR workflow at usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-
a6.mbx.a6zr-workflow@mail.mil. The AFRMC will adjudicate the inclusion/transfer of the 
IT and provide a recommendation to the CISO as the final decision authority. 
8.2.9.  Once both AOs agree to the IT transfer, the owning AO and receiving AO sign the 
Request Transfer AO to AO Form. 
8.2.10.  The PM/ISO, in coordination with the PfM, will make required changes in ITIPS and 
eMASS. 
 
 
34 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
 
8.3.  IT With No AO Assigned.  Systems not currently under any AO’s authority, not fitting into 
an authorization boundary, or not accepted by the gaining AO are addressed by the AFRMC. If 
the ITCSC identifies the IT should be assigned in the “other” AO Authorization Boundary, then 
SAF/CNZR, Cybersecurity Division, retains the IT until the new AO Authorization Boundary is 
created and an AO is assigned. If an existing boundary is determined, the submitted ITCSC is 
returned to the PM/ISO for staffing to and approval by the determined AO.

FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT AND AUDIT READINESS (FIAR) INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY (IT) 
9.1.  Overview.  This Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Information 
Technology (IT) attachment applies to individuals at all levels who manage FIAR IT resources 
including the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard except where noted otherwise. Audit 
ready IT resources are defined by SAF/FM and are generally described as systems which have 
some level of impact on the Air Force Financial Statements. This attachment provides guidance 
specific to FIAR/ Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual RMF implementation and 
should be used in concert with higher level Air Force and DoD policies and procedures. 
9.2.  Definition.  Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) systems are defined as core 
financial systems, mixed-systems, non-financial systems, and micro-applications that support key 
financial processes (i.e., general ledger management, funds management, payment management, 
receivable management, and cost management). These include systems that are relevant to 
financial statement disclosures, and that must operate reliably to protect the integrity of financial 
statement assertions. The list below describes characteristics that place a system in-scope for 
FIAR: 
9.2.1.  Security controls within the system are identified as key controls in the internal controls 
assessment; 
9.2.2.  Systems are used to generate or store original key supporting documentation; 
9.2.3.  Reports generated by the system are utilized in the execution of key controls; or 
9.2.4.  Systems are relied upon to perform material calculations (i.e., to compute payroll). 
9.3.  Responsibilities.  The following assignments of responsibility are additions to the 
responsibilities outlined in Chapter 3, rather than substitutions. 
9.3.1.  SAF/FM FIAR Validator. The SAF/FM FIAR Validator will define and oversee 
Financial Management (FM) Validator activities. 
9.3.2.  Authorizing Official (AO). AOs assigned to AF FIAR information systems will assess 
and determine the level of overall system cybersecurity risk before authorizing such systems 
to process, store, display, or transmit financial or financially-related information. AOs will 
coordinate with the SAF/FM FIAR Validator for deficiencies associated with key FIAR 
controls. 
9.4.  FM Security control Implementation Guidance. 
9.4.1.  RMF security control baselines align closely with the controls that are intended to 
protect the integrity of financial information and processes as noted in the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO), GAO-09-232G, Federal Information System Controls Audit 
Manual. Successfully executing the RMF and implementing related controls is tantamount to 
satisfying most FM IT General Controls. 
 
 
36 
AFI17-101  6 FEBRUARY 2020 
 
9.4.2.  Secretary of the Air Force/Financial Management (SAF/FM) developed and manages 
FM supplemental guidance to augment and extend the RMF controls baseline. This control 
guidance is intended to be used in conjunction with the RMF process with the goal being to 
manage cybersecurity and Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual risk 
simultaneously.

Enterprise—An organization with a defined mission/goal and a defined boundary, using 
information systems to execute that mission, and with responsibility for managing its own risks 
and performance. An enterprise may consist of all or some of the following business aspects: 
acquisition, program management, financial management (e.g., budgets), human resources, 
security, and information systems, information and mission management. Guest System—A 
special case, limited registration of a system that is authorized by a non-AF Authorizing Official, 
or is owned by a non-Air Force organization but is hosted within the AFIN and must complete the 
process to acquire an approval to connect (ATC) from the AF Enterprise AO. A Guest System is 
a type of external information system (see CNSSI No. 4009). 
High and Very High Risk Determination—IT risk, including High and Very High risk 
determination, is continually assessed by the Air Force Chief Information Security Officer through 
evaluation of Likelihood and Impact findings and in concert with CNSSI No.1253; NIST SP 800-
30; and NIST SP 80053r4, Appendix D. 
Impact—The effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other 
organizations, or the Nation (including the national security interests of the United States) of a loss 
of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system. 
Likelihood—A weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat 
is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or a set of vulnerabilities. 
MAJCOM Portfolio Manager (PfM)—Serves as the advisor to a Program Manager and/or 
Project manager (if established) IAW AFI 17-110. 
Mission Area Owner—The Mission Area Owner role is consistent with the PAO role described 
in DoDI 8510.01 in that an owner is identified/ appointed and responsible for security/ 
cybersecurity issues for each of the DoD Mission Area's. IAW AFPD 16-14, EIEMA (CIO); BMA 
(MG); DIMA (A2); WMA (AF A3/5). 
Platform Information Technology (PIT)—Information technology (IT), both hardware and 
software, that is physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in real time to the mission performance 
of special purpose systems. 
PIT Product—Individual hardware or software components, including, but not limited to, 
operating systems, commercial or government software, or individual hardware that support 
specific mission functionality. IT Products, when purposed for PIT, become PIT Products. 
PIT Subsystem—A collection of PIT that does not rise to the level of a PIT system. 
PIT System—A collection of PIT within an identified boundary under the control of a single 
authority and security policy. The systems may be structured by physical proximity or by function, 
independent of location. 
Risk Management Framework (RMF)—The Risk Management Framework is a structured 
approach used to oversee and manage risk for an enterprise.
