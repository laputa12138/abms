AF Information Network (AFIN) — The globally interconnected, end-to-end set of AF 
information capabilities, and associated processes for collecting, processing, storing, 
disseminating, and managing information on-demand to AF warfighters, policy makers, and 
support personnel, including owned and leased communications and computing systems and 
services, software (including applications), data, security  services, other associated services, and 
national security systems.” (Derived from the JP 3-12 definition of DoDIN). 
Business Mission Area (BMA)—The BMA ensures that the right capabilities, resources, and 
materiel are reliably delivered to our warfighters: what they need, where they need it, when they 
need it, anywhere in the world. In order to cost-effectively meet these requirements, the DoD 
current business and financial management infrastructure - processes, systems, and data 
standards - are being transformed to ensure better support to the warfighter and improve 
accountability to the taxpayer. Integration of business transformation for the DoD business 
enterprise is led by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in his role as the Chief Operating Officer of 
the Department. (DoDI 8115.02). 
Core Function Lead—SecAF/CSAF-appointed senior leader responsible for specific Core 
Functions (CF) providing AF-level, long-term views. CFLs integrate Total Force concepts, 
capabilities, modernization, and resourcing to ensure future assigned core capabilities across the 
range of military operations as directed by AF Strategy and Strategic Planning Guidance. CFLs 
are responsible for the Core Function Support Plan and recommendations for the development of 
the POM for the assigned CF. CFLs have tasking authority regarding CF issues to identify 
enabling capabilities and integration requirements/opportunities. (AFPD 90-11). 
Cybersecurity—Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic 
communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and 
electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, 
integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. (DoDI 8500.01). 
Cyberspace—A global domain within the information environment consisting of the 
interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including 
the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and 
controllers. (Joint Pub 3-12)  NOTE: synonymous with cyber when used as an adjective. 
Defense Intelligence Mission Area (DIMA)—The DIMA includes IT investments within the 
Military Intelligence Program and Defense component programs of the National Intelligence 
Program. The USD(I) has delegated responsibility for managing the DIMA portfolio to the 
Director, Defense Intelligence Agency, but USD(I) retains final signature authority. DIMA 
management will require coordination of issues among portfolios that extend beyond the 
Department of Defense to the overall Intelligence Community. (DoDI 8115.02). 
Enterprise Architecture (EA)—The explicit description and documentation of the current and 
desired relationships among business and management processes and supporting resources (e.g., 
IT, personnel). It describes the "current architecture" and "target architecture," to include the 
AFPD 17-1  12 APRIL 2016 
13 
rules, standards, and systems life cycle information to optimize and maintain the environment 
which the agency wishes to create and maintain by managing its IT portfolio. The EA must also 
provide a strategy that will enable the agency to support its current state and also act as the 
roadmap for transition to its target environment. These transition processes will include an 
agency's capital planning and investment control processes, agency EA planning processes, and 
agency systems life cycle methodologies. The EA will define principles and goals and set 
direction on such issues as the promotion of interoperability, open systems, public access, 
compliance with Government Paperwork Elimination Act, end user satisfaction, and IT security. 
The agency must support the EA with a complete inventory of agency information resources, 
including personnel, equipment, and funds devoted to information resources management and 
information technology, at an appropriate level of detail. 
Governance—Governance is the framework of rules and practices that ensures continuity, 
collaboration, and de-confliction of interests across an organization to clearly define policies, 
processes, and investments. (IDFP V2.0). 
Implementation Baseline (IB)—The Implementation Baseline is the baseline of acquisition 
selected products and their informed/allowed configurations that implement the architecture, 
standards and protocols, and guidelines specified in the Target Baseline. The Implementation 
Baseline informs the Operational Baseline of the acquisition selected products and how they are 
to be configured to support deployment of user applications across the infrastructure topology. 
The Implementation Baseline governs the implementation of the Development and 
Integration/Test environments. 
Information Dominance —The operational advantage gained from the ability to collect, 
control, exploit, and defend information to optimize decision making and maximize warfighting 
effects. (AF Information Dominance Strategy). 
Information Environment — The aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that 
collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. (JP 3-13). 
Information Environment Mission Area (IEMA)—IEMA is the DoD information (IT) 
portfolio that manages investments in the current and future integrated information sharing, 
computing and communications environment of the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The IE 
comprises GIG assets that operate as, provide information transport for, perform enterprise 
management of, and assure various levels and segments of the enterprise network, ranging from 
local area to wide area networks and from tactical to operational and strategic networks.  The 
domains are Communications, Computing Infrastructure, Core Enterprise Services, and 
Information Assurance. (DoDI 8115.02). 
Information System (IS)—A discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, 
processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. (44 U.S.C. 
Sec 3502). 
Information Technology (IT)—Any equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of 
equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, 
movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or 
information by the executive agency. This includes equipment used by a Component directly, or 
used by a contractor under a contract with the Component, which (i) requires the use of such 
equipment, or (ii) requires the use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the performance 
14 
AFPD 17-1  12 APRIL 2016 
of a service or the furnishing of a product.  The term “IT” also includes computers, ancillary 
equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and 
related resources. Notwithstanding the above, the term “IT” does not include any equipment that 
is required by a Federal contractor incidental to a Federal contract. Note: The above term is 
considered synonymous with the term “information system” as defined and used in AF 
programs. The term “IT” does not include National Security Systems (NSS) according to 44 
USC 3502. 
IT Portfolio Management (Portfolio management)—The management of selected groupings 
of IT resources using strategic planning, architectures, and outcome-based performance measures 
to achieve a mission capability (CJCSI 8410.01, Warfighting Mission Area Information 
Technology Portfolio Management and Net-Centric Data Sharing).  (DoDD 8115.01). 
Lead Command —A type of MAJCOM that consolidates responsibilities for a particular 
function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire AF as applicable. (AFI 38-101). 
Mission Area Roadmap—A plan which guides the implementation of capabilities across a 
Mission Area. (DoDD 8115.02). 
National Security System (NSS)—Any information system (including any telecommunications 
system) used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on 
behalf of an agency, the function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities; 
involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves command and control of 
military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or is 
critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. (40 USC 11103.  See also 
NIST SP 800-59). 
Operational Baseline (OB)—The Operational Baseline is the set of components of the AF IT 
infrastructure that specifies the exact laydown and configurations of hardware and software 
within all facilities in the AF infrastructure topology and provide the required warfighter 
capabilities and performance. 
Platform Information Technology (PIT) — A special purpose system which employs 
computing resources (i.e., hardware, firmware, and optionally software) that are physically 
embedded in, dedicated to, or essential in real time to the mission performance. It only performs 
(i.e., is dedicated to) the information processing assigned to it by its hosting special purpose 
system (this is not for core services). Examples include, but are not limited to: SCADA type 
systems, training simulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment. (AFI 33-210). 
Target Baseline (TB)—The Target Baseline specifies the standards, protocols, guidelines and 
implementation constraints for the future state of the AFIN Infrastructure. It is used to inform the 
development of the implementation baseline. The Target Baseline is thoroughly documented and 
continually updated based upon emerging industry standards and the evolving AFEA. 
Warfighting Integration—Ensuring information interoperability and compatibility of 
warfighting capabilities (e.g., people, processes, and technology) across the Air Force service 
core functions and within joint capability areas. 
Warfighting Mission Area (WMA—)—The WMA provides life cycle oversight to applicable 
DoD Component and Combatant Commander IT investments (programs, systems, and 
initiatives). WMA IT investments support and enhance the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
AFPD 17-1  12 APRIL 2016 
15 
Staff’s joint warfighting priorities while supporting actions to create a net-centric distributed 
force, capable of full spectrum dominance through decision and information superiority. WMA 
IT investments ensure Combatant Commands can meet the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff’s strategic challenges to win the war on terrorism, accelerate transformation, and strengthen 
joint warfighting through organizational agility, action and decision speed, collaboration, 
outreach, and professional development. (DoDI 8115.02).
