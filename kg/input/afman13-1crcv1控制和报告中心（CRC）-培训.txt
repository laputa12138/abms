1.3.2.  MQT (See Chapter 3).  MQT provides crewmembers the advanced training necessary 
to qualify to perform the command or unit mission in an assigned crew position.  Crewmembers 
maintain BQ status until completion of MQT.  Upon completion of MQT and associated 
Stan/Eval requirements, in accordance with AFMAN 13-1 GBMC2V2, individuals are 
designated BMC/CMR. MQT is not required for attached Wing personnel unless required by 
unit leadership. 
1.3.3.  BMC and CMR training requirements and currencies are outlined in Chapter 4 and/or 
the RTM. 
1.3.3.1.  BMC designated crewmembers may have primary jobs or staff functions that 
directly support the mission design series (MDS) mission.  BMC crewmembers maintain 
familiarization with all unit core missions.  They may also maintain proficiency and 
qualification in some of the unit core missions.  BMC crewmembers must be able to attain 
CMR status in 30 duty days or less.  (T-3) 
1.3.3.1.1.  BMC crewmembers may participate in any mission for which they are

mission capable (N-BMC) status. 
1.3.3.2.  CMR crewmembers maintain currency and proficiency in all core missions of 
their assigned or attached unit.  CMR entails accomplishing the minimum required training 
requirements for crewmembers to be qualified and proficient in all the primary missions 
tasked for their duty position. 
1.3.4.  CT (See Chapter 4).  CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix 
of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification/certification level.  
RAP is the combat coded/DOC-tasked unit CT program designed to focus training on needed 
combat/contingency skills.  Base a crewmember’s CT/RAP requirements on the 
crewmember’s current experienced or inexperienced status (see paragraph 1.3.6 for the 
definition of experience levels).  When a crewmember changes experience levels, prorate 
training requirements from the date of experience change.  Specific RAP requirements are 
issued by MAJCOMs via the RTM. 
1.3.5.  Unqualified (UQ).  UQ crewmembers fall under one or more of the following 
categories: 
1.3.5.1.  Downgraded for being non-combat mission ready (N-CMR) or N-BMC exceeding 
180 calendar days. 
1.3.5.2.  BQ members downgraded for being non-current for 180 calendar days. 
1.3.5.3.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability. 
1.3.5.4.  Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a periodic evaluation or at the

of individuals who are not entered into IQT within the above timeline and the reason for the 
delay. 
2.5.5.  IQT Time Limitations  .  All trainees must complete IQT requirements within 150 
calendar days (18 RSD for ANG).  (T-3) Authorized deviations will be in accordance with 
paragraph 1.4.5.  Upon completion of the last block of IQT, the COT certifies the trainee on 
AF Form 4141 as ready for initial qualification (INIT QUAL) evaluation and released to 
Stan/Eval to complete an evaluation in accordance with AFMAN 13-1 CRCV2.  After a 
successful evaluation, individuals are designated BQ and placed into MQT.  Individuals failing 
the evaluation return to DOT to complete all AT and then re-released to Stan/Eval.  Failure to 
complete IQT requirements within the above time constraints results in the COT pursuing 
actions outlined in the following sub-paragraphs.  Trainees continue to train while training 
extension requests are being staffed. 
2.5.5.1.  Upon reaching the 150th calendar day (18th RSD for ANG), trainees not 
completing IQT are referred to the SQ/CC who is authorized to grant a 30-calendar day 
(two RSDs for ANG) extended training period or administer other actions in accordance 
with AFMAN 36-2100, and/or AFMAN 11-402 in lieu of an extension. 
2.5.5.2.  Upon reaching the 180th calendar day (20th RSD for ANG) trainees not 
completing IQT are referred to the SQ/CC who may request a 30-calendar day (two RSDs 
22 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
for ANG) extended training period from the group commander (ACC/A3CG for ANG).  If 
disapproved, the SQ/CC will take actions in accordance with AFMAN 36-2100, and/or 
AFMAN 11-402.  (T-2) 
2.5.5.3.  Upon reaching the 210th calendar day (22nd RSD for ANG) trainees not 
completing IQT are referred to the SQ/CC who may request 30-calendar day (two RSDs 
for ANG) additional extended training period from the MAJCOM OPR (ACC/A3)  or 
USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ (USAFE-AFAFRICA units) routing the request through the 
chain of command to the MAJCOM OPR.  The trainee enters the 30-calendar day (two 
RSDs for ANG) extension while staffing the request.  These days will count towards the 
30-calendar days (two RSDs for ANG) of extended training if approved.  (T-2) If denied 
at any level, the SQ/CC will act in accordance with AFMAN 36-2100, and/or AFMAN 11-
402.  (T-2) 
2.5.5.4.  In lieu of a training extension request, the SQ/CC may take other actions in 
accordance with AFMAN 36-2100, and/or AFMAN 11-402. 
2.5.5.5.  Trainees not completing IQT by the 240th calendar day (24th RSD for ANG) will 
be referred to the SQ/CC for action in accordance with AFMAN 36-2100, and/or AFMAN 
11-402.  (T-2) 
2.6.  Training Documentation, Reports and Forms.  Complete training documentation in 
accordance with Chapter 8. 
2.7.  Waivers. 
2.7.1.  Waiver authority for IQT and upgrade course syllabi has been delegated to WG/CCs 
unless otherwise stipulated. 
2.7.2.  For IQT not conducted at the FTU: 
2.7.2.1.  The SQ/CC is the approval authority for IQT proficiency advancement when the 
student demonstrates performance above syllabus standards.  Do not use proficiency 
advancement as a management tool for the purpose of graduating students or completing 
IQT by a specific date. 
2.7.2.2.  The SQ/DO submits a memo to the SQ/CC reflecting any academic lessons or 
mission events that are to be waived for an individual based on previous qualification(s) or 
experience.  The SQ/CC approves/disapproves the request. 
2.7.2.3.  The SQ/CC may authorize student and instructor training deviations for inclement 
weather and/or adverse local conditions.  Deviations are to be consistent with good training 
management, in the best interest of the student’s progress and experience level.  All 
prerequisite academic training requirements are accomplished before associated positional 
training requirements. 
2.7.2.4.  Approval for syllabus deviations as noted above is documented in accordance with 
Chapter 8. 
 
 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
23 
2.7.3.  At the SQ/CC’s discretion, individuals with prior positional qualification(s), but not UQ 
for longer than 60 months in an MDS utilizing a like-system as defined by the RTM, may be 
entered into a tailored IQT program developed by the COT.  For members that have not held 
a like-system positional qualification within the last 60 months refer to paragraph 2.1.1 and 
2.1.2.  A tailored IQT plan is in-lieu of a formal IQT course, to prepare them for their INIT 
QUAL evaluation, and members do not require a waiver to FTU attendance.  The SQ/CC 
approves all tailored training plans. 
2.7.3.1.  Example 1:  SrA Smith completes a PCS from the 621st ACS (BCC) to the 729th 
ACS (CRC).  Upon in-processing the COT reviews SrA Smith’s records.  SrA Smith still 
has an active ICT qualification in the BCC, the COT develops and recommends a tailored 
MSO IQT plan to the SQ/CC.  The SQ/CC may choose to accomplish the tailored IQT plan 
in-unit or refer the member to the FTU in accordance with paragraph 2.1.1. 
2.7.3.2.  Example 2:  Maj Jones completes a PCS from Langley (ACC Staff) to the 726th 
ACS (CRC).  Maj Jones was last qualified 64 months ago in the CRC and has prior 
qualification experience in the E-3.  Upon in-processing the COT reviews Maj Jones’ 
records and determines that he is not eligible for a tailored IQT plan.  The COT then 
schedules Maj Jones for IQT with the FTU in accordance with paragraph 2.1.2.

Chapter 3 
MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT) 
3.1.  General.  This chapter outlines MQT required to qualify personnel to perform crew duties 
during CRC operational and training missions.  MQT upgrades crewmembers from BQ to 
CMR/BMC status.  Crewmembers are to complete MQT for each positional qualification (e.g., a 
qualified ST selected for upgrade to AST will complete MQT for the AST position following 
completion of AST IQT). (T-3) MQT is to be flexible to the dynamic changes and unique missions 
of the units covered by this manual. 
3.1.1.  MAJCOMs ensure MQT completion using MAJCOM-approved program. 
3.1.1.1.  Units using these approved programs will follow the guidance within the 
applicable course control documents.  (T-3) 
3.1.1.2.  Units will develop local MQT programs, approved by the MAJCOM, if HHQ 
developed programs are not provided.  (T-2) For units using an academic test, the passing 
score will be 85%.   (T-3) 
3.1.2.  Prerequisites.  At the CRC, individuals must possess a current CRC qualification for 
entry into MQT.  (T-3) 
3.1.3.  Elimination Procedures.  Units will follow MQT elimination procedures outlined in 
specific course syllabi and the guidance outlined in this manual.  (T-3) The TEB process is 
outlined in Chapter 9 and AFMAN 11-402 for aircrew members subject to flying evaluation 
boards. 
3.2.  Time Period to Qualify.  Complete MQT in accordance with the appropriate Course Control 
Documents in addition to the following. 
3.2.1.  Personnel who complete IQT at the FTU will enter unit managed MQT NLT 20-
calendar days (one RSD for ANG) after signing into their unit or the first available MQT course 
at the FTU regardless of time allotted between IQT and MQT. (T-3) 
3.2.1.1.  Personnel who complete IQT at the FTU and subsequently attend FTAC at their 
home unit, will enter MQT the first duty day after completing the FTAC program.  (T-3) 
3.2.1.2.  Personnel who complete IQT at the operational unit, achieving BQ status for their 
duty position, are immediately (NLT the next duty day or next RSD for ANG) released 
back to DOT and entered MQT. 
3.2.2.  MQT Time Limitations.  All trainees must complete MQT requirements within 60-
calendar days (six RSDs for ANG) of entering MQT. (T-3) Upon completion of the last block 
of MQT, the COT certifies the trainee on the AF Form 4141 as ready for the mission 
qualification (MSN) evaluation and released to Stan/Eval to complete an evaluation in 
accordance with AFMAN 13-1 CRCV2.  After successful evaluation, individuals are 
designated CMR/BMC.  Individuals failing the evaluation will return to DOT to complete all 
AT and then re-released to Stan/Eval.  (T-3) Failure to complete MQT requirements within the 
above time constraints results in the COT pursuing actions outlined in the following sub-
paragraphs.  Trainees continue to train while the training extension request is being staffed. 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
25 
3.2.2.1.  Upon reaching the 60th calendar MQT day (sixth RSDs for ANG), trainees not 
completing MQT are referred to the SQ/CC who is authorized to grant a 30-calendar day 
(two RSDs for ANG) extended training period or administer other actions in accordance 
with AFMAN 36-2100, and/or AFMAN 11-402. 
3.2.2.2.  Upon reaching the 90th calendar day of MQT (eighth RSD for ANG), trainees not 
completing MQT are referred to the SQ/CC who may request a 30-calendar day (two RSDs 
for ANG) extended training period from the group commander (ACC/A3CG for ANG 
units).  If disapproved, the SQ/CC will take actions in accordance with AFMAN 36-2100, 
and/or AFMAN 11-402.  (T-2) 
3.2.2.3.  Upon reaching the 120th calendar MQT day (tenth RSD for ANG), trainees not 
completing MQT are referred to the SQ/CC who may request a 30-calendar day additional 
extended training period from the MAJCOM OPR (ACC/A3C (ACC/ANG units)) or 
USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ (USAFE-AFAFRICA units) routing the request through the 
chain of command to the MAJCOM OPR.  The trainee enters the 30-calendar day (two 
RSDs for ANG) of extension while the request is being staffed.  These days count towards 
the 30-calendar days of extended training if approved.  If the request is denied at any level, 
the SQ/CC will act in accordance with AFMAN 36-2100 and/or AFMAN 11-402.  (T-2) 
3.2.2.4.  Trainees not completing MQT by the 150th calendar MQT day (one year for 
ANG), will be referred to the SQ/CC for action in accordance with AFMAN 36-2100, 
and/or AFMAN 11-402.  (T-2) 
3.3.  CMR/BMC Certification. 
3.3.1.  Upon completion of IQT and MQT, the SQ/CC certifies crewmembers as CMR or 
BMC.  The COT records entry into CT-CMR or CT-BMC on the AF Form 4141.  The SQ/DO 
identifies the primary duty position of multi-certified/qualified personnel on the AF Form 4141 
and Letter of Qualification/Certification. 
3.3.2.  Group, 752 OSS, 133d Test Squadron, or attached personnel are assigned BMC status 
upon completion of IQT and MQT and placed into CT unless they are tasked with deployment 
support which requires CMR status.

AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
Chapter 4 
CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 
4.1.  General.  This chapter in conjunction with the RTM outline CT event requirements needed 
to maintain CRC/DRU qualification, currency, and lookback.  CT provides crewmembers with the 
volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency at the assigned 
qualification/certification level.  The RAP is a category of CT designed to focus combat 
coded/DOC-tasked unit training toward projected/forthcoming contingency skill sets.  Specific 
RAP instructions are issued by each MAJCOM via RTM.  DRU CT requirements should be 
outlined in the unit supplement. 
4.2.  Training Period.  CT requirements, including event currency and lookback, are 
designed/planned to be completed during a specified training cycle with specific requirements 
additionally defined by crew position.  The training cycle is defined by the RTM. 
4.3.  Prerequisites.  Crewmembers will have BQ/CMR/BMC qualification.  (T-3) 
4.4.  Waivers.  Waiver authority for RTM defined requirements is outlined in the RTM with the 
SQ/CC forwarding waiver requests to the appropriate approval authority. 
4.5.  Logging of CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators. 
4.5.1.  Instructors/evaluators perform training events in accordance with this volume and/or 
the current RTM. 
4.5.2.  At the end of the training cycle, up to 50% of required positional CT/RAP training cycle 
events (rounded down to the next whole number, but not below one) may be credited from 
instructor/evaluator monitored events, provided the instructor/evaluator monitored mission 
planning and any briefings, missions, and debriefings. 
4.5.3.  Instructor/evaluator ABMs will not log control events for solely supervising 
ABMs/WDs engaged in aircraft control. (T-3) 
4.6.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may 
prorate positional training requirements when an individual is TDY, medically disqualified/DNIC, 
on convalescent leave, emergency leave, parental leave, or equipment not available for a portion 
of the training period.  Do not consider normal annual leave as non-availability.  Exception:  ANG 
members mobilized under Title 10 United States Code (USC) Section (§)12302, Ready Reserve, 
or 10 USC (§) 12301(d), Reserve Components Generally, authority can have training requirements 
prorated for the period of leave accrued/taken under Title 10 status. 
4.6.1.  Proration is based on cumulative calendar days of non-availability in the training cycle.  
Use Table 4.1 to determine the number of months to be prorated.  Crewmembers start CT the 
month following completion of MQT and receiving initial CMR/BMC certification.  
Crewmembers that become CMR/BMC after the beginning of the training cycle accomplish a 
prorated share of existing training cycle training requirements for the remainder of the period 
beginning with the first day of the following month.  Training accomplished during IQT/MQT 
is not counted toward CT requirements. 
4.6.2.  All training requirement events are rounded down to the next whole number when 
prorating; however, no requirement may be prorated below 1. 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
27 
4.6.3.  When a crewmember changes experience levels, training requirements are prorated 
from the first day of the month following experience certification.  When a crewmember 
achieves “Experienced” certification, their annual training requirements are based on the 
“experienced” requirements in the RTM. 
4.6.4.  Prorating of requirements are documented in accordance with Chapter 8.

4.6.5.  Proration Example.  TSgt Garnett was granted 17 calendar days of emergency leave in 
January and attended Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy in-residence from March 
through April for 56 consecutive calendar days.  Using the numbers from Table 4.1., TSgt 
Garnett would be authorized a total of two months proration (for the 73 cumulative proration 
days) from the training cycle. 
4.7.  CMR/BMC Regression.  N-CMR/N-BMC crewmembers are not authorized to perform 
crew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision.  The SQ/CC or designated 
representative recertifies downgraded crewmembers, in writing, upon completion of required tasks 
to return to status. 
4.7.1.  Crewmembers are regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status for one or more of the following 
reasons: 
4.7.1.1.  Failure to meet lookback in accordance with paragraph 4.8, or for BMC/BQ 
crewmembers, failure to reestablish currency within 30-calendar days of becoming non-
current.  To regain CMR/BMC status, crewmembers follow guidance in paragraph 4.9. 
28 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
4.7.1.2.  Failure to complete training cycle CT/RAP requirements.  To regain CMR/BMC 
status crewmembers follow guidance in paragraph 4.9.  
4.7.1.3.  Receiving an overall Q-3 on a Qualification or Mission (QUAL or MSN) 
evaluation in accordance with AFMAN 13-1 CRCV2.  Crewmembers regain CMR/BMC 
status by completing a reevaluation. 
4.7.1.4.  At SQ/CC direction.  Regaining CMR/BMC status will be in accordance with 
SQ/CC direction.  (T-3) 
4.8.  Lookback.  Lookback is a management tool used to determine and monitor CMR 
crewmember proficiency during the training cycle.  Accomplish lookback requirements during a 
three-month sliding window.  Lookback requirements are outlined in the RTM. 
4.8.1.  Lookback does not apply to BMC or BQ crewmembers. 
4.8.2.  DNIC/DNIF crewmembers’ virtual/constructive training accomplishments will count 
towards lookback requirements.  (T-3) 
4.8.3.  Lookback requirements are accomplished during a one-month or three-month sliding 
window and are based on the experience level attained during the lookback period.  The COT 
will calculate the 1-month lookback NLT the first day of the month (ANG RSD).  (T-3) If any 
crewmember fails to meet 1-month lookback the COT will calculate the 3-month lookback.  
(T-3) 
4.8.3.1.  Example.  SrA Jones (a RegAF component inexperienced ICT) has a 1-month 
lookback requirement of two events and a 3-month lookback requirement of six events.  In 
June SrA Jones completed three events and in July the trainee completed two events.  If 
SrA Jones completes two events in August, he/she will meet 1-month lookback and remain 
CMR.  If SrA Jones completes only one event in August, he/she will fail 1-month lookback.  
As a result, the COT will calculate 3-month lookback and determine that SrA Jones has 
met the minimum CMR requirements.  Zero event accomplishment in August will result 
in failure to meet 3-month lookback and regression to N-CMR. 
4.8.3.2.  Lookback computations for newly qualified crewmembers begin the first of the 
next month following completion of INIT QUAL/MSN Eval and one full month of CMR 
status.  Computations for CMR-restored crewmembers begin the month following return 
to CMR status.  (T-3) 
4.8.4.  Failure to Meet Lookback.  If a CMR crewmember fails to meet lookback requirements, 
the SQ/CC may take one of the following actions: 
4.8.4.1.  Regress the individual to N-CMR status. 
4.8.4.2.  Remove the individual from a CMR manning position. 
4.8.4.3.  Initiate action to remove the crewmember from active status. 
4.8.4.4.  Place the crewmember in probation status for one month (30 days/ two RSDs).  If 
the SQ/CC chooses probation, the crewmember is required to reestablish lookback by the 
end of the probation period to remain CMR. 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
29 
4.9.  Regaining CMR/BMC Status. 
4.9.1.  Crewmembers that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status for less than 180 calendar days 
will complete SQ/DO approved training plan.  (T-3) 
4.9.1.1.  Monitored by an instructor until such time the instructor recommends the 
individual be returned to CMR status.  Use live, virtual, or constructive events to meet 
these requirements in accordance with training requirement tables. 
4.9.1.2.  Upon training completion and instructor recommendation (documented on an 
ACC Form 206 or MAJCOM equivalent), the SQ/CC or designated representative returns 
the individual to CMR/BMC status. 
4.9.1.3.  The missions and events accomplished during the training may be credited toward 
a crewmember’s lookback and total mission/event requirements for the training cycle. 
4.9.2.  If a crewmember is not current/N-CMR/N-BMC exceeding 180 calendar days, the COT 
will refer the crewmember to Stan/Eval for downgrade action to UQ status after SQ/CC 
approval.  (T-3) COT documents the downgrade and enters them into RQT with subsequent 
requalification evaluation. 
4.9.3.  Document all actions on the AF Form 4141. 
4.10.  Continuation Training Requirements.  The CT/RAP training cycle consists of academic 
and positional training requirements. 
4.10.1.  Academic Training Requirements.  The intent of the academic portion of CMR/BMC 
CT is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the unit’s DOC-tasked missions as 
well as dynamic real-world contingency environment and ever-changing TTPs.  
Recommended academic topic areas and hours are in Table 4.2. 
4.10.1.1.  The unit COT develops an academic CT/RAP training plan based on the review, 
update, and expansion of existing IQT/MQT materials, the inclusion of RTM training 
areas, and the introduction of current theater interest/focus areas.  The COT also includes 
any HHQ training inputs/guidance in the plan.  The proposed plan is submitted to the 
SQ/DO NLT 15 calendar days prior to the start of the next training cycle for approval.

4.10.1.2.  The COT, with the approval of the SQ/DO, may adjust the training plan 
throughout the training cycle to meet a dynamic operational training environment or to 
address any negative trends. 
4.10.1.3.  The COT ensures academic CT/RAP training is documented on the AF Form 
4142, Individual Annual Training Record. 
4.10.2.  Positional Training Requirements.  Keeps crewmembers proficient in the skill sets 
outlined in AFMAN 13-1 CRC Volume 3, Operating Procedures Control and Reporting 
Center (CRC). Positional training requirements should be accomplished with a full operations 
crew to the maximum extent possible. 
4.10.2.1.  The COT ensures CMR/BMC individuals meet positional training cycle 
requirements as outlined in the RTM for that training cycle. 
4.10.2.1.1.  Document positional CT/RAP training on the AF Form 4142. 
4.10.2.1.2.  Crewmembers may accomplish RAP/currency/lookback by using any 
Tactical Air Operations Module (AN/TYQ-23A) version, an ACC/A3CG-approved 
like system, (identified in the CRC RTM) an ACC/A3CG-designated approved 
AN/TYQ-23A simulator (Battlespace Command and Control Center Mobile Training 
Suite executing operations in accordance with AFMAN 13-1 CRC series instructions 
and applicable TTP), AN/TPS-75 Radar Set, or AN/TSQ-147, JTIDS Module. 
4.10.2.2.  Failure to Meet Positional Training Requirements. 
4.10.2.2.1.  Unless waived, crewmembers failing to accomplish positional training 
requirements are regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status. 
4.10.2.2.2.  Unless waived, the crewmember remains N-CMR/N-BMC until all 
overdue positional training requirements are accomplished or the crewmember 
accomplishes appropriate/specific training, as directed by SQ/CC. 
4.10.2.2.3.  Unless waived, all training requirements for the previous training cycle 
must be completed before events are credited toward the next training cycle.  (T-3) 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
31 
4.10.2.2.4.  SQ/CC, via TDRs, must inform the applicable MAJCOM through their 
chain of command, of any potential training shortfalls resulting from individuals not 
meeting their training cycle requirements in accordance with paragraph 1.2.6.6.  (T-2) 
4.10.3.  SQ/DO ensures virtual/constructive missions are accomplished in the most effective 
manner possible and where live missions are deficient/insufficient.  Virtual/constructive 
missions/scenarios increasingly stress a more difficult tactical scenario as individual 
crewmembers and crews become more proficient.  Virtual/constructive missions stress skills 
or situations not normally controlled under live conditions (e.g., aircraft emergencies, multiple 
tankers in different airspaces).  Virtual missions include those accomplished through any of 
the following environments:  Distributed training operations center (DTOC), and any other 
DMO entity (e.g., Virtual Flags, Fleet Synthetic Training-Joint (FST-J)). 
4.10.4.  CT-CMR/BMC positional training requirements for CRCs are included in the 
applicable RTM.  DRUs will submit unit supplements in accordance with paragraph 1.9.1 
outlining their training requirements as applicable.  (T-3) 
4.11.  Currency/Regaining Currency. 
4.11.1.  Currency.  See the RTM for currency requirements for all crew positions. 
4.11.1.1.  Positional currencies ensure crewmembers maintain a minimum level of 
proficiency in each event and the ability to safely conduct the event.  Do not perform the 
event if a crewmember loses a particular currency except for the purpose of regaining 
currency. 
4.11.1.2.  To regain/re-establish currency, accomplish events under the supervision of an 
instructor or Stan/Eval Examiner.  Instructors must be qualified/certified and current in all 
events they are instructing.  (T-3) If the instructor deems the event successful, document 
on an ACC Form 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) then the COT restores currency and 
document on the AF Form 4141. 
4.11.1.3.  Example. SSgt Smith (a CMR ICT) completed an event operation on 1 Nov.  The 
next event operation must be completed on or before 31 Dec (60 calendar days) to remain 
current or supervised by an instructor. 
4.11.1.4.  Personnel with multiple qualifications maintain currency (when applicable) for 
their applicable qualifications.  Event operations conducted in one position will not count 
in another crew position.  (T-3) 
4.11.1.5.  Events accomplished by ABMs who are certified as Section Leads (SLs) and/or 
MSOs who are certified as SSOs only need to count accomplished events once. 
4.12.  Unqualified (UQ).  UQ is the status to which the SQ/CC downgrades a qualified individual 
for failure to maintain proficiency.  The SQ/CC directs the downgrade of a CMR/BMC qualified 
individual to UQ status when the individual fails any positional evaluation, fails to complete a 
periodic evaluation by the expiration date, fails to regain currency/BMC/CMR status within 180 
calendar days, or the SQ/CC determines an individual to be non-proficient.  When an individual is 
downgraded to UQ status, one of the following occurs: 
4.12.1.  Enter the trainee into RQT in accordance with paragraph 2.4.2 as required or

supplement as applicable. 
4.14.  Multi-Qualified/Certified Personnel. 
4.14.1.  SQ/CC may multi-qualify/certify personnel who demonstrate the knowledge and 
proficiency skills required to maintain multiple CRC duty position qualifications/certifications. 
4.14.1.1.  Multi-qualified CMR/BMC personnel must achieve the performance standards 
and academic training requirements for each position, however, when the academic 
requirements are identical, they need only be accomplished once.  (T-3) 
4.14.1.2.  Upon completing an INIT QUAL for a secondary qualification, document on the 
AF Form 4141.  Additionally, ensure the documentation reflects both a primary duty 
position and all other qualifications as secondary duty positions. 
4.14.1.2.1.  A separate AF Form 4142 must be maintained for each duty position in 
which an individual holds a qualification.  (T-2) 
4.14.1.3.  For secondary qualifications, only 50% of “secondary” positional CT 
requirements must be accomplished.  (T-3) 
4.14.1.3.1.  Multiple system-qualified personnel are only required to meet CT/RAP 
training requirements as if qualified on a single system with the additional guidance 
below.   Events accumulated while TDY, to include contingency operations, may be 
logged as CT events and may count toward training cycle events.

ANG), the trainee who does not complete instructor qualification training requirements is 
referred to the SQ/CC who may grant 30-calendar days (two RSDs for ANG) extended training 
period.  If the trainee does not complete instructor qualification training requirements 
following the extended training period, the SQ/CC may remove the individual from training 
and return him/her to duty in their qualified crew position(s).  The SQ/CC may elect to enter 
the individual into instructor qualification training later. 
5.3.4.  Prerequisites.  The following prerequisites are used by the SQ/CC to nominate 
crewmembers for instructor upgrade.

MISSION TRAINING PROGRAM (MTP) 
6.1.  General.  The MTP is an integral part of the overall BMC2 training effort.  The simulation 
program provides a spectrum of training events to exercise individuals, single units, and multi-unit 
configurations in a high-fidelity virtual battlespace.  This training program utilizes a combination 
of mission training materials and a full scope of MTEs. 
6.1.1.  The MTP provides the CRC with a controlled and standardized event that can be used 
as a basis for valid assessment of mission crew performance.  It is incumbent upon commanders 
at each echelon of command to support this training activity for peak unit combat readiness. 
6.1.2.  Unit COTs are to seek out opportunities to train with BMC2 elements (airborne and 
ground) as well as other services.  Units should participate in command-sponsored exercises 
to the maximum extent possible. 
6.2.  General.  The MTE provides a way to train unit personnel either independently or in 
conjunction with other elements of the Theater Air Control System (TACS) and combat air forces.  
Through the repetitive use of MTEs, simulated scenarios are set up in a realistic interactive 
environment that develops the skills of Airmen to execute flawlessly without hesitation in 
situations likely encountered in real tactical operations. 
6.3.  Briefings and Debriefings.  Conduct MTE briefings and debriefings.

OPERATIONS TRAINING DOCUMENTATION 
8.1.  Introduction.  Documentation of academic and positional training accomplishments provide 
a current record of an individual’s training throughout their career.  This information ensures an 
accurate assessment of the individual’s currency, lookback, training cycle training requirements, 
as well as overall experience level.  Units with access to Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Learning 
Management System (LMS), or other MAJCOM-approved program will use these along with any 
unit methods to document academic and positional training accomplishments.  (T-2) 
8.2.  Operations Training Records Maintenance.  Unit DOT maintains operations training 
records for all assigned/attached 13B/1C5 personnel. 
8.3.  Forms.  This manual requires the use of AF Form 4141; refers to the AF Form 4142 which 
is prescribed by AFMAN 13-1AOC Volume 1, Ground Environment Training Air Operations 
Center (AOC); and refers to the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, which is 
prescribed by AFMAN 11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program.  
Instructions for completing these forms are contained within the electronic form and this chapter.  
In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is encouraged and authorized, to include 
use of electronic signatures and electronic permanent training records.  For units that use a system 
of record (e.g., PEX, LMS, or other MAJCOM-approved system) for tracking qualifications and 
certifications, the AF Form 4141 or AF Form 4142 generated using that system may omit items 
that are not functional in that program, if those items are tracked in the same system elsewhere and 
are available for viewing and modification by unit leadership. 
8.3.1.  AF Form 4141 (or electronic equivalent).  DOT maintains a training history on all 
operations personnel to record significant occurrences during an individual’s training.  Units 
using PEX, LMS, or other MAJCOM approved programs will use these instructions in 
conjunction with the programs’ functions to complete the AF Form 4141.  (T-2) The list of 
items entered on the AF Form 4141 are in Table A2.1.  This listing is not all-inclusive and 
may be modified to meet unit/individual requirements. 
8.3.2.  AF Form 4142 (or electronic equivalent).  DOT records accomplishment of academic 
and positional training requirements and monitored accomplishments on AF Form 4142.  Hard 
copies of the AF Form 4142, when used, are verified, authenticated, and signed by the COT. 
8.3.2.1.  DOT maintains an AF Form 4142 for the following personnel: 
8.3.2.1.1.  Assigned/attached personnel possessing a 13BXX/1C5X1/1C5X1D AFSC 
who maintain CMR/BMC qualification or certification. 
8.3.2.1.2.  A separate AF Form 4142 must be maintained for each duty 
position/qualification or certification an individual holds.  (T-2) 
8.3.2.2.  Completed AF Forms 4142 are maintained within the permanent training record 
(see paragraph 8.4.). 
 
 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
43 
8.3.3.  AF Form 8.  Stan/Eval uses this form to record evaluations; however, the COT uses it 
to certify completion of any AT requirements that result from evaluations.  The instructor 
completing the AT (or last training event if more than one) will notify the COT, or the Non-
Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) if COT is not available, that AT is complete (along 
with providing supporting mission grade sheet documentation).  (T-2) The COT or NCOIC as 
noted above will sign and date the “Date Additional Training Completed” block in Section II 
of the AF Form 8.  (T-2) Specific guidance for completing the AF Form 8 is contained in 
AFMAN 13-1 GBMC2V2. 
8.4.  Permanent Training Record.  DOT maintains a permanent training record for all assigned 
and attached personnel.  Units are authorized to maintain electronic training records to the 
maximum extent possible.  Electronic training record systems must be able to produce hard copies 
of training products, when needed, consistent with the guidance in this manual.  (T-2) 
Additionally, the electronic training record must be transportable by either digital media or via a 
digital database.  (T-2) The following guidance applies to both electronic and hard copy training 
records.  If using hard copy records, DOT uses individual 6-part folders and identifies each folder 
by typing the individual’s last name, first name, and middle initial in capital letters on a standard 
size folder label.  This label is affixed to the folder’s tab.  Folders must bear the “Controlled 
Unclassified Information” statement label/stamp on both sides of the folder.  (T-2) The training 
officer may pencil in additional information on the label (e.g., rank, crew, director designator).  Do 
not file tests or test answer sheets in hard copy folders.  Current AF Form 4141 and AF Form 4142 
may be kept in a separate binder or maintained electronically for ease of record keeping, but forms 
will be returned to the permanent training records prior to the individual’s PCS.  (T-3) 
Organization of the permanent training record is as follows: 
8.4.1.  Section I, Qualification Data.  This section contains the current copy of AF Form 
4141/Training History and AF Form 4142.  Place the AF Form 4141 on the left side and AF 
Form 4142 on the right side of Section I.  A DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, can be used to 
reflect the location of the information. 
8.4.2.  Section II, Personal History.  This section contains any other current records/documents 
pertaining to qualifications, certifications, or proficiency, to include waivers.  Within this 
section, DOT also maintains ACC Forms 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) for training 
accomplished (return to status following N-CMR/N-BMC, AT because of an evaluation, IQT 
or MQT, etc.). 
8.4.2.1.  All ACC Forms 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) will be maintained in this section 
for three years.  (T-3) Longer periods for maintaining ACC Forms 206 (or MAJCOM 
equivalent) is authorized as directed by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO. 
8.4.2.2.  System-specific task/task qualification or the computer-generated product (e.g., 
Difference training), is maintained in this section or in a database.  All information is filed 
in chronological order (with most recent on top). 
8.4.3.  Section III, Medical Qualification/Medical Waivers. 
8.4.3.1.  This section includes a current copy of the DD Form 2992 for all 13BXD and 
1C5X1D personnel, including non-sensitive DNIC status DD Form 2992 during DNIC 
period. 
44 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
8.4.3.2.  When applicable, place the AF Form 1274, Physiological Training, behind the 
current DD Form 2992. 
8.4.3.3.  In addition, medical profiles that affect operational status are filed in this section.  
Do not maintain sensitive medical history or other records of a personal medical nature in 
this file (non-waiverable). 
8.4.3.4.  If medical documentation has sensitive information, replace with a memo for 
record signed by the SQ/CC and place in this section.  After an individual is placed on 
DNIC status, DOT will keep the DD Form 2992 (or memo for record) during the DNIC 
period (30-calendar days or more) and annotate the AF Form 4141.  (T-3) 
8.4.4.  Section IV, Training History.  This section includes certificates from AETC courses, 
MAJCOM formal courses, any formal ground environment training, and other events/actions 
affecting training.  File material chronologically with the most recent on top and kept as a 
permanent part of this folder. 
8.4.5.  Section V, Miscellaneous Experience.  This section contains completed AF Form 
4141/4142 and control experience forms from other commands.  File these forms 
chronologically with the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training folder. 
8.5.  Transfer of Records. 
8.5.1.  Upon reassignment (PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment only), an individual should 
hand carry the permanent records to the gaining unit.  When circumstances prevent this, the 
losing organization will mail the records to the gaining unit via registered mail.  (T-3) When 
mailing the records or any of its contents, retain a copy (paper or electronic) until the gaining 
organization has received the original record. 
8.5.2.  If the losing and gaining units are using PEX, LMS, or other MAJCOM-approved 
program, transfer the individual’s records in accordance with the program’s parameters.  If the 
individual is PCSing to a unit that does not have PEX, LMS, or other MAJCOM-approved 
program access, print a hardcopy of the individual’s AF Form 4141, place this hardcopy in the 
six-part training folder and have the individual hand carry the folder to next unit. 
8.6.  Training Deficiency Reports (TDRs).  This paragraph prescribes the method for units to 
submit TDRs.  Units are required to provide training status in accordance with paragraph 
1.2.6.6.1. 
8.6.1.  The SQ/CC submits a TDR identifying problems beyond the unit’s ability to resolve 
that may prevent the unit or individual(s) from satisfying academic or positional training 
requirements.  TDRs identify known or potential training problems to HHQ for information 
and management purposes.  TDR identified issues are to be resolved at the lowest level of 
command.  Submit TDRs at any time during the training period. 
8.6.2.  SQ/CC should provide the following information: 
8.6.2.1.  Equipment limitations that have an impact on training (to include simulation 
equipment) 
8.6.2.2.  Lack of live, virtual, or constructive events for training 
8.6.2.3.  Lack of live and virtual events for evaluations

8.6.2.7.  Computer operations to include hardware and software problems. 
8.6.3.  Squadrons submit TDRs through their chain of command via electronic means.  Units 
should use the following format and provide sufficient detail that will lead to specific action to 
resolve the issue. 
8.6.3.1.  Title:  TDR 
8.6.3.2.  Unit:  Unit submitting the training deficiencies 
8.6.3.3.  Description of problem

8.6.3.8.  Remarks 
8.6.4.  MAJCOMs will respond to these reports within 10 calendar days of receipt, and if 
appropriate, respond with specific guidance or a plan to resolve the identified issues with 
estimated completion dates.  (T-2) 
8.7.  Letter of Qualification/Certification.  DOT is responsible for maintaining the Letter of 
Qualification/Certification document for all squadron personnel and personnel attached to the unit.  
It is a summary of qualifications and certifications of individuals within the unit and approved by 
the SQ/CC.  Letters of Qualification/Certification may be maintained in PEX, LMS, or other 
MAJCOM-approved program. 
8.7.1.  The SQ/CC may restrict a qualification/certification of a crewmember by not listing a 
qualification/certification listed in the crewmember’s training records. Example: Evaluator 
ICT (EICT) became an Evaluator AST (EAST) but was not permitted to conduct evaluations 
until more experienced. 
8.7.2.  Unit specific information contained on the Letter of Qualification/Certification will be 
outlined in the unit supplement and includes but not be limited to the following information: 
Name, rank, certification(s), duty positions (primary, secondary, etc.).  (T-3) 
8.8.  Additional Training (AT).  Any training recommended by an examiner or instructor to 
remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation that debrief cannot adequately cover. 
8.8.1.  AT may include self-study, academic instruction, and use of a L/V/C event or other 
MAJCOM-approved training device. 
8.8.2.  AT identified during an evaluation must be completed by the end of the third month 
from the completion of the last flight phase portion of the evaluation.  (T-3) 
8.8.3.  If a crewmember exceeds the allotted time for completion of AT, the SQ/CC will review 
the situation and direct appropriate action.  (T-3)

Chapter 9 
REMOVAL OF CREWMEMBERS FROM TRAINING EVALUATION BOARD (TEB) 
PROCESS/PROCEDURES 
9.1.  General . 
9.1.1.  This chapter only applies to personnel (officer and enlisted) assigned to a CRC, not 
subject to Flying Evaluation Boards outlined in AFMAN 11-402 who fail to make satisfactory 
progress in INIT QUAL, mission qualification, or CT.  The complete rights of personnel are 
contained in this chapter.  A TEB is not required for individuals in training for secondary or 
beyond qualifications. 
9.1.2.  The TEB is an administrative, fact-finding proceeding designed to ensure the quality 
control of the CRC/DRU force.  Board members examine an individual’s professional 
qualification for CRC/DRU related duties and evaluate/determine potential for use in future 
operations. 
9.2.  Policy  .  Per AFMAN 36-2100, Air Force policy is to retain and retrain only those Airmen 
who have demonstrated the ability to complete training and whose past record clearly justifies 
further training. In accordance with training syllabi elimination procedures, utilization of the 
administrative actions outlined in this chapter are based upon failure of an individual to attain a 
duty qualification, failure to re-qualify, or to maintain proficiency levels outlined in this manual.  
These procedures are not meant to replace or be used in place of punitive disciplinary action and 
are not a substitute for action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, state military law, or 
other administrative directives. 
9.3.  Training Evaluation Board (TEB) Convening Authority  .  The TEB convening authority 
is the organization at the Group level or above with the authority to direct a SQ/CC to establish a 
TEB.  The commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit conducting the 
respondent’s training has convening authority/jurisdiction for establishment of the TEB.  The 
convening authority for ACC RegAF units is the 552nd Air Control Group Commander (552 
ACG/CC).  The convening authority for ACC-gained units and for DRUs is ACC/A3C.  The 
convening authority for Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) Command and USAFE-AFAFRICA units 
are PACAF/A3/6C and USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3ZJ, respectively (notify NGB A3/10 for ANG 
personnel as applicable).  The TEB convening authority may be delegated to the SQ/CC on a case-
by-case basis by the commander’s next higher authority. 
9.3.1.  Appeal Authority.  The appeal authority for the TEB process outlined in this chapter is 
the convening authority.  In cases in which the SQ/CC is the convening authority, the appeal 
authority is the commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit 
conducting the member’s training. 
9.3.2.  Cause.  Failure of a crewmember to attain or maintain qualification in a crew position 
and/or failure to meet required standards when enrolled in an upgrade course. 
9.3.3.  Respondent.  A crewmember whose performance does not meet established standards, 
and for whom the TEB action has been requested or is being considered. 
9.3.4.  Evidence.  The information/facts presented to the TEB.  This information may include 
anything related to the individual’s training, performance, or past evaluations.  The material 
48 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
gathered by the respondent’s organization as evidence will contain a total profile of the 
individual.  (T-2) Material may be collected from any source including past assignments.  The 
student/crewmember facing possible SQ/CC action will be given the opportunity to address 
the board to provide personal insight into their training deficiencies.  (T-2) 
9.3.5.  Board Composition.  The TEB will normally be comprised of the SQ/CC (TEB Chair), 
SQ/DO, COT (Board Administrator), and Board Recorder, but may include other members as 
determined by the board chairperson.  (T-3) The unit operations superintendent will be a board 
member for enlisted personnel TEBs.  (T-3) 
9.4.  TEB Procedures.  Upon approval from the convening authority, apply the following 
guidelines: 
9.4.1.  The SQ/CC initiates the TEB process by forwarding a TEB request to the convening 
authority for review/action.  Upon approval from the convening authority, the SQ/CC 
establishing the TEB will: 
9.4.1.1.  Appoint the COT as the board administrator.  (T-3) The COT will ensure the TEB 
is established, conducted, and documented in accordance with this chapter.  (T-3) The COT 
performs the following actions: 
9.4.1.1.1.  Notify the respondent in writing of their suspension from training and 
specify the cause of the TEB. 
9.4.1.1.2.  Schedule a time and location for the TEB ensuring availability of all board 
members, the respondent, and any witnesses.  Witnesses, if unable to attend the TEB,

the syllabus defined training period or a previously approved extended training period. 
Additional training (AT)—Any training or action recommended by an examiner to remedy 
deficiencies identified during an evaluation. 
Attached personnel—Personnel not assigned to a unit’s manning document but assigned to the 
unit and maintaining a positional certification/qualification to support the attached unit’s mission.  
MAJCOM and NAF personnel are examples of attached personnel. 
Basic mission capable (BMC)—A crew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, 
is qualified in some aspect(s) of the unit mission, but does not maintain CMR status. The 
crewmember must be able to attain full qualification to meet operational taskings within 30-
calendar days.  (T-3) This status also applies to those individuals who are assigned to a unit that 
does not have a DOC tasking. BMC crewmembers do not maintain CMR status due to duty 
assignment or other reasons as determined by the appropriate authority. 
Basic qualified (BQ)—A crewmember who has satisfactorily completed IQT and is qualified to 
perform crew duties within the unit. The member must perform at the minimum frequency 
necessary to meet lookback/currency.  (T-3) 
Certification—1) Procedure used to document competency in a particular task. Not 
interchangeable with “qualification,” which requires AF Form 8 documentation. 2) A formal 
indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards. 3) The formal action 
of completing/signing documentation taken by a certification official, e.g., “the commander 
certified the AF Form 8”. 
Certification official—A SQ/CC or designate, authorized to determine an individual’s ability to 
perform a task to required standards. 
Combat mission ready (CMR)—The status of an individual who successfully completes IQT, 
MQT, and maintains qualification and proficiency in the unit combat mission. 
Continuation training (CT)—Academic and positional training required to maintain proficiency 
and improve crewmember capabilities. 
Constructive—Constructive entities simulate real world or virtual systems automatically, or 
manually driven by an operator or a white force personnel supporting distributed training that 
operate as training aids for warfighters accomplishing readiness training.  Models and simulations 
58 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
that involve simulated people operating simulated systems.  Real people stimulate (make inputs) 
to such simulations.  Constructive simulations can also be used to model natural processes without 
human involvement (e.g., weather). 
Currency—Currency is associated with specific training requirements and is a commander’s tool 
to ensure crewmembers maintain a minimum level of proficiency in each event. 
Difference training—Difference training is accomplished for crewmembers qualified in a duty 
position assigned or transferring to a CRC/DRU with specialized/unique equipment or following 
significant upgrades to the unit’s current system. 
Distributed mission operations (DMO)—A training/exercise environment that uses virtual and 
constructive entities to conduct mission training from individual operator training through LFE 
scenarios.  DMO encompass DTOC/Air Reserve Component Network/ViWS and any other DMO 
entity (e.g., Virtual Flag, FST-J). 
Distributed Training Operations Center (DTOC)—Provides daily training.  Full Spectrum 
DMO support from small-scale to large force scenarios. Most events are individually focused, but 
capable to support multi-player events with mission planning and white force support.  Current 
and qualified pilots use simulation tools and communications to replicate participating aircraft. 
Dynamic targeting—Dynamic targeting is the active process of identifying, prosecuting, and 
effectively engaging emerging targets.  The primary focus of dynamic targeting is the prosecution 
of Joint Forces Commander designated and prioritized time sensitive targeting and functional 
component-critical targets. 
Evaluation—1) The procedure to determine the effectiveness of the performance of an 
instructional product or process to ascertain specific causes for the effectiveness or lack of it, and 
to make decisions appropriate to the extent of the effectiveness. Evaluation of formal courses 
includes field evaluation and internal evaluation. 2) The review and analysis of qualitative or 
quantitative data obtained from design review, hardware inspection, testing or operational use of 
equipment. 3) The positional and written examinations used to determine proficiency as prescribed 
by governing directives. 
Event operation—A term used to describe/capture training tasks by crew position that once 
accomplished may be logged/credited toward the crewmember’s continuation training cycle or 
RAP training event requirements. 
Experienced—A category of crewmembers associated to crew position and defined by one or 
more of the following criterions: AFSC, type of qualification, amount of time the individual has 
been qualified. 
Extended training period—Training period designed for individuals who fail to progress into the 
next phase of training. 
Inexperienced—A category of crewmembers that do not meet the criterion required to establish 
experienced status. 
Initial qualification (INIT QUAL)—The first evaluation given to determine an individual’s BQ 
status. 
Instructor—Experienced CMR/BMC individual qualified to instruct the operations duties of a 
designated crew position(s). 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
59 
Initial qualification training (IQT)—Provides the training needed to qualify for basic crew 
duties in an assigned crew position without regard to the unit’s mission.  Graduates of IQT are 
awarded BQ status after successful completion of an evaluation. 
Learning Management System (LMS)—An ACC approved training management system used 
to provide online courseware and tracking of training accomplishments for the ground command 
and control units. It provides a myriad of training management reports on individual training 
accomplishments and is accessible via the internet to all users. 
Mission evaluation (MSN)—An evaluation given after MQT to certify an individual as CMR. 
Mission—For the purpose of this manual, a mission includes briefing, controlling, and debriefing. 
Briefings include training objectives.  Controlling consists of taking radio and radar control of 
aircraft and accomplishing one or more types of missions, such as counterair, Air Refueling (A/R), 
counterland, and active air defense scrambles.  Debriefing occurs with the pilots (and instructor 
where applicable).  The brief/debrief may be accomplished via telephone/radio; however, face-to-
face briefs provide optimum training. 
Mission qualification training (MQT)—Specific training designed to prepare crewmembers to 
perform duties/tasks in support of a unit mission or tasking. 
Non—combat mission ready/non-basic mission capable (N-CMR/N-BMC)—The status of a 
crewmember: 1) who failed to meet lookback; 2) who failed to complete training cycle CT/RAP 
requirements; 3) downgraded at the direction of the SQ/CC. 
Positional training—Hands-on training resulting from performance of duties in assigned 
positions. 
Proficiency—A measure of how well a task is completed.  A crewmember is considered proficient 
when they can perform tasks at acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and safety. 
Prorating—A process used to determine a crewmember’s training requirement proportionately 
based on approved consideration to include TDY (including contingency operations), medically 
disqualified/DNIC, or emergency leave status for more than 30-calendar days. 
Qualification—A status assigned to a crewmember after completion of specific positional training 
and the accomplishment of an evaluation resulting in the generation of AF Form 8 documentation. 
Ready aircrew program (RAP)—RAP is a MAJCOM specific CT program that applies to 
crewmembers.  RAP guidance is issued either by memorandum to combat coded/DOC-tasked units 
or this manual to non-combat coded units.  It is intended to focus training toward current and 
relevant combat skills.  The MAJCOM RTM provides specific positional event requirements 
outlined in Chapter 4 for combat coded units. 
Regularly schedule drill (RSD)—For the purpose of this manual, an RSD is the 2-day period per 
month ANG personnel spend on duty, the RSD is one full ANG drill weekend. 
Requalification training (RQT)—Training for crewmembers who are designated UQ. 
Tactical chat—Develop familiarization and habit patterns with Tactical Chat hardware and 
software while employing chat capability for coordination, targeting, and training TTPs. 
Training period—A specific amount of time to accomplish a prescribed phase of training. 
60 
AFMAN13-1CRCV1  23 APRIL 2024 
Training cycle—A specifically defined period associated with defining, tracking, reporting, and 
documenting continuation/RAP Training requirements.  The training cycle is defined by the RTM. 
Training device—A training platform suitable to conduct training and evaluations. 
Unqualified (UQ)—The status of an individual who: 1) Downgraded for being non-current, N-
CMR/N-BMC exceeding 180 calendar days or 2) Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability 
or 3) Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a periodic evaluation or 4) at the SQ/CC 
discretion following a commander-directed downgrade or 5) SQ/CC downgrades a qualified 
individual for failure to maintain proficiency. 
Upgrade training—Specific academic and positional training required to qualify in a 
supervisory/higher crew position that has as a prerequisite, a current/previous qualification in 
another crew position (or experience level) within the same weapon system. 
Virtual—Involves warfighters operating simulated systems.  Virtual simulations inject human- 
in-the-loop in a central role by exercising motor control skills (e.g., flying an airplane), decision 
skills (e.g., committing fire control resources to action), or communication skills (e.g., as members 
of a Command, Control Communications, Computers, and Intelligence team). 
Virtual warfighting system (ViWS)—The pilot position in a Mission Training Center that 
dynamically simulates flight characteristics.  Used for normal, emergency, and instrument 
procedures, to include safety of flight, warfighting tasks, and skill integration training (see AFI 
10-217, Management of Air Force Operational Training Systems.).
