and use JTCG/ME publications. It directs functional management for the publication of Joint Munitions
Effectiveness Manuals (JMEM) and JTCG/ME Special Reports produced by the Joint Technical Coordi-
nating Group for Munitions Effectiveness.
1. Developing JTCG/ME Publications.   Department of Defense (DoD) Components (Army, Navy, Air
Force, Marine Corps, and DIA) collaborate to develop and publish JTCG/ME documents.  The Joint
Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and DoD Components use these documents to plan and analyze attack missions,
develop weapon requirements, and conduct wargaming exercises.  The JTCG/ME operates according to
the Joint Logistics Commanders (JLC) decisions and directions.  JTCG/ME publishes all material accord-
ing to the JTCG/ME Publication Information Guide, 61JTCG/ME 1-3.
2. Responsibilities.
