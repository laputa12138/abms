Chapter 1 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND OTHER COMPLIANCE AREAS 
1.1.  Purpose.  The DAF Strategic Basing Process provides an enterprise-wide standardized, 
repeatable, transparent, and deliberate process for making DAF strategic basing decisions.  This 
instruction applies to all DAF (USAF and USSF) entities regardless of basing location and all non-
DAF entities requesting a basing action on DAF real and leased property.  The process ensures all 
strategic basing actions involving DAF units and associated missions follow environmental 
guidance, consider the overall fiscal ramifications of the proposed action and potential impacts to 
other missions, and optimize use of DAF land, facilities, infrastructure, and air space. 
1.2.  Applicability.  Only written basing decisions vetted, endorsed, and approved through the 
processes and procedures contained in this instruction are considered valid.  Questions regarding 
whether an action qualifies as a strategic basing action are referred to SAF/IEIB for final 
determination. 
1.2.1.  Overseas Basing. This instruction also applies to overseas basing actions and 
implements the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 2300.02K, 
Coordination of Overseas Force Structure Changes and Host-Nation Notification. 
1.2.2.  Organization Change Requests, Program Change Requests, Program Action Directives, 
Program Guidance Letters or Programming Plans do not constitute basing decision execution 
documents. 
1.2.3.  This instruction does not apply to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions. 
1.2.4.  Alignment of the Strategic Basing Process with other DAF corporate processes is 
detailed in Chapter 7. 
1.2.5.  Actions governed by the Testing and Evaluation (TE) process as defined in 
DODI5000.89_DAFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation, are exempt from the 
requirements of this instruction.  Actions that exceed the scope of the TE process may be 
considered DAF strategic basing actions as defined in paragraph 1.6  Coordinate with 
SAF/IEIB to determine if these actions require approval through the DAF Strategic Basing 
Structure. (T-1). 
1.2.6.  Specific DAF Strategic Basing Process exemptions are listed in Chapter 15. 
1.3.  Environmental Impact Analysis Process and Decision Making.  This instruction provides 
general National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) guidance as it relates to the Strategic Basing 
Process.  Part 989 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) implements the DAF 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP).  Details on EIAP requirements for strategic 
basing actions are identified in Chapter 14. 
1.4.  Documentation.  All strategic basing milestones shall be documented in writing.  SAF/IEIB 
is the authoritative source for all templates. (T-1). 
1.5.  Basing Action.  A basing action is any action (outlined in paragraph 1.6 below) that results 
in the establishment, increase or decrease, and/or movement of: 
1.5.1.  DAF or non-DAF units, manpower authorizations (subject to paragraph 1.6 below), 
and/or weapon systems to a location determined to be DAF real or leased property. 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
7 
1.5.2.  DAF units, manpower authorizations (subject to paragraph 1.6 below), and/or weapon 
systems to a location determined to be non-DAF real property. 
1.6.  Thresholds for Department of the Air Force Strategic Basing Actions. 
1.6.1.  A DAF strategic basing action is any basing action as defined in paragraph 1.5 and 
meets any of the criteria below. 
1.6.1.1.  Aircraft (primary aerospace-vehicle authorized) and non-aircraft weapon system 
change (mission design change IAW AFI 16-401, Designating and Naming Defense 
Military Aerospace Vehicles); excludes block/spiral upgrades and the assignment of 
Backup Aerospace Vehicle Inventory (BAI) and/or Attrition Reserve (AR) aircraft.  
Weapons systems are defined by DAFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and 
Responsibilities for Weapon Systems.  For example, recapitalizing F-16 aircraft with F-35 
aircraft is a weapon system change.  Recapitalizing F-16B42 aircraft with F-16B52 aircraft 
is not a weapon system change. 
1.6.1.2.  Any organization action (unit) that changes the number of manpower 
authorizations at an installation by at least 35 as programmed across the FYDP, including 
military authorizations, civilian authorizations, and on-base contract personnel.  See 
Attachment 1, Terms: Establishment, Organization Action, and Unit, as described in AFI 
38-101, Manpower and Organizations. 
1.6.1.3.  A unit or an establishment move.  See Attachment 1, Terms: Unit and 
Establishment as described in AFI 38-101. For the purposes of strategic basing, a “unit” is 
a squadron or larger organization. 
1.6.1.4.  A non-DAF entity requesting to move onto a DAF installation or DAF real or 
leased property, no matter the size.  Non-DAF entity exemptions are listed in Chapter 15. 
1.6.1.5.  Any action by a non-DAF entity residing on a DAF installation or DAF real or 
leased property that results in a change to their primary mission, to include any increase in 
airspace or range requirements/usage, or a change of 35 or more manpower authorizations 
or personnel (military, civilian, contractor). 
1.6.1.6.  Rotational forces requesting presence or temporary duty on a DAF installation for 
more than 300 days in an 18-month period with an increase of 35 or more personnel or 
requiring military construction. OCONUS MAJCOM exemptions are listed in para 7.5. 
1.6.1.7.  Any special interest action as identified by SAF/IEIB regardless of size or scope. 
1.6.2.  The Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority approves strategic basing actions. 
1.6.3.  Leases will be reviewed through the Strategic Basing structure (Strategic Basing Panel, 
Strategic Basing Group, and/or Strategic Basing Board) and are approved by the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI) per Air Force Mission Directive 
1-18, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations, Environment, and Energy). 
1.6.4.  Basing actions which do not meet the criteria above or are requested for a duration not 
to exceed one year are the responsibility of the host and/or lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB, 
and follow appropriate processes for approval and beddown execution, to include compliance 
with environmental laws, regulations, policy, and guidance.  Refer any question regarding 
whether an action qualifies as a strategic basing action to SAF/IEIB for final determination. 
8 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
1.7.  Resource Commitment.  Do not commit DAF funds or resources for construction, 
movement of personnel and/or equipment, or similar actions prior to a final basing decision by the 
Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority.  DAF funds and resources may be used for 
planning activity that does not preclude the choice of alternative locations. After the EIAP is 
complete per 32 CFR 989, the Secretary of the Air Force’s or delegated authority’s decision will 
be documented in the form of a signed Memorandum for Record (MFR) or Record of Decision 
(ROD). (T-0). 
1.8.  Public Announcements.  After each phase of the Strategic Basing Process is approved by 
either the Secretary of the Air Force or a delegated authority, the Secretary of the Air Force Public 
Affairs will advise whether the PA posture should be active (requiring a news release to af.mil), 
or response-to-query. The Director of Legislative Liaison will advise whether a Congressional 
Notification Plan is required. All public announcements for DAF strategic basing and 
programmatic decisions require coordination through SAF/LL, SAF/PA, and (as required) 
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management (SAF/FM). 
1.9.  Exceptions.  The five-phase process used by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) best practices, as described in Appendix XI of GAO-20-195G, will 
be considered for strategic basing when directed by Secretary of the Air Force, or delegated 
authority. In these cases, prior to the determination of basing criteria, the Director of Strategic 
Basing will recommend in writing, for Secretary of the Air Force approval, which, if any, of the 
22 GAO AoA best practices to use.

Chapter 2 
DAF STRATEGIC BASING STRUCTURE 
2.1.  Overview.  The DAF Strategic Basing Structure reviews all proposed strategic basing 
actions.  The elements of the DAF Strategic Basing Structure are the Strategic Basing Board, 
Strategic Basing Group and the Strategic Basing Panel.  This structure provides cross-functional 
perspective on all DAF strategic basing actions. 
2.2.  Secretary of the Air Force.  The Secretary of the Air Force, unless otherwise delegated, is 
the decision authority for DAF basing actions in the United States and its territories.  For overseas 
strategic basing actions, the DAF follows the process described in Chapter 11 and CJCSI 
2300.02K. 
2.3.  Strategic Basing Board.  This is the senior-level leadership forum (three-star general 
officers and civilian equivalents) dedicated to cross-functional consideration of DAF strategic 
basing actions and presents courses of action in the form of alternatives to the Secretary of the Air 
Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and/or the Chief of Space Operations.  The board reviews, 
evaluates and endorses each action to ensure consistency with DAF concepts of operations, basing 
objectives, criteria, legal requirements, policies, programming, and planning requirements.  
Members provide inputs from their core areas of responsibility and ensure proposals are fully 
vetted and are consistent with strategic guidance, precedence, and decisions.  This forum also 
returns issues requiring additional information or work to the MAJCOM, ANG, and/or USSF 
FLDCOM.  The board is chaired by the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for 
Energy, Installations, and Environment (SAF/IE).  Membership consists of the Deputy Chief of 
Staff, Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1); Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics, Engineering 
and Force Protection (AF/A4); Deputy Chief of Staff, Air Force Strategy, Integration and 
Requirements (AF/A5/7); Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Programs (AF/A8); Principal Deputy

and Appropriations Liaison (SAF/FML); the Judge Advocate General (AF/JA); Director of Public 
Affairs (SAF/PA); the Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF); SAF/IEI, and membership for 
USSF should also consist of Deputy Chief of Space Operations for Human Capital (USSF/S1); 
Deputy Chief of Space Operations for Operations, Cyber, and Nuclear (USSF/COO); Deputy 
Chief of Space Operations, Strategy, Plans, Programs, and Requirements (USSF/CSRO); and all 
other appropriate USSF representation.  Other offices and MAJCOMs/NGB/FLDCOMs may be 
added as required. 
2.4.  Strategic Basing Group.  This is the senior forum (one- and two-star general officers and 
civilian equivalents) dedicated to cross-functional synchronization of DAF strategic basing actions 
and presents courses of action in the form of alternatives to the Strategic Basing Board.  The group 
reviews, evaluates, and endorses each action to ensure consistency with DAF concepts of 
operations, basing objectives, criteria, legal requirements, policies, programming and planning 
requirements.  Members provide inputs from their core areas of responsibility and ensure proposals 
are fully vetted and are consistent with strategic guidance, precedence, and decisions.  This forum 
also returns issues requiring additional information or work to the MAJCOM, ANG, and/or USSF 
FLDCOM.  The group is chaired by SAF/IEI with Directorate of Strategy, Posture, and 
Assessments (AF/A5S) and Directorate for Strategic Plans (AF/A8X) or Directorate for Programs 
10 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023

Chapter 3 
PROCESS 
3.1.  Overview.  This section describes the strategic basing corporate review process.  For all DAF 
strategic basing actions, the proponent will first submit a Basing Action Request (BAR) to their 
respective MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB.  If a non-DAF organization contacts SAF/IEIB for a lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB assignment, the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will then initiate the 
Air Force Strategic Basing Process by submitting a BAR. 
3.2.  Strategic Basing Action Process Steps.  The DAF Strategic Basing Process is depicted in 
Attachment 2. 
3.2.1.  Strategic Basing Action Start. If the action proponent is a subordinate unit to a 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB, the proponent will work with their MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB 
basing office to submit a BAR and a draft AF Form 813, (813-O for overseas actions) Request 
for Environmental Impact Analysis with signed Section 1 (proponent description of proposed 
action and alternatives) for SAF/IEIB review and coordination with applicable SBP staff prior 
to initiation of the Strategic Basing process.  Once submitted, Section 1 of the Form 813 or 
Form 813-O may not be changed without approval of the MAJCOM CV or equivalent. Units 
that are not subordinate to a MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB should work directly with SAF/IEIB, 
who will determine a lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB to submit their BAR and an AF Form 
813, with signed Section 1 for SAF/IEIB review. 
3.2.1.1.  The MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB and/or proponent will provide their draft AF 
Form 813 and consult the Air Force Civil Engineer Center National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA) Division to determine anticipated EIAP actions to satisfy NEPA requirements.  
NGB actions will execute NEPA requirements through the NGB Environmental 
(NGB/A4A) office and will coordinate with AFCEC/CZN as required. 
3.2.1.2.  SAF/IEIB will designate the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB for all basing 
actions upon receipt of a proposed action documented in a BAR.  The lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will coordinate the BAR with appropriate agencies before 
submitting it to SAF/IEIB. 
3.2.1.3.  The phases of the basing process, in sequential order, are: 1) Enterprise Definition 
and Criteria, 2) Candidate Bases, 3) Preferred Location, and 4) Final Decision.  An Initial 
Vector Check prior to phase 1 may be required in certain circumstances. Vector Checks 
may be conducted at any point in the process. 
3.2.2.  SAF/IEIB Evaluation. Each BAR must complete all phases of the DAF Strategic Basing 
Process.  Simple, specialized, or time sensitive actions may allow consolidation of phases and 
streamline the process.  Characteristics considered in this evaluation include: (T-1). 
3.2.2.1.  Simple – an action that meets criteria for a DAF strategic basing action (reference 
paragraphs 1.5 and 1.6) and is of minimal mission and non-significant environmental 
impact on any candidate installation selected to support the requirement. 
3.2.2.2.  Specialized – an action that supports unique mission requirements which limit the 
enterprise of potential installations. 
12 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
3.2.2.3.  Time-sensitive – an action which has Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force, or Chief of Space Operations documented support (e.g., email) for an 
accelerated decision timeline.  Factors which contribute to time-sensitive basing actions 
include (but are not limited to) budgetary constraints, congressional time constraints, and 
critical mission degradation constraints. 
3.2.3.  Initial Vector Check. SAF/IEIB, in consultation with the proponent, will determine if a 
BAR requires a vector check.  This step is intended to gain Secretary of the Air Force approval 
of the strategic vision for a potential action.  The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will, in 
coordination with SAF/IEIB, prepare a presentation for the Strategic Basing Panel and 
Strategic Basing Group to review, validate, and endorse for Secretary of the Air Force decision.  
The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will incorporate the Secretary of the Air Force vector. 
(T-1). 
3.2.4.  MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB 
Endorsement. 
Lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB 
endorsement (general officer/flag officer/senior executive service official) of a BAR is 
necessary prior to formally entering the DAF Strategic Basing and Environmental Impact 
Analysis Processes.  Requests from non-DAF entities require an additional endorsement from 
the appropriate headquarter level approval authority. Candidate alternatives being considered 
shall not change without a submittal of a new AF Form 813 with supporting endorsement. (T-
1). 
3.2.5.  Enterprise Definition and Criteria Phase. 
3.2.5.1.  The MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB develops a proposed enterprise definition with a 
list of installations that meet the definition for those strategic basing actions subject to an 
enterprise-wide look (scoring).  The site survey criteria include mission, capacity, 
environmental, and cost considerations.  Additional criteria to measure NGB or AFRC 
requirements will be approved on a case-by-case basis by the decision authority. Additional 
criteria may be required to meet the guidance in 10 USC 483 and/or the conference report 
to accompany the fiscal year 2021 (FY21) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 
Section 2883.  The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB proposes initial criteria weights for 
the enterprise-wide look so a score can be determined for each basing location as 
applicable.  For strategic basing actions with a small number of installations in the 
enterprise, a phased entry into the Strategic Basing Process may be used (enter at the 
Candidate, Preferred Location, or, in rare cases, the Final Decision phase).  In these cases, 
an enterprise definition and site survey criteria are developed; no weights are assigned to 
the site survey criteria.  Site survey criteria also include mission, capacity, environmental, 
and cost considerations.  Additional criteria to comply with 10 USC 483 and the FY21 
NDAA section 2883 may also be required.  (T-1). 
3.2.5.2.  SAF/IEIB reviews and provides comment on the proposed enterprise and criteria 
prior to scheduling the basing action for the Strategic Basing Panel.  The Strategic Basing 
Panel and Strategic Basing Group will review, validate, and endorse the enterprise 
definition and criteria.  Upon receiving Strategic Basing Group endorsement, SAF/LL and 
SAF/PA will compose, respectively, the Congressional Notification Plan and Public 
Affairs Guidance as each owning directorate deems necessary. (T-1). 
3.2.5.3.  The Secretary of the Air Force, or delegated authority, approves or disapproves 
the enterprise definition and criteria. (T-1). 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
13 
3.2.5.4.  After Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority approval, SAF/IEIB, 
SAF/LL, SAF/FML, and SAF/PA will synchronize public and congressional releases if 
deemed necessary by the owning directorates. (T-1).  Following notification to the public, 
SAF/IEIB will prepare and sign the Basing Decision Memorandum (BDM), which is sent 
to the applicable MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB and proponent to inform them of the decision. 
3.2.6.  Candidate Phase. 
3.2.6.1.  MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB performs an Enterprise-Wide Look. The lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will gather and validate data from the approved enterprise 
locations, as required, and assess those installations based on the approved criteria, in 
coordination with all affected agencies and the Air Force Installation and Mission Support 
Center.  The data must reflect current conditions at the installation and be endorsed by the 
installation commander. 
3.2.6.2.  The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB submits the results of the enterprise-wide 
look to SAF/IEIB.  The Strategic Basing Panel and Strategic Basing Group will review, 
validate, and endorse the results.  SAF/LL and SAF/PA will prepare the respective 
Congressional Notification Plan and Public Affairs Guidance as each directorate deems 
necessary. (T-1). 
3.2.6.3.  After Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority approval of candidate 
locations, SAF/IEIB, SAF/LL, SAF/FML, and SAF/PA will synchronize public and 
congressional release, if deemed necessary by the owning directorates, and execute the 
plan.  The BDM or ROD is then sent to the applicable MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB and 
proponent. 
3.2.6.4.  SAF/IEIB will provide the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB and AFIMSC/IZSB a 
Site Survey Control Letter with a site Survey Control Number and the approved candidate 
location list in alphabetical order. 
3.2.6.5.  For basing actions not requiring an Enterprise-Wide Look, the Secretary of the 
Air Force or delegated authority approves the proposed enterprise definition, site survey 
criteria, and list of candidate location(s).  The rest of the Candidate Phase remains the same. 
3.2.7.  Preferred Location Phase. 
3.2.7.1.  The 
lead 
MAJCOMFLDCOM/NGB, 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
host 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB as applicable, will perform site surveys for all approved 
candidate locations.  The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will utilize pre-populated data 
from AFMISC on the Site Survey Template, identify any changes to the data, and provide 
updates to AFIMSC/IZSB. The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will forward the final site 
survey reports (reference Chapter 5) to SAF/IEIB as directed in the Site Survey 
Authorization Letter.  The site survey reports shall be submitted to SAF/IEIB no more than 
60 days after completion of the final site survey.  SAF/IEIB has ten business days to review 
and request additional information and/or clarification as needed prior to scheduling the 
Strategic Basing Panel review. (T-1). 
 
 
14 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
3.2.7.2.  After SAF/IEIB review, the site survey results are presented by the lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB to the Strategic Basing Panel and Strategic Basing Group for 
review, validation, and endorsement of the site survey results.  SAF/LL and SAF/PA will 
prepare, respectively, the Congressional Notification Plan and Public Affairs Guidance as 
each owning directorate deems necessary. 
3.2.7.3.  After Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority approval of preferred 
locations, SAF/IEIB, SAF/LL, SAF/FML, and SAF/PA will synchronize public and 
congressional release, as each owning directorate deems necessary. (T-1).  The BDM is 
then sent to the applicable MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB and proponent. 
3.2.7.4.  After required public announcement of the preferred locations, the lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will ensure the completion of the EIAP in accordance with 32 
CFR Part 989.  The lead MAJCOM/NGB/FLDCOM will staff fully coordinate public 
facing EIAP documentation with written endorsement (§3.2.4) to AF/A4C for staffing of 
AFCS security and policy reviews. (T-1). 
3.2.8.  Final Decision. 
3.2.8.1.  Immediately following the Preferred Location selection, the EIAP begins in 
earnest and the MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs/NGB shall commence conducting Site Activation 
Task Force (SATAF)s.  Upon the completion of each SATAF, a cost comparison will be 
conducted to identify any cost increases, as well as new Construction Growth Offset 
requirements. This cost comparison will include any cost growth associated with additional 
requirements not documented in the Preferred Location Phase. 
3.2.8.2.  Upon completion of the EIAP, the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will provide 
a cost comparison between Preferred Location Phase and Final Decision.  Upon review of 
the EIAP and cost comparison, the Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority 
approval of final basing decision, SAF/IEIB, SAF/LL, SAF/FML, and SAF/PA will 
synchronize public and congressional release, as each owning directorate deems necessary. 
(T-1). 
3.2.9.  The lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will not execute the DAF final strategic basing 
decision until Congressional notification is complete, if deemed necessary by SAF/LL, the 
SAF/IEIB-signed BDM or SAF/IEI-signed ROD is issued to the designated lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB (with a copy to the host MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB and 
proponent as applicable), and the designated lead and host MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB public 
release requirements are met. (T-1). 
3.2.10.  Prior to re-entry into the Strategic Basing Governance Process for the preferred 
location decision, MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB must provide a cost update, with supporting cost 
documentation, as part of the final basing decision package. If the military construction costs 
increase by 25% or $12M (whichever is higher) above the costs used in the preferred location 
decision, the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will inform the Strategic Basing Panel and 
Strategic Basing Group. The Strategic Basing Group will then determine if a recommendation 
should be made to the Secretary of the Air Force or delegated approval authority to review the 
preferred location decision. (T-1).

SITE SURVEYS 
5.1.  Site Surveys.  The appropriate MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB shall obtain a signed Site Survey 
Control Letter prior to conducting site surveys. Exemptions may be granted by SAF/IEIB in 
writing.  MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs/NGB with SAF/IEIB-endorsed enterprise, site survey criteria, 
and candidate locations may be granted site survey authorization as long as public or congressional 
notifications and/or announcements are not required.  If public or congressional notifications 
and/or announcement are required, site survey authorizations will be granted by the final approval 
authority.  The final approval authority of the enterprise and criteria resides with the SecAF or 
delegated authority.  The terms Site Survey and Site Activation Task Force are not 
interchangeable.  See Attachment 1 Terms for the definitions of Site Survey and Site Activation 
Task Force. (T-1). 
5.2.  Requesting Site Survey Control Letter.  To obtain a Site Survey Control letter, the 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB must, at a minimum, brief the BAR to the Strategic Basing Group. (T-
1). 
5.2.1.  Lead MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs/NGB receive a Site Survey Control Letter once 
congressional notification is made on the Secretary of the Air Force or delegated approval 
authority candidate list. (T-1). 
5.2.2.  Real estate actions receive Site Survey Control Letters, as required, by initiating a 
request to SAF/IEIB and providing a preliminary site plan and project concept briefing for the 
specific action. (T-1). 
5.3.  Survey Coordination.  After receiving a Site Survey Control Letter, the lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB must coordinate with the host MAJCOM(s)/FLDCOM(s)/NGB, 
AFIMSC/IZSB, and the location(s) to be surveyed.  Site surveys within the National Capital 
Region require notification and coordination with SAF/AAO. (T-1).  A coordination memorandum 
to host MAJCOMs/FLDCOMs/NGB and locations must contain the following information: 
5.3.1.  Relevant supporting documentation (i.e., BAR, required data, or feasibility study), 
which shall provide initial identification of infrastructure/environmental concerns and any 
other issues that need to be addressed before and/or during the site survey. (T-1). 
5.3.2.  Team size and point of contact, to include name and grade of senior member. (T-1). 
5.3.3.  Initial statement of support needed by the survey team during the site visit (billeting, 
transportation, etc.). (T-1). 
5.3.4.  Proposed dates for each location of the site survey. (T-1). 
5.3.5.  Exceptions to required documentation may be made on a case-by-case basis. 
5.4.  Approval Authority.  SAF/IEIB is the approval authority for all strategic basing site 
surveys, except as noted above.  Site survey approval does not constitute authority to execute DAF 
strategic basing actions, real estate related actions, construction, or expenditure of funds.  
MAJCOMs/NGB/FLDCOMs may expend funds to support early planning at approved candidate 
locations. 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023

TOTAL FORCE ENTERPRISE 
6.1.  DAF Strategic Basing Process.  The DAF Strategic Basing Process works in concert with 
the Total Force Enterprise review process and does not supersede actions or decisions outlined in 
AFI 90-1001, Planning Total Force Associations (TFAs).  SAF/IEIB will work closely with 
AF/A5S, AF/A8P, AF/A8X, AF/DSI, SF/S5/8, and SF/DS to ensure all levels of decision making 
are coordinated and the objectives of each process are achieved. In general, if a basing location is 
in question, the DAF Strategic Basing Process is used to determine the basing location. (T-1). 
6.2.  Administrative Review.  Upon administrative review, AF/DSI and/or SF/DS will inform 
SAF/IEIB of new Total Force Initiative proposals under consideration and provide information-
only briefings to the DAF Strategic Basing Structure. (T-1).

DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
Chapter 7 
STRATEGIC BASING ALIGNMENT WITH OTHER CORPORATE PROCESSES 
7.1.  Program Objective Memorandum.  Some basing decisions may be made as part of the DAF 
Corporate Structure during the Resource Allocation Plan or Program Objective Memorandum 
process.  The DAF Strategic Basing Process works in concert with the Program Objective 
Memorandum process to ensure all levels of decision making are coordinated and the objectives 
of each process are achieved.  The DAF Strategic Basing representative to the DAF Corporate 
Structure will serve as the primary conduit for advising the DAF Corporate Structure on Program 
Objective Memorandum decisions with strategic basing implications.  If a Program Objective 
Memorandum decision is made without a specified (named) location, the DAF Strategic Basing 
Process is used to determine the basing location.  If a location specification is required, AF/A8P 
and/or SF/S5/8 will issue a memorandum through SAF/IE providing the rationale for selecting the 
identified location for Secretary of the Air Force approval. In the event that the POM process 
determines a location or locations are infeasible, it shall provide a memorandum for SAF/IEI 
concurrence that identifies the rationale and selection criteria used to make that assessment and 
would not otherwise meet the purpose and need of the proposed action (T-1). 
7.1.1.  Strategic Basing Panel. AF/A8PE and/or SF/S5/8 will proactively inform SAF/IEIB of 
Program Objective Memorandum initiatives with basing implications and provide 
information-only briefings to the Strategic Basing Panel and staffing for DAF Strategic Basing 
Structure documentation as required. (T-1). 
7.1.2.  Technical Guidance. AF/A8PE and/or SF/S5/8 will issue technical guidance in support 
of actions that would otherwise trigger the DAF Strategic Basing Process. (T-1). 
7.1.3.  If a basing decision may be made as part of the Air Force Corporate Structure during 
the Program Objective memorandum process, the basing decision must obtain supporting 
NEPA and related documentation. 
7.2.  Air Reserve Component.  All strategic basing actions that affect Air National Guard, Air 
Force Reserve units or installations also require compliance with DoDI 1225.08. (T-1). 
7.3.  National Capital Region (NCR) Basing.  Any basing action, regardless of size, which takes 
place within 100 miles of the Pentagon is subject to the National Capital Planning Act set forth at 
40 USC §8701 et seq., DoDI 5305.5, Space Management Procedures for the National Capital 
Region (NCR), AFI 32-9010, and Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Land Acquisition and 
Leasing of Office Space in the United States, in addition to the terms and conditions set forth in 
this instruction.  No proposals for relocating into or within the National Capital Region that exceed 
$500,000 in relocation costs may be made public without Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary 
of Defense approval. (T-0). 
7.4.  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics 
(SAF/AQ) Basing Actions.  In line with HAF Mission Directive 1-10 Assistant Secretary of the 
Air Force (Acquisition) and AFI 63-101/20-101, responsibilities for SAF/AQ basing actions 
include government-owned, contractor operated facilities and Depot Source of Repair actions. 
SAF/AQ will provide informational briefs to the DAF Strategic Basing Structure that would 
otherwise be strategic basing decisions as defined in Chapter 1 and triggered by AFI 63-101/20-
101. 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
29 
7.5.  Global Force Management Allocation Plan.  Global Force Management Plan allocations 
follow a separate corporate process.  Working in concert with Joint Publication 3-35, Deployment 
and Redeployment Operations, this instruction describes the use of continuous rotation forces not 
apportioned by Global Force Management Plan allocations.  If positioning forces within the area 
of responsibility are listed in the Global Force Management Plan allocations with an assigned 
location even for more than one year, the host MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will provide a 
memorandum through SAF/IEI providing the rationale for proceeding without going through the 
DAF Strategic Basing Process.  If Global Force Management Allocation Plan forces become 
permanent, and/or are no longer directed in the Global Force Management Plan allocations, the 
action will follow the DAF Strategic Basing Process to inform the Secretary of the Air Force 
recommendation to the Secretary of Defense for permanent basing. (T-1).

DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
Chapter 8 
UNCOVERED/UNEARNED MANPOWER ACTIONS 
8.1.  SAF/IE will inform the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and/or 
Chief of Space Operations of any potential uncovered or unearned manpower resulting from 
a strategic basing action.  This information will be presented as an Initial Vector Check to the 
Secretary of the Air Force who will determine if a basing decision is necessary, and if so, the 
Strategic Basing Process entry phase.  If the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air 
Force, and/or Chief of Space Operations determine the disconnected or uncovered manpower 
action is time-sensitive, an O-6 level Tiger Team, led by SAF/IEIB, will convene.  The Tiger Team 
will develop a course, or courses, of action list to address the disconnected or uncovered 
manpower.  If the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and/or Chief of Space 
Operations determine the action is not time-critical, then the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will 
follow the DAF Strategic Basing Process for the determination of any secondary mission(s).  This 
instruction does not supersede existing manpower management policy as specified in AFI 38-101, 
Manpower and Organization.  See Attachment 1 Terms for the definition of disconnected and 
uncovered manpower. (T-1). 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023

Chapter 9 
REAL ESTATE ACTIONS 
9.1.  Estate Actions.  The DAF Strategic Basing Process works in concert with the real estate 
process and does not supersede actions outlined in the 32-9000 series of DAF instructions and Air 
Force Civil Engineer Center procedures dealing with real property management.  The Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations and Environment (SAF/IE) has overall 
responsibility and oversight of DAF-controlled real property.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI) provides DAF real property policy, approvals, and 
oversight guidance as delegated by SAF/IE.  Actions include licenses, permits, and easements.  
Certain real estate actions described in Chapter 15 are exempt from the DAF Strategic Basing 
Process. (T-1). 
9.2.  Strategic Basing Panel and Strategic Basing Group.  Once a real estate action is forwarded 
to SAF/IEI for approval, SAF/IEI will include SAF/IEIB on the DAF coordination of major actions 
as determined by SAF/IEI.  Information in the real estate action is used to provide informational 
briefings to the Strategic Basing Panel and the Strategic Basing Group by the Air Force Civil 
Engineer Center. (T-1). 
9.3.  Real Estate Survey Control Letter.  SAF/IEIB will accept a draft feasibility study, 
preliminary site development plans, or like documents, except when the DAF Strategic Basing 
Process requires additional information for issuance of a Site Survey Control Letter. SAF/IEIB 
will notify the requestor when additional information is necessary. (T-1).

DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
Chapter 10 
JOINT BASES 
10.1.  Joint Bases.  DAF units must follow the DAF Strategic Basing Process when considering a 
DAF strategic basing action at a joint base or joint region location.  Non-DAF entities follow 
Chapter 12. (T-1).  Joint Reserve Bases are defined as having facilities used by two or more 
reserve components (see 10 USC §§ 18231 - 18240) and are not considered Joint Bases as defined 
in this chapter. 
10.2.  DAF Supporting Component.  If the Air Force is the supporting component, the proponent 
(i.e., supported and non-supported tenants) must submit a BAR through the appropriate lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB (Chapter 3) to SAF/IEIB to initiate the DAF Strategic Basing 
Process.  The requestor will identify the Total Obligation Authority including estimated support 
requirements (manpower authorizations, costs, etc.) for the basing action. (T-1). 
10.2.1.  The proponent must follow the process as outlined in paragraphs 3.2 or 3.3 and comply 
with the EIAP. (T-1). 
10.2.2.  The proponent must document Intermediate Command Summit support for the 
strategic basing action (Joint Management Oversight Structure). (T-1). 
10.3.  DAF Supported Component.  If the DAF is the supported component, the requestor will 
identify the Total Obligation Authority being transferred from the DAF to the supporting 
component including the estimated number of support manpower authorizations and costs for 
installation support services to support the basing actions. (T-1). 
10.4.  Basing 
Action 
Approval.  Upon 
basing 
action 
approval, 
the 
requesting 
organization/MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB must comply with all Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) guidance and related DoDIs for basing and inter/intra-
service support including the DoD Memorandum, Department of Defense Supplemental Guidance 
for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base - New Mission Stationing/Beddown. (T-1).

Chapter 11 
OVERSEAS BASING 
11.1.  General.  In compliance with CJCSI 2300.02K, DAF and non-DAF entities requesting a 
basing action on a DAF installation will use this section for basing decisions outside the United 
States, U.S. territories and possessions.  This process is designed to inform the Secretary of the Air 
Force on a proposed location for an overseas basing action.  This becomes the DAF position that 
is coordinated in accordance with Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense guidance for 
required approval, per Title 10, Section 162. (T-0). 
11.1.1.  Strategic Basing Action. Any action requiring an Overseas Force Structure Change 
and meeting the criteria in paragraph 1.6 for a strategic basing action. An Overseas Force 
Structure Change that meets criteria in para 1.6 will be staffed as part of the BAR. 
11.1.2.  Resource Commitment. No commitment of DAF resources, construction, or 
movement of personnel and/or equipment may occur on an installation prior to Overseas Force 
Structure Change approval and completion of Host Nation Notification, as required.  This 
prohibition does not apply to planning processes. 
11.2.  Policy. 
11.2.1.  When the Secretary of Defense approves a broad posture concept/plan, but the 
requested Overseas Force Structure Change covers specific realignments or locations which 
may not have been named as part of the broad change, the specific realignment requires 
Secretary of Defense approval. (T-0). 
11.2.2.  CJCSI 2300.02K establishes the thresholds and the process for submitting an Overseas 
Force Structure Change proposal and Host Nation Notifications. 
11.3.  Process. 
11.3.1.  Overview. The DAF Strategic Basing Structure provides for the DAF approval of all 
basing actions.  All strategic basing actions require the submission of a BAR to SAF/IEIB and 
will follow the DAF Strategic Basing Process. 
11.3.2.  Process Steps. Basing actions requiring Headquarters DAF approval will use the 
Strategic Basing Process as per this instruction. 
11.4.  Lead Major Command/FLDCOM/NGB Responsibilities.  In addition to coordinating 
approval of a basing action through the DAF Strategic Basing Structure, the lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will also coordinate, as required, with the Geographic and Functional 
Combatant Commanders.  This applies to all Overseas Force Structure Change proposals on DAF 
bases or changing DAF manning structures no matter the size, Host Nation Notification 
coordination, and proposed installation realignments.  Formal and informal Combatant 
Commander coordination may be appropriate at varying points in the basing process to include 
defining basing/site survey criteria, identifying installations that should be included in the 
enterprise-wide application of criteria, and in the application of strategic alignment.  Combatant 
Commands can also be tasked for input and coordination by the Joint Staff after the DAF 
submission of an Overseas Force Structure Change proposal. (T-1). 
34 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
11.5.  Classification.  Overseas basing actions are classified Confidential or higher, in accordance 
with CJCSI 2300.02K, as appropriate.  The geographic combatant command, in coordination with 
the Department of State/American Embassy, will declassify selected Overseas Force Structure 
Change information at a specified date, normally 30 days after Host Nation Notification is 
complete.  The appropriate classification also applies to site surveys and environmental analysis 
related to the basing action. (T-1). 
11.6.  Environmental Impact Analysis Process Responsibility.  The proponent (typically within 
the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM) of a basing action is responsible for complying with, initiating, and 
funding the EIAP as outlined in Chapter 14 of this instruction per 32 CFR Part 989 and 32 CFR 
Part 187, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions, current edition 
and AFI 32-7091, Environmental Management Outside the United States.  Integration of the EIAP 
during the initial planning stages of proposed strategic basing actions will ensure planning and 
decisions reflect environmental requirements. (T-0). 
11.7.  Realignments. 
11.7.1.  A realignment, in accordance with DoDI 4165.69, Realignment of DoD Sites 
Overseas, is the return, or partial return, of overseas sites operated or maintained by United 
States personnel or forces to host nation control.  It also applies to the conversion to standby 
status of overseas sites operated or maintained by the United States. 
11.7.2.  Proposals for realignment may involve an Overseas Force Structure Change or may 
simply be a real estate action requiring Host Nation Notification.  The lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM will coordinate with SAF/IEIB to determine if a proposed realignment 
constitutes a basing action. (T-1).

assist the non-DAF entity in navigating the DAF’s Strategic Basing Process and defining criteria 
to allow an enterprise-wide look.  The MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB will coordinate the BAR. (T-
1). 
12.3.  Strategic Basing Process.  When the BAR is approved to enter the DAF Strategic Basing 
Process, non-DAF entities will follow the same strategic basing procedures and requirements as 
DAF entities and will receive a Site Survey Control Letter.  A Basing Decision Memorandum or 
Record of Decision will reflect the Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority approval of 
the strategic basing action and authorize the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB to allow the non-
DAF entity to execute their action.  The non-DAF entity is responsible for completing required 
congressional notifications and public affairs announcements in collaboration with the lead and 
host MAJCOM(s)/FLDCOM(s)/NGB.  Support requirements are to be negotiated with the host 
installation or MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB through a Memorandum of Agreement.  Services 
should refer to DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements and AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, 
and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures. (T-1). 
12.4.  National Environmental Policy Act.  The non-DAF entity is responsible for its own 
National Environmental Policy Act compliance; the DAF does not, and should not, be their 
Environmental Planning Function.  They must follow (at a minimum) 32 CFR §989.7 “Requests 
from Non-Air Force Agencies or Entities.”  As the Proponent of the action, non-DAF entities will 
establish a cooperating agency relationship with the DAF and fully consider non-DAF siting 
alternatives at the earliest possible time and include this information in the BAR submittal (see 
Chapter 14). 
12.5.  Public Education.  Public schools, universities, and non-DAF education activities follow 
the non-DAF entity process. (T-1).

DAF ENTITIES ONTO NON-DAF INSTALLATIONS 
13.1.  DAF entities requesting to move onto non-DAF installations, to include leased 
space.  Shall follow the DAF Strategic Basing Process as outlined in Chapter 3 to obtain Secretary 
of the Air Force or delegated authority approval.  The proponent’s designated lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB is required to submit a BAR to SAF/IEIB and receive DAF approval 
prior to submitting requests, conducting site surveys, or actively pursuing basing options on non-
DAF, Department of Defense property.  SAF/IEIB will coordinate requests with the proponent, 
lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB, Headquarters DAF, and the real property owner to provide the 
proponent/lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB with a basing decision.  The proponent should address 
the reasons for needing to be located on a non-DAF installation and the additional costs to the 
DAF if approved.  If movement onto a non-DAF installation is approved by the Secretary of the 
Air Force or delegated authority, the proponent will be required to follow the host-Service basing 
process.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS 
PROCESS 
14.1.  Department of the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process.  The proponent 
(typically the lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB) of a DAF strategic basing action is responsible for 
initiating, complying with, and funding the EIAP (32 CFR Part 989.3(d)).  The lead 
MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB coordinates and works with the Environmental Planning Function, 
normally at base level, for routine proposals and on behalf of tenant organizations.  The Air Force 
Civil Engineering Center provides DAF execution support for Strategic Basing Environmental 
Impact Statements Environmental Assessments.  All DAF strategic basing action information 
released to the public as part of the EIAP is coordinated with AF/A4CP and/or NGB/A4 and/or 
SF/COO, and approved through SAF/IEIB.  Approval for public release is made once all the 
coordination through DAF senior leaders, SAF/LL, SAF/FML, and SAF/PA, and proper 
notifications are completed. (T-1) 
14.2.  Procedures.  The DAF implements the environmental analysis process as promulgated in 
32 CFR Part 989.  The DAF Proponent and non-DAF entity follow 32 CFR Part 989 to fully 
comply with the EIAP. (T-0).  Early coordination between the Environmental Planning Function 
and the Proponent is accomplished to ensure integration of the EIAP during the initial planning 
stages of proposed basing actions and BAR preparation. (T-1). 
14.2.1.  Proponents are responsible for ensuring the EIAP is properly timed and completed for 
proposed actions and their alternatives to reduce delay by integrating the National 
Environmental Policy Act process into early planning.  Proponents will ensure basing requests 
reflect all essential information on how they comply with the DAF’s EIAP.  Proponents will 
coordinate the purpose and need for the proposed action with their Environmental Planning 
Function, which is reflected in their BAR submittal. (T-1). 
14.2.2.  The AF Form 813 or AF Form 813-O is used to initiate the EIAP and a copy is sent to 
SAF/IEIB along with the BAR with an anticipated EIAP key milestones and completion dates.  
The AF Form 813 or AF Form 813-O presents the Purpose and Need for the proposed action 
as well as the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives.  All EIAP documentation will 
be provided to Headquarters DAF for review, coordination, and approval in pre-draft and pre-
final form. (T-1). 
14.2.3.  Non-DAF entities are responsible for their own compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act and other regulatory issues.  Early coordination with the DAF, prior 
to BAR submittal, is required.  Non-DAF entities work in partnership with the DAF to 
determine (32 CFR § 989.7) how to collaboratively accomplish National Environmental Policy 
Act compliance and establish a Cooperating Agency relationship. 
14.3.  Environmental Baseline Survey.  Proponents will comply with AFI 32-7020, 
Environmental Restoration Program. (T-1).

Active Duty Air Force—Active duty Air Force is full-time duty in the active military service of 
the United States Air Force.  This includes members of the Reserve Components serving on active 
duty or full-time training duty but does not include full-time National Guard duty. 
Basing—The process used to determine the location of a unit, mission, activity, or manpower.  
Basing involves actions taken to position DAF units (on DAF or non-DAF property) or non-DAF 
entities on DAF real property. 
44 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
Basing Action—–Movement of DAF or non-DAF units, missions, manpower authorizations, 
and/or weapon systems to a location determined to be DAF real property to include leased space. 
Basing Action Request (BAR)—The formal request submitted to initiate the DAF Strategic 
Basing Process.  The proponent of a proposed basing action will complete and submit the request 
to SAF/IEIB. 
Beddown—The execution of a Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority-approved basing 
action establishing a unit, mission, activity, or manpower on DAF real property or a DAF unit, 
mission, activity, or manpower on non-DAF DoD Component or foreign military installations for 
longer than one year.  This applies to activities of all military branches, other DoD agencies, non-
DoD federal, state, and local governmental agencies, and/or private agencies requesting the use of 
DAF real property. 
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)—The process under Public Law (PL) 100-526 (BRAC 
88) and PL 101-510 that the DoD has used to reorganize its installation infrastructure to more 
efficiently and effectively support its force structure, increase operational readiness, and facilitate 
new ways of doing business through closure and/or realignment of bases where actions exceed 
thresholds established in 10 United States Code (USC) § 2687. 
Block/Spirals—Incremental builds of a weapons system 
Construction Growth Offset—All building square footage growth, whether due to MILCON, 
UMMC or FSRM, must be offset by either a funded disposal action (i.e., demo or transfer) or by 
identifying facilities entered into a CLSD operational status. 
Contingency—Per JP 4-04, an emergency, event, or series of events involving military forces 
caused by natural or human disasters, terrorists, subversives, international instabilities or by 
required military operations.  Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies require plans, 
rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, installations 
and equipment. 
Continental United States—The contiguous United States territory, including the adjacent 
territorial waters, located within North America between Canada and Mexico. 
Department of the Air Force Real Property—Any right, title, or interest in land, buildings, fixed 
improvements, utilities, and other permanent additions to land.  Examples include equipment 
attached to, and made part of, buildings and structures (such as heating systems), but not movable 
equipment (such as plant equipment). 
Department of the Air Force Strategic Basing Process—The process the DAF uses to determine 
the location of a unit, mission, activity, or manpower. 
Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA)—Attached to an AF Form 813, 
Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, initiates the required assessment of environmental 
impacts associated with proposed program actions as mandated by the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190).  The AF Form 813 contains two main elements: the Purpose and 
Need for the Action and the DOPAA.  The AF Form 813 identifies the need for the proposed 
action, defines the scope of the action, discusses reasonable alternatives, and helps in determining 
the appropriate level of environmental analysis required. 
 
 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
45 
Enterprise—The enterprise of installations is comprised of all Active Duty (or Regular) Air 
Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and United States Space Force major and minor 
installations as defined in AFPD 10-5, Basing.  The DAF enterprise also includes DAF-supported 
joint bases and other sites greater than 50 acres where the DAF owns the underlying land (i.e., 
missile sites, DAF- owned contractor-operated plants).  The enterprise may also include other DoD 
Component and/or foreign military installations. 
Enterprise-Wide Look (EWL)—The process of applying the basing criteria developed by the 
proponent and approved by the Secretary of the Air Force or delegated authority to score DoD 
Component and/or foreign military installations and sites worldwide.  The enterprise ultimately is 
dependent on operational requirements and the nature of the mission being evaluated for basing.  
Once the locations have been quantitatively evaluated against the Secretary of the Air Force or 
delegated authority-approved basing criteria, the Strategic Basing Panel will meet to review the 
findings to produce a ranked potential candidate list.  When the candidate list is endorsed by the 
Strategic Basing Group and/or approved by the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force, and/or the Chief of Space Operations, these locations are eligible for site survey 
requests and are subject to the EIAP as a reasonable range of alternatives for the proposed basing 
action.  This deliberate process should produce repeatable and consistent results. 
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 requires analysis of the environmental effects of major federal actions and is promulgated at 
32 CFR Part 989.  32 CFR 989 governs DAF National Environmental Policy Act compliance for 
installations in the United States and its territories and overseas. 
Environmental Planning Function (EPF)—The environmental office or unit that manages the 
EIAP in support of the proponent for implementation of the action.  Duties can include completion 
of EPF portions of the AF Form 813, review and application of categorical exclusions, facilitation 
of the Planning Requirement in the EIAP, support for DOPAA development, identification of an 
interdisciplinary team, and management of the EIAP and contract for completing analyses and 
required documentation.  AFCEC/CZN is the EPF for all Environmental Impact Statements and 
high profile Environmental Assessments. 
Establishment—An organizational entity consisting of a headquarters unit and its subordinate 
units.  The name of the establishment is in the name of the headquarters unit.  For example, Air 
Mobility Command (AMC) is an establishment; HQ AMC is its headquarters.  Subordinate units 
are assigned to the establishment and not to the headquarters unit.  Reference AFI 38-101, 
Manpower and Organization. 
Host Command—The Air Force Major Command(s) or Space Force FLDCOM(s) owning the 
installation(s) affected by a proposed basing action (e.g., affected by site surveys (Enterprise-Wide 
Look), by the EIAP, and/or by a Site Activation Task Force for beddown execution).  Also includes 
the Air Force Major Command or Space Force FLDCOM that is the proponent for a DAF mission 
seeking to beddown on non-DAF real estate. 
Industrial Facility—Any DAF-owned, -leased, or -controlled real property facility that a 
contractor uses to perform Government research, development, test, evaluation, production, 
maintenance, or modification or to store production machinery and equipment in support of such 
activity. 
46 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
Installation—Any United States Department of Defense, or other Federal Department or Agency, 
or foreign military base or location capable of supporting military missions. 
Lead MAJCOM/FLDCOM/NGB—The Air Force Major Command, Space Force FLDCOM, or 
other entity as designated by SAF/IEIB per paragraph 3.2.1 to champion a proposed basing action 
through the DAF Strategic Basing Process from initial BAR submission through beddown. 
Mission—A duty assigned to an establishment, unit or non-unit. 
Non-DAF Real Property—Real property not owned or managed by the Department of the Air 
Force. 
Non-DAF Entity—Any unit, group, or organization not part of the DAF (e.g., private, 
commercial, non-profit, local government, state government, federal government, or Service other 
than Air Force). 
Organization Action—Reference Chapter 27 of AFI 38-101 for a description of organization 
terminology and procedures.  With respect to strategic basing, if an organization action/event 
entails activation, inactivation, designation, re-designation, or assignment of an organization entity 
(unit) that changes the number of DAF controlled positions at an installation by at least 35 
positions, this action/event must be vetted through the DAF Strategic Basing Process.  Manpower 
actions (e.g., application of new logistics composite model or manpower determinant, Office of 
the Secretary of Defense or DAF Corporate Structure program adjustments, etc.) that affect the 
number of DAF positions at an installation are not subject to this instruction. 
Organization Change Request—A request for an organization action, such as unit activation, 
inactivation, re-designation, or variation, to a standard structure as depicted in AFI 38-101. 
Outgrant Lease—A conveyance of an exclusive, possessory interest in non-excess, DAF- 
controlled real property pursuant to the authority of 10 USC § 2667 offered in exchange for 
consideration equal to or greater than the property’s fair market value in cash or in kind. 
Outside of the Continental United States—Outside the contiguous United States to include 
Alaska, Hawaii, and all other countries. 
Planning Requirements in the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (PREIAP)—
Emphasizes early interdisciplinary planning and promotes coordinated and consistent 
implementation of repeatable processes to achieve timely decisions on DAF action proposals. 
Positioning Forces—Placement of military personnel in a location to manage crisis and prevent 
war or defeat an enemy in war. 
Programming Plan (PPlan)—A directive, coordinated document consisting of a Basic Plan and 
supporting functional staff annexes which defines the actions required and outlines the 
responsibilities for achieving a given program objective.  The primary types of actions for which 
PPlans are developed include unit activations and in-activations; realignments involving the 
physical move of people or assets; base closures; beddown of weapon systems; unit conversions 
from one weapon system to another; beddown and/or integration of specialized systems or unique 
organizational constructs; and increases or decreases in a unit's Primary Aerospace Vehicle 
inventory. 
 
 
DAFI10-503  12 JUNE 2023 
47 
Programming Message (PMsg)—May be used in lieu of a PPlan when less comprehensive 
documentation will suffice to implement a program objective.  For example, PMsgs are often used 
when limited functional involvement is required to execute the action.  PMsgs may also be used 
as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide basic guidance pertaining to a major 
program action while more comprehensive documentation is being developed.  This is the method 
of choice when planning time is limited. 
Program Action Directive (PAD)—Generated at the Headquarters, Department of the Air force 
(HAF), PADs are used to direct Major Command or FLDCOM development of PPlans/PMsgs for 
program actions already in the President's Budget (PB) or which are to be worked into the PB 
through standard processes. 
Program Change Request (PCR)—A tool submitted by the Air Staff or Space Staff through 
AF/A8PE or a Major Command/FLDCOM, which is used to initiate proposed out-of-cycle 
changes to programs contained in the President’s Budget (PB).  DAF program actions are 
authorized by the PB.  Formulation of the PB is a cyclic process. 
Program Guidance Letters—A formal planning document that establishes direction, assigns 
tasks, and provides guidance (i.e., Morale, Welfare, Recreation/Services integration, or Civil Air 
Patrol reorganization). 
Program Objective Memorandum (POM)—The final product of the programming process 
within the DoD, the Components’ POM displays the resource allocation decisions of the Military 
Departments in responding to and in accordance with Defense guidance.  
Proponent—The office, unit, or activity at any level that initiates a DAF basing action. 
Resource Allocation Plan (RAP)—The 30-year force structure and funding allocation plan for 
Air Force and Space Force Total Obligation Authority (TOA).  The RAP is organized as a fiscally 
constrained and risk informed effects-based capability portfolio. 
Site Activation Task Force (SATAF)—A team of Major Command/NGB/FLDCOM functional 
experts chartered to travel to an installation to identify all the actions required to ensure the 
Secretary of the Air Force approved final basing decision is successfully executed at an installation 
after completion of the DAF Strategic Basing Process.  SATAFs are led by a Major 
Command/NGB/FLDCOM, and provide periodic, on-scene assistance to unit-level agencies to 
accomplish a program objective.  They employ appropriate members of the Major 
Command/NGB/FLDCOM staff and may include Headquarters DAF functionals.  The SATAF 
structure is comprised of headquarters team members and representation from the affected unit(s), 
which are organized into functional working groups.  Each working group has an assigned 
chairperson who functions under the direction of the SATAF Team Chief.  A SATAF may be 
convened to support bringing a program, system, equipment and/or site to operational readiness.  
SATAFs are also conducted to facilitate unit activations, inactivations, relocations, and 
conversions from one weapons system to another. 
Site Survey—An authorized installation visit by an individual or team to survey real property to 
determine its feasibility for a proposed unit or mission beddown for Secretary of the Air Force 
approval during the DAF Strategic Basing Process.

Site Visit Authorization—A visit to a site, installation, or location to perform operational or 
managerial assessment activities.  Examples include oversight of programs, grant operations or 
management activities for internal control purposes; carry out an audit, inspection or repair 
activity; conduct negotiations; provide instructions; and provide technical assistance.  For purposes 
of this instruction, this definition is augmented to include an informal visit to a site to gather 
preliminary information unrelated to a specific basing action(s).  Unit commanders and 
headquarters agencies are not restricted from making contact with other Major 
Commands/NGB/FLDCOMs as part of the site visit planning process. 
Strategic Alignment—The degree to which a strategic basing proposal complies with the National 
Security Strategy and/or the National Defense Strategy. 
Strategic Basing—Basing relating to the identification of long-term or overall aims and interests 
of the DAF. 
Strategic Basing Panel—A panel (O-6 and civilian equivalents) that supports the Strategic Basing 
Group and senior-level leadership as a forum for initial corporate review and evaluation of 
appropriate basing issues. 
Strategic Basing Group—The senior forum (one- and two-star general officers and civilian 
equivalents) dedicated to cross-functional consideration of DAF strategic basing actions.  Presents 
courses of action in the form of alternatives to the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force, and/or the Chief of Space Operations through the Air Force Corporate Structure. 
Uncovered Manpower—A situation that arises when a DAF mission (e.g., weapon system, 
manpower positions, etc.) moves from one location to another, is reduced, or is eliminated, leaving 
the existing manpower at the losing location without a mission.  Being without a mission, the 
affected manpower is considered uncovered.  Although rare and most common among the Reserve 
Component, an uncovered manpower situation is possible at any location where a DAF mission 
exists. 
Unearned Manpower—Manpower Authorizations (Unit Manpower Document) and/or End 
Strength (FYDP) resources that are deliberately disconnected from a requirement, organization, or 
mission realigned to implement a Strategic Basing decision.  Manpower that is not moved with a 
realigned requirement and connected to another or new requirement is a disconnected resource. 
Unit—A military organization constituted by Headquarters DAF or designated by a Major 
Command, FLDCOM, the National Guard Bureau, Field Operating Agency or Direct Reporting 
Unit (for provisional units) of squadron size (or equivalent) or larger.  Non-units are those entities 
that are not constituted by the Headquarters DAF, such as a Named Activity, Detachment, 
Operating Location, Squadron Section, Commanders Support Staff, or Air Force Element. 
U.S. Territories—Territories associated with, or administered by, the United States Government, 
including but not limited to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, Johnston Atoll, Midway Island, Virgin Islands, 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and Wake Island.
