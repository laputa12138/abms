AIR FORCE NUCLEAR MISSION GOVERNING BODIES 
A2.1.  Air Force Nuclear Mission Governance Structure.  The major deliberative bodies of 
the Air Force Nuclear Mission Governance Structure include the NOB and the NIRI. 
A2.2.  Nuclear Oversight Board (NOB).  Co-chaired by the SecAF and the CSAF and 
comprising MAJCOM commanders and other designated members, the NOB provides senior-
level executive oversight and strategic direction to the Air Force nuclear mission.  The NOB is 
the primary forum for Air Force nuclear mission issues related to policy, national strategy 
implementation, organization, assessments, and strategic communications.  The NOB resolves 
Air Force nuclear mission issues and ensures senior-level stewardship of the Air Force nuclear 
mission. 
A2.2.1.  As the NOB Secretariat, AF/A10 will: 
A2.2.1.1.  Work with MAJCOM commanders and HAF two-letters to identify, discuss, 
vet, and resolve issues and/or impacts on the Air Force nuclear mission stemming from 
evolving national policies, strategies, studies, and reviews. 
A2.2.1.2.  Task and track issues and/or actions to appropriate Air Force organizations. 
A2.2.1.3.  Charter and chair the NIRI. 
A2.2.2.  Guidelines.  The NOB will meet at least three times each calendar year or as 
directed by the SecAF/CSAF.  When practical, meetings will be held in conjunction with 
CORONA or other four-star forums. 
A2.2.3.  NOB invitees are by name.  If unable to attend, a named invitee may nominate a 
general officer or civilian equivalent for SecAF/CSAF approval.  Following SecAF/CSAF 
approval prior to the NOB, invitees will present their respective briefings.  Approved subject 
matter experts will be present only for their briefing and will depart upon completion. 
A2.3.  Nuclear Issues Resolution and Integration Board (NIRI).  Chaired by AF/A10, the 
NIRI provides senior-level Air Force oversight and strategic direction to resolve key issues 
affecting the Air Force nuclear mission.  The NIRI brings decision-quality issues to the NOB to 
address issues and implements direction from the SecAF and the CSAF.  HAF deputy two-
letters, MAJCOM vice commanders, and others as designated comprise the NIRI.  AFGSC, as a 
Service component of USSTRATCOM, and USAFE, as a Service component of USEUCOM, 
will brief the NIRI on issues affecting their areas of responsibility. 
A2.3.1.  The NIRI addresses issues arising from Air Force nuclear mission assessments, 
nuclear-related boards, commissions, panels, task forces, or similar groups, and oversees 
implementation of direction and guidance given by the SecAF and the CSAF. 
A2.3.2.  Guidelines. 
A2.3.2.1.  The NIRI charter specifies that the board should meet at least quarterly and as 
directed by AF/A10. 
A2.3.2.2.  AF/A10 may invite other Air Force, DoD, or Interagency organizations as 
“special invitees” on a case-by-case basis.  A general officer or civilian equivalent must 
represent these organizations.

KEY FUNCTIONS OF THE AIR FORCE NUCLEAR MISSION 
A3.1.  Key Functions. 
A3.1.1.  Human Capital Development.  The Air Force provides combat capabilities and 
technical expertise for the planning, employment, and execution of the nuclear mission on 
behalf of CCDRs. These trained, certified, and combat-ready forces conduct nuclear 
operations, maintenance, sustainment, security, and support functions.  Through Service-
wide development of the force via training, education, assignments, exercises, and 
evaluations, the Air Force sustains nuclear expertise and a culture of excellence throughout 
the nuclear mission.  To successfully execute the nuclear mission and maintain nuclear 
surety, the Air Force will fill key leadership positions of high-level responsibility with 
personnel appropriately trained and qualified in the nuclear mission. 
A3.2.  Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications.  Nuclear command, control, and 
communications provide the capability through which Presidential authority for employment and 
termination of nuclear weapons operations is exercised and operational command and control 
over U.S. nuclear forces is conducted.  AFI 13-550, Air Force Nuclear Command, Control, and 
Communications, provides a description of nuclear command, control, and communications 
functions. 
A3.3.  Stockpile Management.  The Air Force maintains an inventory of nuclear weapons to 
fulfill operational requirements.  Weapons reliability depends on sustainment and surveillance 
activities.  Sustainment includes alterations, modifications, life extension programs, limited life 
component exchanges, and other related activities.  Surveillance involves flight and laboratory 
testing of assigned weapons to uncover defects and ensure systems continue to satisfy 
requirements.  Stockpile management requires coordination among Air Force stakeholder 
organizations as well as Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, CCMDs, National 
Nuclear Security Administration, and U.S. nuclear weapon national laboratories.  Planning, 
programming, and budgeting for nuclear weapon stockpile management activities, Air Force 
delivery systems, and other Service-provided equipment are essential to satisfy U.S. national 
security objectives. 
A3.4.  Nuclear Materiel Management.  This activity is associated with responsibilities for 
acquisition, sustainment, research and development, test and evaluation, and installation mission 
support that enable the warfighting capabilities of the Air Force nuclear mission. 
A3.5.  Countering 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
and 
Nuclear-related 
Treaty 
Compliance.  These activities are associated with the Air Force nuclear mission as described in 
AFPD 10-26, Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Enterprise, and AFPD 16-6, 
International Arms Control and Nonproliferation Agreements, and the DoD Foreign Clearance 
Program.

NUCLEAR OCCUPATIONAL COMPETENCIES 
A4.1.  Background.  Deliberate development of military and civilian Airmen supporting the Air 
Force nuclear mission should include nuclear occupational competencies to ensure mission 
success.  Each competency should be coupled with a proficiency level delineated by rank and 
grade to span a nuclear Continuum of Learning (as described in AFI 36-2640, Executing Total 
Force Development).  Reference AFMAN 36-2647, Institutional Competency Development and 
Management, for further information regarding competencies and proficiency levels.  IAW AFI 
36-2640, AF/A10 has established the following six nuclear occupational competencies: 
A4.1.1.  Nuclear Policy and Strategy.  Comprehend the complexities of the changing 
international security environment — to include treaties and agreements — and the role of 
nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy to deter aggression and coercion and to assure Allies 
and partners. 
A4.1.2.  Nuclear Operations and U.S. Nuclear Forces.  Comprehend U.S. nuclear force 
structure, with an emphasis on Air Force forces, to understand the strengths, challenges, and 
support requirements of each element of the force. 
A4.1.3.  U.S. Nuclear Support and Infrastructure.  Recognize acquisition, infrastructure, and 
support requirements for nuclear forces and weapons to sustain the nuclear mission. 
A4.1.4.  Nuclear Surety.  Understand Air Force nuclear weapons surety program to assure 
nuclear weapons system safety, security, and reliability, and to ensure nuclear weapons 
remain under positive control per DoDD 3150.02. 
A4.1.5.  Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications.  Understand NC2 requirements, 
functions, related authorities, and policies, and how NC3 systems support planning and 
execution of the nuclear mission. 
A4.1.6.  Unique Aspects of the Nuclear Mission.  Understand the nuclear operating 
environment produces unique challenges for leadership, personnel, and systems.
