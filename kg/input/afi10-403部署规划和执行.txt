2.13.6.2.1.  “By UTC” refers to deploying complete UTCs based on the TPFDD’s 
required delivery date. 
2.13.6.2.2.  “Within UTC” refers to deploying UTCs by prioritizing the increments 
within the UTC(s). 
2.13.7.  Cargo Movement. 
2.13.7.1.  The Integrated Data Environment Global Transportation Network is the DoD 
system of record for intransit visibility data. 
2.13.7.2.  LRS/Plans and Integration or the DCC will use a LOGMOD file transfer to 
consolidate and pass deploying unit personnel and cargo data from LOGMOD to CMOS 
or GATES IAW AFI 10-401. Note:  If CMOS or GATES are unavailable during 
deployment operations, units should use the following non-automated AF forms:

units use non-automated AF forms to distribute deployment operations related 
transportation information prescribed by the AFI 24-605.  
2.13.7.3.3.  Preparation of pre-planned load plans is highly recommended to expedite 
initial deployment operations.  If used, pre-planned load plans should: 
2.13.7.3.3.1.  Use C-17s as the standard planning aircraft. 
2.13.7.3.3.2.  Use LOGPLAN UTC and increment priorities. 
2.14.  Deployable Containers. 
2.14.1.  463L pallets are the mandatory, standard container for developing standard LOGFOR 
UTCs IAW AFI 10-401.  (T-1).  Exception:  Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources UTCs 
may deviate from this requirement IAW AFI 25-101. 
2.14.2.  Internal Airlift and Helicopter Slingable-Container Units, Cadillac Bins, Brooks & 
Perkins containers, and married pallets used for LOGPLAN UTCs, will not exceed the weight 
of the approved standard UTC IAW AFI 10-401. 
2.14.3.  Air Mobility Command provides 463L pallets to units to meet mission requirements.  
Note:  Units are required to purchase 463L accessories (e.g., nets, tie-downs, connectors, 
dunnage, shoring) and non-standard containers. 
2.14.4.  Units that use organic airlift may purchase and use custom containers will maintain 
463L pallets and nets to deploy their cargo in the event non-organic airlift is used.  (T-1).
