Chapter I 
The Urban Environment 
1. The Nature of the Urban Environment
a. This publication addresses planners’ and tactical operators’ unique
considerations for conducting aviation operations within topographically complex
areas and the adjacent natural terrain, where man-made construction or the density
of population are the dominant features.
b. Analysis of conflicts involving state-actor militaries shows that ill-equipped enemy
forces may successfully use the complex nature of urban combat to overcome
disadvantages in technology, numbers, and firepower. Urban terrain inherently
favors the defense.
Urban Growth 
“Humanity is now a predominantly urban species. Urbanization will likely continue 
to increase into the foreseeable future, with some 60% of the global population 
living in cities, usually near oceans, by 2035.” 
SOURCE: Joint Operating Environment 2035; 
The Joint Force in a Contested and Disordered World 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington D.C., 14 July 2016 
c. Man-made structures and the population density in urban terrain affect tactical
options available to commanders and aircrews. These man-made structures mask
the true number of occupants. Analyzing and understanding daily routines and traffic
patterns of each urban environment enables aviation operations without
unnecessary disruption of societal interconnectedness.
d. The sheer density of the urban environment increases the complexity of planning
and execution. For example, a one-block radius may include mixed-use skyscrapers,
tunnels, utilities, traffic, infrastructure, and an extremely diverse population. Expect
adversaries to use urban terrain for cover and concealment.
2. Components of the Urban Environment
a. The three components of urban environments are terrain (natural and
man-made), society, and supporting infrastructure. The particulars of these
components vary from one urban area to another. Knowledge of these components
is important for planning and executing operations in an urban environment.
b. Urban terrain has four categories: airspace, supersurface, surface, and
subsurface as illustrated in figure 1. All aspects of urban terrain require careful
analysis during planning.

ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
Urban Terrain 
(1) Airspace. Urban-area airspace may be congested due to civilian air traffic
operating under the host nation’s air traffic control system. Planners should
identify all risks associated with operating among civilian air traffic and deconflict
air operations to mitigate risk and to reduce disrupting air traffic. Planners should
develop letters of agreement and emergency security control of air traffic
procedures with host nations to operate within the airspace. With the proliferation
of small unmanned aircraft systems (SUASs), planners and aircrews should be
aware of and account for emerging aviation technology (e.g., commercial
off-the-shelf, swarm technology) employed in the airspace by friendly and enemy
forces and commercial users with no direct involvement in the conflict.
(2) Supersurface. The supersurface is the area above ground level (AGL)
consisting of man-made structures (e.g., buildings, towers, and power lines). The
enemy can use the supersurface for cover, concealment, movement, and fighting
positions. The supersurface provides the enemy excellent fields of view for
antiaircraft defenses and can restrict friendly observation, communication, and
weapons employment. Additional supersurface considerations include:
(a) The supersurface can block radio transmission and video downlink.
Ground personnel, including joint terminal attack controllers (JTACs), must
understand the supersurface can restrict line of sight (LOS) communications.
(b) The supersurface contains urban canyons, which can cause weapons
delivery restrictions (i.e., the podium effect). The depth, length, and width of
urban canyons varies based on the supersurface composition. See chapter 4
for more details.
(c) The height of structures within the supersurface can limit aircraft
maneuvers and air-to-ground approach vectors.

ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29

(3) Surface. The surface is everything at ground level including streets, alleys,
open lots, and parks. Normally, the surface is the maneuver space for ground
forces.
(4) Subsurface. The subsurface is the area below ground level consisting of
sewers, drainage systems, subway tunnels, utility corridors, basements, bunkers,
or other subterranean spaces. This space can be used for cover, concealment,
and movement. Refer to Army Techniques Publication (ATP) 3-21.51,
Subterranean Operations, for more information on the subsurface environment.
The enemy’s knowledge of the subsurface may provide an advantage.
(a) Communication is degraded from aviation assets to the subsurface due to
LOS obstruction, distance below the surface, and construction materials.
(b) Planners should consider using weapons capable of creating penetrating
effects when engaging subsurface targets. However, consider the weapons
effects to critical infrastructure (e.g., building foundations, power lines, gas
lines, and water lines) prior to employment.
(c) Ground forces can identify entrances and exits to subsurface sites, which
allows air assets to observe, disrupt, or destroy the enemy’s use of
subsurface areas.
c. Society. Joint Publication (JP) 3-06, Joint Urban Operations, states “The
commander should keep in mind the overall objectives regarding the civilian
populace: to minimize civilian interference with military operations, minimize mission
impact on the population, and observe the necessary legal, moral, and humanitarian
obligations toward civilians.” Commanders should consider the population of an
urban area as a center of gravity. Commanders should consider the societal and
cultural implications of conducting operations in urban environments. For more
information, see JP 3-06.
d. Supporting Infrastructure. Destroying, controlling, or protecting vital parts of
infrastructure can isolate a threat from potential sources of support. However,
commanders should understand damaging or disrupting any portion of the urban
infrastructure can have unintended consequences, particularly against the
population.
3. Urban Areas
a. Urban areas are composed of more than one municipality; and large
municipalities often have subordinate political units. Planners should identify and
consider the boundaries of these political units. Planners should analyze civil
considerations in terms of areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and
events (ASCOPE), which is outlined in ATP 2-01.3, Intelligence Preparation of the
Battlefield. ASCOPE aligns with an urban area’s overlapping components of terrain,
society, and supporting infrastructure.
b. The most important characteristic of an urban area is its population. While there
is no standard of population size for the various types of municipalities, for the
purposes of this publication, urban areas are defined as seen in table 1.

4. Urban Zones
Most cities contain distinct zones, which are identified by geography. Normally, these 
zones are categorized by the predominate activity within their boundaries. Some typical 
urban zones are shown in figure 2. Planners can help reduce collateral damage (CD) by 
identifying population variances throughout the day (depending on the zone).

Urban Zones 
a. City Core. The city core is the heart of the urban area (the downtown or central
business district). It is relatively small and compact, but contains a large percentage
of the urban area’s shops, offices, and public institutions. Normally, it contains the
highest density of supersurface and subsurface areas. In most cities, the core has
undergone more recent development than the core periphery. As a result, the two
regions are often quite different.
b. Core Periphery. The core periphery is located at the edges of the city core.
Normally, the core periphery consists of streets 12 to 20 meters wide with
continuous fronts of brick or concrete buildings. The building heights are fairly
uniform; 2 or 3 stories in small towns and 5 to 10 stories in large cities.
c. High-rise Residential Areas. High-rise residential areas are typical modern
construction in large cities and towns, consisting of multistory apartments, separated
open areas, and single-story buildings. Their wide streets are normally in rectangular
patterns. These areas are often contiguous to industrial or transportation areas or
interspersed with close, orderly, block areas.
d. Commercial Areas. Commercial areas provide goods and services to the
neighborhoods that surround them and to the city as a whole. Specific activities
include buying and selling goods and services in retail businesses, wholesale
businesses, and financial establishments.

e. Industrial Areas. Industrial areas are generally on or along major rail and highway
routes in urban complexes. It is important to identify the type of industrial activity and
the presence of toxic industrial materials that can affect operations in these areas.
f. Military Areas. Military areas are concentrated areas where the military operates
and may include several types of fortifications or be part of a fortified line.
g. Low-rise Residential Areas. Low-rise residential areas consist of row houses or
single-family dwellings with yards, gardens, trees, and fences. Street patterns are
normally rectangular or nonlinear. Residential zones are typically subdivided by
income or culturally important factors, such as ethnicity or religion.
h. Strip Areas. A strip area is a small urban area built predominately along a
transportation route, such as a road or river (figures 3 and 4). The strip area may
stand alone or link to nearby, larger urban areas. Strip areas often afford covered
avenues of withdrawal to the flanks once an attacking force deploys and before the
security force becomes decisively engaged.

i. Shantytowns. Shantytowns are areas composed of low-income or unemployed
elements of the population living in poorly constructed or older buildings in various
states of decay (figure 5). Most towns and villages in developing countries have
shantytowns, which are often in multiple zones throughout an area.
Shantytown 
(1) Structures within shantytowns are made of readily available materials, such
as cardboard, tin, adobe, or concrete block. These less structurally sound
buildings have no common floor plan and often have only one room. Weapons
fired in or at a structure may penetrate the walls of one or more adjacent
structures and endanger friendly forces as well as noncombatants. There is also
an increased risk of uncontrolled fires due to the flammability of the building
materials.
(2) Armored vehicles may knock down and traverse most shantytown structures
easily, without significantly affecting mobility. However, their destruction may
cause unacceptable civilian casualties. Narrow pathways may also constrict
mobility of vehicles in shantytowns. These unique characteristics increase the
risk of friendly fire incidents and civilian casualties. Commanders should consider

22 FEB 2022 
the effects of their operations in this type of area based on the previous factors 
discussed.  
5. Structures
a. Commanders and leaders should be capable of identifying the basic
characteristics of buildings and be able to understand the effects of weapons against
those buildings within their area of operations (AO). This enables commanders to
give clear instructions concerning mission execution and assists leaders in choosing
the appropriate effects to accomplish their missions.
b. In addition to billeting enemy troops, the city also accommodates the businesses,
government, noncombatants, schools, and similar functions critical to the normal
operations of the city. Minimizing CD reduces the hardships within the city and leads
to a faster return to normalcy. Planners and personnel must abide by the applicable
rules of engagement (ROE), and all other applicable laws, in the targeting process.
Questions about the legality of targeting any structure (whether inhabited or
uninhabited) should be referred to the appropriate legal advisor. Planners and
decision makers should consider proportionality, military necessity, and the effects of
physical infrastructure destruction or reduction on the information environment.
6. Characteristics of Buildings
Planners should consider the following characteristics while executing aviation urban 
operations: function, size, height, materials, exterior openings and floor plans, and 
typical distribution of buildings. 
a. Function. The most important characteristic is the reason for the building, its
function. The four categories of building functions are:
(1) Residential. Residential includes single-family and multifamily housing.
(2) Public and Civic. Public and civic include government buildings, schools and
gyms, airports, bridges, parks and plazas, and stadiums.
(3) Commercial. Commercial includes hotels, restaurants, and retail stores.
(4) Mixed-use. Mixed-use includes a combination of commercial and residential
buildings.
b. Size. The four sizes of buildings are small, medium, large, and massive. These
four sizes have no firm dimensions and are often relative to the building’s function
and the size of other structures in the surrounding urban area. Residential buildings,
particularly single family homes, are categorized separately from other structures.
For this publication, square footage for each of the four building sizes are the
following.
(1) Small buildings are less than 2,000 square feet in size.
(2) Medium buildings are 2,000 square feet to 22,000 square feet (one-half of an
acre).
(3) Large buildings are 22,000 square feet (one-half of an acre) to 44,000 square
feet (1 acre).
(4) Massive buildings are greater than 44,000 square feet (1 acre).

c. Height. The height of a single floor varies slightly by locale, function, and
construction method. However, individual floors, except for the first floor, are
normally the same height throughout a building. For the purposes of this publication,
13 feet (approximately 4 meters) is the average height for a floor. The following are
terms commonly used to refer to building height.
(1) Low-rises. Low-rises are 5 floors (65 feet) or below, often without an elevator.
(2) Mid-rises. Mid-rises are 5 floors (65 feet) to 11 floors (150 feet). Common
international building codes generally require at least one elevator.
(3) High-rises. High-rises are between 12 to 37 floors high (160-490 feet). Most
model international building codes require at least one elevator, as well as stairs,
in all high-rise buildings.
(4) Skyscrapers. Skyscrapers are taller than 500 feet (150 meters) or 37 floors.
International building codes generally require skyscrapers to have at least two
protected elevators and sets of stairwells that span the height of the building.
d. Materials. Knowing a building’s materials and basic method of construction is
important in urban operations. Leaders and planners should understand the basic
effects that weapons cause on structures. Leaders should also understand the
likelihood of fires starting or spreading and the potential effect the fires will have on
thermal-imagery, other night-vision devices (NVDs), and the health of Service
members and the local population. The following are four categories of building
construction materials.
(1) Wood. Wood is normally limited in use do to its flammable characteristics
when other less combustible materials are readily available in the construction of
public, civic, and commercial structures.
(2) Masonry (brick, block, or stone). Masonry offers greater load-bearing
capacity and fire resistance than wood. Brick is favored for residences, while
block is favored for commercial purposes.
(3) Reinforced Concrete. Reinforced concrete is a major structural material in
most buildings. It is used in most foundations and is commonly used as support
columns, exterior walls, interior walls, and roofs. Reinforced concrete is very
strong, resistant to wind and tremors, and provides weatherproofing. Due to its
hardness and reinforcing steel bars, it is difficult to breach.
(4) Steel or Metal. Steel or metal is a major structural material in most framed
buildings. Many public, civic, and commercial structures use steel frames
because of large spans and future required flexibility.
e. Exterior Openings and Floor Plans. Exterior openings and floor plans vary by
building function, size, material, and height. The height and function of a building can
establish distinct common trends. Most buildings limit the number of exterior
openings due to privacy requirements, temperature control, and the higher cost of
constructing these openings. This is especially true for the ground floor of residential
buildings. For most commercial and service-oriented buildings, the ground floor
tends to be open and inviting to attract entry. The following are other common trends
based on the building’s height and function. The following descriptions should be
considered typical but, variations may be encountered.
10 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(1) Residential Buildings.
(a) Low-rise wood and light-metal frame houses have a variety of floor plans.
Interior walls are often semi-permanent and relatively easy to remodel. Direct
fire munitions, shell fragments, and shrapnel easily penetrate both exterior
and interior walls. Breaching an entry point through walls is fairly simple with
an axe or electric saw. The roofs vary greatly from slight, even slopes to
steep, multiple slopes. Like the walls, most roofs are easily breached.
(b) Low-rise masonry houses normally have similar floor plans on each floor.
Exterior and interior walls are permanent and are not easily penetrated by
direct fire munitions, shell fragments, or shrapnel. Breaching an entry point
through a masonry wall requires explosives or an armored vehicle. Roofing
material is often masonry, shale, or other rock-like materials, and the roof
slant varies from flat to a high-angle slant. Breaching deeply slanted roofs or
hard surface roofs is often difficult. Usually, a sledgehammer can breach flat
roofs and a pry bar can breach slanted roofs.
(2) Public, Civic, Commercial, and Mixed-use Buildings. The ground-level floor
plans of these buildings are usually different from the upper-level floor plans. The
ground floor tends to support the primary purpose of the building, and a large
section of the ground floor is often very open, possibly two or three stories high.
Typically, rooms (offices) are adjacent to this large ground floor area. Exterior
walls and interior load-bearing walls typically extend throughout all floors,
reducing in thickness with each height level. These walls can be breached with
explosives. Non load-bearing interior walls are of light construction and easily
breached. Roofs are typically flat and can typically be breached with a sledge
hammer.
(3) Low-rise and Mid-rise Reinforced-concrete Buildings. Reinforced concrete is
relatively inexpensive and easily manufactured. It is used for many public, civic,
commercial, and mixed-use buildings; and for multifamily, low-rise, and mid-rise
apartments and condominiums. However, single-family residences are rarely
made of reinforced concrete.
(4) Residential and Mixed-use Buildings.
(a) Normally, the ground floor of multistory, residential or mixed-use buildings
are different from the upper floors. The floor plans of multistory reinforced
concrete buildings usually are based on a centralized hallway, with stairways
on opposite ends of the building. All four walls, load-bearing interior walls, and
the roof are made of reinforced concrete. However, the ground floors of
multistory buildings tend to include additional exterior openings and internal
space.
(b) For a residential building or the residential upper floors of a mixed-use
building, the floor plans of each residential floor (other than the ground floor)
are usually similar. The only common exception to this is the penthouse floor,
which tends to have larger sized residences. Additionally, the roofs of these
buildings often have roof access doors. Normally, the best way to enter this
type of building is through a door or a ground floor opening.
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
11 
(5) Public-gathering Buildings. Public gathering buildings (such as theaters,
auditoriums, and gyms) have large, open interiors. Normally, interior walls are
often not reinforced concrete and are easy to breach or dismantle. The roofs, for
aesthetic purposes, are often geometric and not easily accessible. Public
gathering buildings are most common in dispersed residential and high-rise
residential areas.
(6) Low-rise and Mid-rise, Steel-frame Buildings. Normally, steel frame buildings
are recognized by the concrete beams and columns surrounding the steel and
visible from the outside. The floor plans vary depending on the building’s function.
Additionally, the use of light or heavy cladding varies in terms of aesthetics and
function. Light cladding includes glass and light metal coverings. Heavy cladding
includes reinforced concrete and thick composite materials. The floors of these
buildings are heavy and provide moderate overhead cover.
(7) Office and Residential Buildings. Normally, these buildings have three or four
small offices or rooms connected to form an office group or residence. The
offices have dimensions based on the distance between the steel columns and
are connected to an interior hall, which is connected to stairs; and often, an
elevator. Core rooms in framed buildings are much bigger than in other buildings.
Light-weight materials used as partitions often subdivide the core rooms.
(8) Factories. Factories have large windows and open interiors, which favor the
use of most weapons. Since the structures are often made to support heavy
machinery, these reinforced surfaces provide good overhead cover.
(9) Commercial Buildings. Large commercial stores have large, open interiors.
Steel fire doors, which are heat activated, often exist between sections of the
buildings. Once closed, they are difficult to breach or force open, but they
effectively divide the store into sections.
(10) Public and Civic Buildings. Public and civic buildings are rarely made to the
height of a high-rise or skyscraper. However, public and civic services may be
integrated into the lower floors of a high-rise or skyscraper.
(11) High-rise, Reinforced-concrete and Steel-frame Buildings and Skyscrapers.
All high-rise buildings use a skeleton frame, and most have a central core
containing two stairwells, elevators, and all other environmental support items. In
some cases, lower floors of high-rise buildings use heavy cladding, while upper
floors use light cladding.
f. Typical Distribution of Buildings. Certain types of buildings dominate certain parts
of a city, which establishes patterns within a city. Analysis of the distribution and
nature of these patterns directly affects planning and selecting weapons (figure 6).
12 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
Distribution of Building Types 
(1) Urban zones and building types are interrelated. Residential areas
predominately have low-rise framed or masonry buildings, while commercial and
industrial zones have masonry and reinforced-concrete buildings. Availability of
material and local culture determines which materials predominate. The central
core usually contains the majority of high-rise, steel- and concrete-frame
buildings. These multistory buildings occupy core areas (a city’s most valuable
land), usually the center of the city’s economic and political power.
(2) Open space accounts for about 15 percent of an average city’s area. Many
open spaces are grass-covered parks, athletic fields, and preserves. Some are
broad, paved areas. The largest open spaces are associated with suburban
residential areas, where large tracts of land often act as recreation areas.
(3) Streets serving areas that consist of primarily one building type, normally,
have a common street pattern. For example, high land values in downtown areas
often result in narrow angular streets. Street widths are grouped into three major
classes:
(a) Seven to 15 meters, located in older historical sections of
pre-industrialized cities.
(b) Fifteen to 25 meters, located in newer, planned sections of most cities.
(c) Twenty-five to 50 meters, located along broad boulevards or set far apart
on large parcels of land.
(4) Streets consist of varying types of materials (asphalt, cement, gravel, and
stone) which have different load bearing capabilities and take varying amounts of
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
13 
force to render impassable. It is also important to consider the 2nd and 3rd order 
effects of targeting road surfaces. Once destroyed they will be rendered 
impassable to everyone (friendly forces, enemy forces, and the civilian 
population). 
g. Street Patterns.
(1) Street patterns within an urban environment can be attributed to deliberate
design, natural features, man-made structures, and the changing needs of the
inhabitants. Urban areas can have any or all of the seven patterns shown in
figure 7.
(2) Street patterns influence all warfighting functions. For example, knowledge of
street patterns and widths gives commanders and leaders a good idea of whether
or not mounted mobility corridors permit movement and maneuver of wheeled or
tracked vehicles, and facilitates command and control (C2) and sustainment
operations.

7. Aviation Operations in the Urban Environment
Aviation units are involved in a variety of operations in an urbanized environment (e.g., 
decisive action or stability operations). Employment of aviation assets enhances urban 
operations, but presents unique tactical challenges. 
a. Aviation enhances urban operations by providing:
(1) Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).
(2) Security.
(3) Responsive and flexible resupply.
(4) Rapid troop movement.
(5) Rescue and evacuation of personnel and equipment.
(6) Precision fires in support of ground forces.
(7) The ability to quickly transition to new missions.
b. Tactical challenges of aviation urban operations are as follows:
(1) Physical Limitations.
(a) Enemy Advantages. The availability of obstacles, cover, concealment,
and familiarity of environment (e.g., subsurface, surface, and supersurface) to
complement defense and maneuver.
(b) Layouts. City layouts complicate traditional methods of military operations
due to limited maneuvering space within the surface, supersurface, and
airspace.
(c) LOS Issues. Operating within vertical construction or subterranean
infrastructure limits LOS communications.
(d) Night Operations. Cultural lighting can degrade aircrews’ NVDs, reducing
their effectiveness and obscuring low-flying aircraft.
(2) Logistics and Medical Support.
(a) Urban operations require a flexible logistical support systems due to
potential unit dispersion in nonconsolidated urban areas. Units may be
required to inhabit multiple bases of operation as opposed to consolidated
staging areas.
(b) A responsive and robust treatment and evacuation plan for casualties is
critical.
(c) To meet casualty and evacuation requirements, plan to establish aid
stations, ambulance exchange points, and landing zones (LZs) as far forward
as the situation allows.
(3) Urban Population. The most difficult tactical challenge is the operators’ ability
to distinguish between combatants and noncombatants.
22 FEB 2022

15 
c. Commanders conducting operations on or against objectives located within or
adjacent to complex urban topology should emphasize the following:
(1) Unified planning from concept through execution.
(2) A single, common set of standards (e.g., graphics, terms, and times) usable
by all ground, naval, and aviation forces.
(3) C2 considerations requiring early integration and synchronization of:
(a) Spectrum management.
(b) Airspace management, with emphasis on SUAS employment and
identification.
(c) Precision fires in the vicinity of civilian populations and noncombatants.

Chapter II 
GENERAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 
1. Introduction
a. A clear understanding of the commander’s intent and ROE is imperative for
mission planning and operations. Normally, the ground force commander is the
supported commander for urban operations.
b. Operations in urban terrain follow traditional planning and execution concepts
with additional, unique planning considerations, which include:
(1) Aircraft deconfliction in confined airspace.
(2) Operations in urban canyons.
(3) Urban terrain to include surface, supersurface, and subsurface development.
(4) The presence of towers, wires, and antenna hazards.
(5) The complications with target correlation in the supersurface and subsurface.
(6) Difficulty in threat detection and identification.
(7) A high concentration of noncombatants.
(8) Political, social, cultural, operational, and strategic considerations, which
influence ROE.
(9) An increased potential for CD.
c. Urban operations require planners to have a thorough knowledge and
understanding of key terrain (i.e., intersections, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools,
and cultural, religious, and municipal buildings), flight routes, and flight hazards (i.e.,
towers, wires, and power lines). Space support personnel can produce a number of
products to assist in the mitigation of unknown obstacles, such as recent
unclassified satellite imagery that is releasable to coalition partners or the
geographical view from a specific point and a virtual flythrough. These products can
assist aircrews by minimizing the number of unknowns and for visualizing an
objective area.
d. Due to high concentrations of civilians and potential concealment advantages,
urban operations require a significant planning effort devoted to suppression of
enemy air defenses (SEAD). However, planners must be aware that effective SEAD
effects may be unattainable in urban environments. While this publication will not
address the specifics of SEAD, planners must consider CD concerns for SEAD
operations in an urban environment.
2. Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (JIPOE)
Planners face unique challenges when conducting JIPOE in an urban environment. 
Environmental variables and vertical development may preclude the effectiveness of 
overhead imagery systems (i.e., intelligence collection operations). Planning 
considerations for JIPOE in support of urban operations include the following. 
22 FEB 2022

ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
a. Urban Terrain. Urban terrain presents the enemy unique cover and concealment
requiring the detailed integration of multiple intelligence sources such as signals
intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence, and geospatial intelligence.
b. Hazards. Detailed analysis of flight hazards during mission planning is critical to
safe flight operations and mission accomplishment. Flight hazards include:
(1) Physical Hazards. The majority of physical hazards within an urban area are
man-made and include kites, antennas, wires, power lines, and other
obstructions (e.g., trash and debris). Cluttered environments (e.g., lights, fires,
smoke, and marking lasers) may make identification of enemy surface-to-air fires
difficult.
(2) Environmental Hazards. These include impacts caused by meteorological
effects conditions (e.g., haze, mist, dust, smog, precipitation, natural illumination,
cloud cover, and winds), artificial illumination, turbulence caused by uneven
convective heating, and unpredictable wind effects.
(3) Natural Hazards. These include mountains, hills, trees, and areas with high
concentrations of birds.
(4) Air Traffic Hazards. A high volume of air traffic within urban areas include
rotary-wing, tiltrotor, and fixed-wing aircraft, commercial and military SUAS, and
civilian traffic. Missions employing SUASs, rotary-wing, or tiltrotor aircraft must
consider vertical fields of fire for artillery, armor, and heavy machine guns.
Furthermore, SUAS operations by friendly ground forces presents air hazards
and must be integrated into airspace control planning.
(5) Electromagnetic Hazards. High-intensity radio transmission areas (HIRTAs)
may adversely affect aircraft communication, navigation, and electrical systems.
Planners should review the location and effects of known and suspected HIRTA
sites. Electromagnetic hazards can include the enemy’s use of Global Positioning
System (GPS) jammers and spectrum interference from friendly jammers. Space
operators can provide navigational accuracy predictions and plotting of known
jammer effects to assist with planning considerations.
c. Enemy.
(1) JIPOE should account for surface and supersurface threats to ground forces.
Such threats include the presence of snipers, improvised explosive devices
(IEDs), explosive hazards, booby traps, subterranean fires assets, and
high-energy laser pointers.
(2) Urban operations provide opposing forces with unique options for
surface-to-air attacks against friendly aircraft and a complex threat for friendly
forces. The predominant threats to aviation assets in an urban environment
include:
(a) Small arms and machine guns. Weapons emplacement include
supersurface (e.g., the upper floors of buildings and roof tops), ramps, and
approach paths to airfields.
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
19 
(b) Antiarmor rockets, such as rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and
antitank guided missiles. These are readily available, inexpensive, and
normally standard equipment at small-unit levels.
(c) Light-to-medium air defense artillery (ADA). Adversaries can employ
light-to-medium ADA from ground sites, tops of buildings, in or near otherwise
protected structures (e.g., areas selected due to friendly force ROE
constraints), or mounted on civilian vehicles.
(d) Man-portable air defense systems (MANPADSs). MANPADs are small,
allow for rapid engagements, and are easy to conceal.
(e) Tank guns and antitank guided missiles. These contain modern fire
control systems that permit effective engagements against hovering or
slow-flying helicopters.
(f) Commercial off-the-shelf SUAS. These SUAS can be weaponized or
modified to carry military-grade munitions, can be employed alone or as
swarms against ground forces and rotary-wing or tiltrotor aircraft while
hovering, during takeoff and landing, or while refueling or rearming on the
surface.
(g) Heavy ADA and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Normally, heavy ADA
and SAMs require extended beyond LOS detection capabilities due to radar
or system aiming requirements. Adversaries can employ them within urban
boundaries.
(3) Every structure in an urban area is a potential enemy position. For example,
enemy forces can establish a command post in a basement to take advantage of
concealment and survivability.
(a) Surface obstructions and airspace coordinating measures over urban
areas limit low-altitude aircraft maneuvering options while providing the
enemy excellent opportunities for establishing ambush sites.
(b) Joint fires observers, JTACs, forward air controller (airborne) (FAC(A))
and aircrews should anticipate danger-close scenarios when planning urban
operations. For more information, refer to JP 3-09.3, Close Air Support.
d. Friendly.
(1) Pilots of low-flying aircraft need to be aware of fields of fire from air and
ground forces. Low-flying aircraft can inadvertently fly through fields of fire from
dismounted troops (e.g., troops firing at roofs of buildings).
(2) Aircraft firing at enemy positions must ensure friendly forces are clear of
weapons effects at the intended target.
(3) Two-way communication and accurate graphic control measures tied to
identifiable terrain features increases the ability to synchronize aviation effects in
support of ground force.
(4) A planner should consider the following civilian population issues:
20 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(a) Population density.
(b) The ability to distinguish combatants from noncombatants.
(c) Neighborhoods and their characteristics.
(d) Patterns of life (e.g., religious practices, normal movements, and unique
cultural characteristics).
(e) Cultural and historical significance of structures and areas.
3. Command, Control, and Communications Considerations
a. C2 Planning.
(1) A detailed, flexible, and redundant C2 plan alleviates the electromagnetic
challenges associated with urban environments and enables uninterrupted
communication.
(2) Vertical structures can limit or negate LOS radio communications.
(3) Natural disasters can degrade or damage preexisting C2 networks.
(4) Airborne C2 and radio relay support systems, rooftop retransmission
systems, radios using high-power transmissions, and remote antennas may
overcome some of the transmission problems.
b. Combined Arms Rehearsal. Joint operations in urban environments benefit from
detailed combined arms rehearsals to synchronize effects. Combined arms
rehearsals should include all aerial assets assigned or attached for the duration of
the operation.
c. Pre-mission Briefing. Prior to each mission, planners brief and update the
aircrews with the most current intelligence assessments to include friendly force
updates.
d. Air Asset Deconfliction and Integration.
(1) Airspace control elements (e.g., Airborne Warning and Control System
(AWACS), tactical air operations centers (TAOCs), and control and reporting
centers (CRCs)) use both positive and procedural control methods to deconflict
and integrate air assets above the coordinating altitude. Beneath the coordinating
altitude, other airspace control elements (e.g., joint air-ground integration center),
direct air support center, airspace information center, and JTACs) use procedural
control methods to deconflict and integrate air assets.
(2) Other than Army attack aviation procedure missions, the JTAC, FAC(A), or
air officer are the primary controllers for aircraft operating within their assigned
AO.
(3) Due to the high density of air traffic (military and civilian) in the urban
environment it is important to properly plan for airspace control through effective
use of coordination measures, air defense measures and fire support
coordination measures.
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
21 
(4) Following natural disasters, both civilian and government aircraft can be
present and not in communication with military airspace control elements.
(5) Aircrews should establish communications with ground maneuver elements
as soon as possible while en route to the objective. Additionally, aircrews should
establish communications with controlling agencies before crossing airspace
boundaries.
e. Frequency Management.
(1) Saturation of the electromagnetic spectrum within the urban environment
makes it essential to have a detailed frequency management plan for all voice
and data spectrum users.
(2) Urban areas can reduce radio frequency availability for airborne platforms
due to preexisting public safety and commercial aviation usage.
(3) Subordinate commands should deconflict all radio frequency assignments
and requirements with the regional or area frequency manager.
4. Contested and Congested Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Spectrum
Considerations
Commanders and staffs face the challenge of enabling joint, interorganizational, and 
multinational collaboration while assuring access to critical data and information 
networks in increasingly congested and contested cyberspace domain and 
electromagnetic environment while simultaneously denying the same to the enemy. 
Operating in congested and contested information environment requires commanders 
and their staffs to synchronize signal, cyberspace, and electromagnetic warfare 
capabilities through cyberspace electromagnetic activities. Cyberspace and 
electromagnetic activities must be planned, integrated, and synchronized with 
cyberspace and electromagnetic warfare operations in support of unified land 
operations. 
5. Congested Airspace
a. A dense, three-dimensional, urban environment creates challenges in planning
and executing airspace control. Planners should synchronize aviation assets and
ground fires into the ground scheme of maneuver. Planning and execution become
difficult given the enemy’s proximity to friendly forces, protected sites, and
noncombatants. For example, a ground unit may request an air medical evacuation
(MEDEVAC) and close air support (CAS) simultaneously, resulting in multiple
aircraft operating within the same airspace.
b. Planners should determine the necessary minimum airspace required for a
mission. Allocating minimum airspace allows more missions to fly in dense airspace
but can hinder tactical execution and threat reaction options. Airspace control
planning considerations must include:
(1) Host nation civil operations, foreign military airspace requirements, other
governmental agencies, and civilian agencies.
(2) Boundaries for participating and nonparticipating aircraft operating in the AO.
22 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(3) Airspace control plan, air tasking order, and airspace control order for
deconfliction and synchronization of aviation assets, which may include
multinational air assets.
(4) Positive control procedures. Refrain from using see and avoid or sense and
avoid as a primary deconfliction measure. Visual detection is difficult in the urban
environment.
(5) Communication procedures for aircraft to alert friendly ground forces of
impending dangers (e.g., low passes, full-motion video (FMV) flight paths, and
infrared (IR) pointer usage).
c. Holding and Assembly Area Techniques.
(1) Avoid loitering over urban terrain at low altitudes due to threats and physical
hazards.
(2) Plan for in-flight contingencies to use rally points or holding areas.
(3) Select assembly or holding areas using the same considerations required
when selecting helicopter LZs forward arming and refueling points (FARPs), and
air-delivered ground refueling (ADGR) sites.
(4) Consider concealment, presence of friendly ground forces for security, and
protected facilities for personnel and equipment.
d. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Considerations.
(1) SUAS.
(a) SUAS are recognized as group 1 and 2 unmanned aircraft (UA) and its
supporting ground control elements. These can be operated autonomously or
remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or
nonlethal payload. Some Services include group 3 as SUAS. See table 2 for
more information about UAS categories.
(b) Many SUAS are not capable of positive control. Many of the coordination
measures and basic deconfliction methods (e.g., time, lateral, altitude, or
combination thereof) used to procedurally control manned aircraft can be
used to control SUAS. Planners must take into account most SUAS ground
control stations do not allow the operator to program a large number of
navigation waypoints, some allowing four or less. Simple routing of SUAS
transiting the battlespace (e.g., paralleling roads, train tracks, power lines,
lower transit altitudes, etc.) may help manned aircrew avoid SUAS collisions
avoid airspace congestion.
(c) It is generally the low, slow, and smaller UASs (Groups 1, 2, and some 3)
that pose a challenge to detect, track, identify, and engage. New capabilities
are being developed to counter these systems and must be considered and
integrated into the overall air defense plan.
(2) Remotely-piloted Aircraft (RPA). The Air Force refers to its groups 4 and 5
UASs as RPAs to differentiate its operators who have been trained to similar
standards as manned aircraft pilots.

(3) Route Planning. Planners must consider UAS lost-link contingency
procedures. The pilot or operator should announce a lost-link condition over
tactical chat and the common air battle net as soon as the tactical situation
allows. This announcement should include the immediate contingency actions the
UAS will take in its lost-link condition. Consider using airspace control elements
(e.g., AWACS, TAOC, and CRC) to relay a lost-link situation.
6. Operational Planning Products
a. General Considerations. Consider all types of geospatial products, ranging from
paper tourist maps to digital mapping databases (commercial and government).
(1) Maps with a large scale provide greater detail for urban mission planning and
execution than small-scale maps.
(2) Due to the dynamics of urban growth, current maps and photographs are not
always available. In the absence of these materials, detailed reconnaissance is
required to minimize risk.
WARNING 
Check the reference system used to prepare a map or chart (i.e., 
World Geodetic System 1984, the current joint standard, and 
Tokyo Special). Different datum can cause significant confusion, 
position errors, and lead to friendly fire incidents. 
24 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
Note: Planners should ensure operational planning products are discernible from 
ground and air perspectives. Once developed, the publishing headquarters should 
disseminate the products to all units, including their higher headquarters. 
b. Geospatial Products.
(1) Units should maintain accurate and current geospatial products for their
operational area and continuously update them as new features are identified.
This is a shared responsibility for aircrews, intelligence personnel, and operations
staff sections. For example, the intelligence staff may have the only source of
hazard information, but they require aircrews’ input to produce relevant aviation
maps and charts before mission execution.
(2) Other hazard sources include the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
and the airspace control element which publishes known flight hazards, such as
notices to airmen.
c. Common Operations Graphics.
(1) Due to the constantly changing nature of the urban environment, it is
especially important for participating units to have common operational graphics
pertaining to the mission. Version control of paper and electronic mission
products (i.e., maps, graphics, gridded reference graphic (GRG), etc.) is critical to
planning and execution. Joint force, theater, or organizational standard operating
procedures are typical documents where common terms and graphics are
defined for the area of interest.
(2) Depicting objectives and phase lines on common graphics illustrates the
ground force commander’s scheme of maneuver and established control
measures.
7. Urban Grids and Reference Techniques
a. It is essential for all forces to use the same reference system and GRG. Ground
maneuver elements use a terrain-based reference system during urban operations
because they allow for quick correlation between air and ground assets.
b. Planners can overlay a grid reference system to most urban areas to produce the
GRG. One technique uses the military grid reference system (MGRS) while the
second uses a simple grid system. Both techniques use a number to identify each
building, and code the corners of buildings to expedite fires. Target handover to the
aircrew is simply the location from the grid system and a brief target description.
c. The MGRS coordinate system allows joint planners to efficiently produce the
required GRG for an entire AO. It provides easy plotting, that is, distance and
reference determination for air and ground elements. For example Grid 96, 33 in
figure 8 references the position marked by the X.

25 
MGRS GRG 
d. The simple grid system technique is useful when the objective area is not aligned
with a north-up orientation or the objective area is small and requires additional
detail. The scale of the grid should relate to distances common to urban
engagements while making it usable as a quick reference. Label each grid and
building in a consistent, sequential manner. For example, B3 in figure 9 references
the position marked by the X.

Urban Sector GRG 
e. The GRG is the supported ground force commander’s product. The commander
is responsible for disseminating it to supporting units, appropriate joint agencies, and
subordinate commands. Graphics should include version numbers, a point of
contact, phone numbers, and email addresses so the issuing organization can
ensure it controls the versions and operators use the latest update. Graphics should
also include date and time that the product was published to ensure that planners
and operators are using proper documents.
f. As time and mission objectives allow, add basic named areas of interest (such as
cloverleaves, bridges, and other choke points) to the graphics template.
g. Upon arrival in the objective area, aircrews should transition to the reference
system in use by the ground element.
h. Figure 10 is an example of reference areas. Reference areas are created by
intersections of roads or by other dominant geographical features. For nonlinear
road structures in some cities, this type of system may be useful.

Urban Operations Sketch 
i. Planners and operators use objective area and target reference point (TRP)
techniques to identify targets when given a fixed point, distance, and direction.
Preplanned TRPs have multiple uses to coordinate fires, but not all TRPs are
suitable for use as a target reference system when coordinating CAS. The supported
unit and the supporting aircrew must recognize the TRP, or known point, which is
either preplanned or agreed to on site. Figure 11 identifies five TRPs from the
commander’s fire support plan. TRP 004 is unsuitable for the target reference
technique because it is not easily identifiable from the air, but the water tower
identified as TRP 002 is suitable. Also, figure 11 provides an example of a CAS
9-line excerpt using the objective area reference-grid technique.

Target Reference Point Technique 
j. Building marking techniques give the aircrew a specific location in reference to a
building or fixed structure. In figure 12, all building sides are numbered clockwise
starting with the front. In figure 13, the floors, windows, and openings of the structure
are labeled numerically (floors) and alphabetically (windows, openings). Number the
floors starting with the ground floor and ascending to the top floor. Windows and
openings are assigned letters, beginning with A, and are labeled from left to right.
The lettering sequence starts over with each floor, ensuring all windows, openings,
and obvious holes or breaches are assigned the appropriate letter. This technique
may also incorporate a direct description (i.e., the window to the right of the flames).
Note: Any numbering or labeling method can be used as long as agreed upon and 
easily understood by all participants (e.g., colors, phase lines, and cardinal directions).

8. Urban Flight Techniques
a. Commanders should evaluate the tactical situation and weigh the requirements
for tactical surprise. While low flight profiles increase surprise, they can increase the
risk of controlled flight into terrain or obstacles. Conversely, while high profiles may
enhance early enemy detection, they may lower the risk of enemy fire with small
arms.
30 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
b. Factors to consider when determining flight profiles include:
(1) Tactical mission.
(2) Risk assessment and mitigation.
(3) Terrain relief and building height in and around the flight path.
(4) Density of structures.
(5) Accessibility and security of high rooftops.
(6) Dominant natural terrain around the urban area.
(7) Integrated air defense system.
(8) Small arms, MANPADS, SAMs, RPGs, and laser pointers, which are easily
concealed and operated from multiple urban vantage points.
(9) Aircraft survivability equipment.
(10) Aircraft defense or survivability tactics, techniques, and procedures.
(11) Audible signature.
(12) Terrestrial lighting.
9. Urban Navigation
a. Challenges in Urban Terrain.
(1) A high concentration of structures.
(2) A variety of geographical references.
(3) Increased cultural lighting.
(4) LOS interference.
(5) Changing landscapes due to combat operations.
(6) GPS and spectrum jamming.
b. Mitigation Methods.
(1) Familiarity with the characteristics of urban terrain and clearly identifiable
landmarks for navigation.
(2) The use of GPS reduces problems associated with night navigation and
orientation. IR pointers, markers, or laser target designators may reduce the
problems associated with orientation and target identification.
(3) Effective navigation over large towns and cities requires using a variety of
navigational systems and techniques discussed in the following paragraphs.
c. Navigation Techniques. Man-made features may provide the majority of available
navigation aids. If possible, pick unique and large recognizable features for
navigation, such as cemeteries, stadiums, cathedrals, and highways.
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
31 
(1) Linear features, such as major highways, rivers, railways, canals, and
coastlines, provide easily recognizable boundaries and references to assist
aircrews in maintaining orientation.
(2) Prominent rail and highway interchanges are useful as en route checkpoints.
However, these areas are high risk for enemy activity.
10. Drop Zone (DZ) Techniques
a. DZ operations in urban terrain require extensive planning due to limited
availability of suitable sites. Surface obstructions, availability of alternate DZs, and
positive identification (PID) of the primary DZ make airdrop operations difficult in the
urban environment.
b. Parks, roads, railroad yards, airfields, athletic stadiums, and industrial storage
sites are examples of possible locations for airdrops.
c. Positive control of personnel near the DZ or concealing the DZ until immediately
before use, reduces the possibility of injuring civilians.
11. LZ Considerations
a. Studying city composition, imagery, and maps provides a good foundation for
choosing LZs. However, selecting a LZ from only a map of the urban environment is
not recommended because of the rapidly changing environment. Special
considerations in an urban environment include enemy disposition, suitability,
environment, and obstacles.
b. Review current imagery to accurately assess LZ size and hazards. Ground
photos can provide valuable information and terrain references. Examine products
from reconnaissance assets and make these available to all participants. Annotate
all images and diagrams with magnetic north and navigation references. Reference
a LZ planning guide. See table 3 for LZ size requirements.

Notes: Service or unit standard operating procedures or aircrew proficiency may require

c. LZ Selection.
(1) Primary LZ. LZs should be easily identifiable and accessible from the air and
ground. Most major cities have urban parks that may provide a suitable LZ. Other
potential LZs include athletic stadiums, golf courses, and parking lots. Due to the
limited number of suitable areas, planners should assume the enemy knows and
will observe the majority of suitable LZs.
(2) Alternate LZ. Planners should use the same considerations and levels of
detail when selecting alternate and emergency LZs.
(3) Load-bearing Structures. Some structures can accommodate helicopters
landing on their rooftop, but planners cannot accurately determine the load
bearing capacity through observation unless they are marked (i.e., existing
rooftop helipads).
(4) Rooftop LZ Hazards. Roof clutter (e.g., antennas, satellite dishes, lightning
rods, wires, furniture, and trash) can obstruct the landing area. Cultural
considerations (e.g., building occupants sleeping on residential roof tops during
summer months) should also be taken into account. Aircrews should expect
unpredictable winds, turbulence, or vortices while flying in the urban environment.
Mechanical turbulence will often be encountered near large heating, ventilating,
and air conditioning and exhaust systems usually located on commercial and
industrial building roof tops. Additionally, rooftop perimeter walls will amplify
aircraft rotor downwash during landing. This will often create a pronounced
suction effect, causing a rapid descent during the last few feet prior to landing. If
not properly accounted for, the aircraft will land abruptly. Due to these conditions,
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
33 
hover out-of-ground-effect power may be needed to conduct a safe roof-top 
landing, even when the crew is planning to conduct a maneuver which may only 
require in-ground-effect performance associated with flight in proximity of tall 
buildings. 
(5) LZs should be placed as close as tactically feasible to the periphery of the
urban area edge. Additionally, approach and departure directions should be
planned in advance to minimize exposure to enemy fire.
(6) Urban environments create significant challenges for LOS communications
and aircraft might need to establish communications at increased altitudes and
sacrifice communications during final approach to the LZ. This can be mitigated
using multi-ship operations or by using other airborne assets to relay
communications.
(7) Tactical Considerations.
(a) If there are more aircraft than a single LZ can accommodate, select
multiple LZs in proximity to the objective.
(b) Control measures are essential to deconflict movement of all elements.
• Give special consideration to deconflict egress routes from
geographically separated LZs supporting the same objective area.
• Light pollution associated with large cities can mask aircraft from one
another in low illumination environments once aircraft are in the LZ.
(c) Balance the availability of suitable LZs and exposure to observation,
direct fire, or ambush. Execution considerations include:
• Day operations allow for rapid ingress and egress, but facilitates
observation and engagement by the enemy.
• Night missions offer improved concealment and LZ security, but may
require slower airspeeds and an increased pilot workload.
12. Rooftop Insertion and Extraction
a. Due to varying load bearing capabilities of urban structures, aircrews may use a
variety of rooftop insertion and extraction techniques. Additionally, the presence of
hazards (e.g., antennas, wires, and fences) present challenges to safe operations.
These techniques include:
(1) Remaining light on the landing gear after touchdown. This prevents structural
damage or roof-top cave in under the loads of the landing aircraft. Unless landing
on a rated helipad in which the load bearing capability is known, this technique
should be used and emphasized for all rooftop landings.
(2) Hovering with a single skid or landing gear touching the structure.
(3) Performing a low hover.
(4) Fast rope and rappelling.
(5) Using rope ladders.
34 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(6) Performing hoist operations (preferred for evacuation of civilians).
b. If more than one insertion and extraction element is required, consider using
multiple insertion flight profiles to remain unpredictable and to avoid congestion at
the objective area.
13. FARP Operations and ADGR
a. Assessment of potential FARP and ADGR locations are similar to the basic
considerations for selection of LZs or pickup zones. Planners must consider the
following when planning FARP and ADGR operations.
(1) The size to accommodate the refueling and rearming element and the
number and type of aircraft using the FARP and ADGR.
(2) The number of FARPs and ADGRs required.
(3) Security requirements of FARPs and ADGRs to mitigate the risk from
combatants during refuel and rearm operations.
(4) Ground entry and exit routes.
(5) Predominant winds and obstacles.
(6) Sufficient maneuver space to reposition, hover, and climb out for aircraft with
limited power and heavy loads.
(7) Ingress and egress routes to FARP are clear of wires, towers, and antennas
to facilitate a shallow landing into a confined area.
(8) Marshalling plans during normal and low-light visibility conditions for
rotary-wing, tiltrotor, and fixed-wing aircraft.
b. FARP and ADGR locations should provide concealment from the surrounding
terrain and buildings to facilitate securing potential ground entry and exit routes.
Consider the use of sports stadiums or established airfields.
c. Consider normal and low-light visibility conditions at proposed FARP and ADGR
sites before designing marshalling plans, especially when rotary-wing, tiltrotor, and
fixed-wing assets are involved in the FARP and ADGR operation.
14. Environmental and Night Considerations
a. Environmental Concerns. Environmental concerns can include weather, lighting
conditions, IR signatures, visibility, thermal reflection, and smoke or fog. For a
detailed discussion of these conditions, refer to JP 3-09.3.
b. Weather. Weather conditions affect individual weapons systems differently.
Inertial navigation and GPS-aided guidance systems are not affected by weather
conditions. While GPS is not affected by terrestrial weather, its accuracy can be
affected during times of increased and excessive solar and geomagnetic storm
activity. See JP 3-09.3 for weather effects on CAS.
(1) Ceilings.
(a) Low ceilings can obscure high-rise rooftops and other physical hazards
and obstructions (e.g., power lines, towers, or smokestacks).
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
35 
(b) Low ceilings can deny aircraft the required time and altitude to obtain
satisfactory ordnance delivery and avoid fragmentation.
(c) Artificial lighting with a low, overcast cloud condition may highlight aircraft
to ground observers and adversely affect NVD performance.
(2) Visibility. Reduced visibility (due to smog, smoke, rain, fog, or dust) can
degrade the performance of aircraft sensors and weapon system effectiveness.
(3) Winds. In urban areas, city structures affect wind patterns. High winds in an
urban area may adversely affect the accuracy of low-altitude, unguided weapons
because wind patterns are disrupted and funneled down streets and alleys.
c. IR and NVD Use.
(1) IR signatures are affected by the proximity of buildings and structures. Urban
temperatures are generally higher than rural areas and can be 10 to 20 degrees
higher than the surrounding environment. Thermal heating can adversely affect
thermal sights and other IR sensors. In many cases, unaided vision is sufficient
for some portions of target acquisition and engagement.
(2) Urban lights may overwhelm aircrew NVDs and render them useless for
standard night formation tactics. Plans may need adaptation to allow for
additional deconfliction. The presence of urban lighting may preclude the use of
IR strobe lights as effective marking tools, as it can be difficult for aircrew to
discern one particular light sources from a multitude of others.

Chapter III 
URBAN AVIATION MISSIONS 
1. Introduction
Aircraft perform the same missions in urban environments as in other, more permissive 
areas. The primary difference is the aircraft’s effectiveness in the urban environment. It 
is important for ground force commanders, planners, and aircrews to understand the 
capabilities and limitations of various aircraft to optimize performance and effectiveness. 
2. ISR
ISR synchronizes and integrates the planning and operation of sensors, assets, and 
processing, exploiting, and dissemination systems in direct support of current and future 
operations. 
a. Specific Urban Considerations.
(1) Urban environments contain significant clutter, which increases the time
required to process information and produce intelligence. Real-time situational
awareness (SA) gained from aircrew callouts, in response to onboard sensors or
FMV, can aid the ground force commander in dynamic decision making.
(2) ISR altitude selection criteria for urban environments.
(a) Low altitudes may result in a greater chance of visual and audible
detection. However, increased ambient ground noise may allow aircraft
tasked with ISR to fly at lower altitudes without audible detection.
(b) Sensor fidelity increases as slant range decreases.
(c) Field of view decreases as slant range decreases.
(d) Low altitudes increase the effects of urban canyons and grazing angle.
(e) High altitudes reduce the clarity of three-dimensional characteristics.
b. Specific Employment Techniques.
(1) Tactical ISR provides the supported commander increased SA. Tactical ISR
can provide direct communication between the aircrew and the ground force
commander, which allows the commander to quickly adjust collection priorities.
(2) When utilized, the ISR tactical controller synthesizes planning, execution, and
initial assessments for near real-time, tactical integration of airborne collection
assets into the supported commander’s scheme of maneuver.
(3) Tactical ISR has a direct link to an intelligence analyst who conducts
real-time analysis for the ground commander or airborne sensor operator trained
to exploit raw data. This quick analysis helps mitigate risk from threats and
reduce friendly fire and CD concerns. It also enables the find, fix, track, target,
engage, and assess kill chain.
(4) As early as possible, ISR aircrews should contact the supported unit to
gather last-minute changes to the mission.
38 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(5) Sensor Integration.
(a) Ensure all available assets and sensors are tasked to create an
integrated sensor solution to meet the commander’s intent and priorities.
Sensor postures can be offensive, defensive, or neutral. See table 4 for more
information.
Table 4.  Sensor Postures 
Sensor Postures: 
Used during patrols and convoys to provide sensor taskings. 
Neutral 
Lead aircraft’s responsibility is the friendly force. Wing aircraft is 
primarily responsible for scanning the objective (or assigned checkpoint) 
and back to the friendly force. 
Offensive 
Both lead and wing aircraft concentrate on the objective. 
Defensive 
Lead aircraft’s responsibility is the friendly force. Wing aircraft is 
responsible for sanitizing the route directly in front of the friendly force. 
(b) IR markers might be difficult to observe due to cultural lighting. Also,
consider podium effect, direction of observation, and urban canyon situations
with IR markers.
(c) Planners should consider orbit geometry to maximize continuous sensor
fidelity while maintaining safety to ground forces and aircraft.
(d) Electro-optical (EO) and IR sensors require unobstructed LOS with the
objective. Other sensors (i.e., SIGINT, electronic intelligence, and synthetic
aperture radar) may require a specific orbit pattern relative to the objective.
The commander’s priority for selecting collection sensors will determine the
required orbit geometries.
(e) Tasking handover between air assets may be difficult and require more
time in urban environments due to population density (e.g., vehicles and
people), the homogenous nature of urban terrain, differing perspectives of
aircrews, large vertical structures, and urban canyons.
3. Escort
Urban operations provide unique challenges to commanders in regard to planning and 
executing operations. The two primary escort operations in an urban environment are 
escort of airborne and ground elements. 
a. Detailed planning in communications, datalinks, and FMV frequency
management is required to integrate the escort and escorted forces. The
three-dimensional urban environment may drive an increased information flow with
the presence of obstacles, defensive positions, or local populace and its canalizing
effect. The need for increased vigilance for threat protection, coupled with the ability
of the threat to remain camouflaged in the urban terrain, make the task of threat
protection difficult. Consider the threat posture and activity to determine routes,
altitudes, and airspeeds during the planning process.
b. The responsibilities of the escorting aircraft include route reconnaissance,
security, and actions on the objective. Some key elements must be identified,
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
39 
regardless of the escort platform. They are the route (primary and any alternates), 
key terrain, threat identification, fires coordination, and the objective. Planners 
should consider dividing the tasks of route reconnaissance and protection of the 
escorted force. 
c. Convoy security planning considerations are very similar to airborne escort. The
primary differences are the reduced maneuverability and speed of the escorted
force. Whether dismounted or in vehicles, the urban environment provides unique
challenges. It is difficult for escort aircraft to determine friendly positions and
distinguish friendly forces from combatants, which will determine the altitude and
flight profile to mitigate friendly fire incidents. The escorts and escorted force should
consider:
(1) Primary and alternate routes.
(2) Primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency communication plans.
(3) Communications out plan.
(4) Location reporting contracts (e.g., friendly centric, objective centric,
checkpoint centric, and common reference point centric).
d. If available, planners should integrate all available battle-tracking capabilities
(e.g., blue force tracker-Joint Capability Release, Tactical Airspace Integration
System, and Link 16). Battle tracking capabilities will increase SA and allow time to
scan for threats, turn points, and alternate routes.
4. Aviation Fires in Support of Ground Forces
The application of aviation fires in support of ground forces can occur in any phase of 
combat operations. The ground force commander’s intent, the proximity of fires to 
ground forces, and the level of detailed integration will determine the types of fires 
required for an operation. See JP 3-03, Joint Interdiction, and JP 3-09.3 for more 
information. 
a. When a multitude of potential targets are contained in an urban area, numerous
platforms may conduct offensive operations within a congested airspace, depending
on the size of the urban area. In congested airspace, planners must provide aircrews
with airspace coordinating measures that provide effective deconfliction.
b. The urban environment provides excellent cover and concealment for a wide
variety of enemy air defense systems, creates difficulty in locating targets, and
increases CD risks, which can reduce the effectiveness of SEAD operations. If
enemy air defense systems are prevalent in the urban environment, planners must
create a detailed and integrated SEAD plan to protect threatened aviation assets.
c. CAS and Army attack aviation procedures in the urban environment present
unique challenges to aviators. The proximity of friendly forces, enemy forces, and
civilian population in urban environments demand detailed integration of aviation
fires.
40 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(1) A large concentration of ground units in a dense urban area may limit
airspace allotted to each aircraft, reducing the ability to maneuver or react to
threats.
(2) Battle tracking may be particularly difficult. The use of phase lines, TRPs, and
GRGs can aid in maintaining SA as the operation moves through an urban area.
Additionally, communication between ground and air elements may be difficult
due to interrupted LOS. (See Chapter 2, General Planning Considerations.)
(3) Many aircraft are capable of transmitting FMV. JTACs or FAC(A)s can use
aircraft to reconnoiter and engage targets outside the area of immediate
engagement using FMV to confirm targets.
(4) Urban canyons will present challenges for employing weapons requiring
extended trajectory paths. Three-dimensional attack geometry and weapon flight
profiles should be considered for each attack. Urban canyons may limit available
attack headings for aircraft. However, JTACs or FAC(A)s working with aircrews
should attempt to vary ingress and egress flight paths to mitigate the threat to the
attacking aircraft. Additionally, the commander may prefer to use precision-
guided munitions in urban operations to minimize the risk of CD and friendly fire.
However, determining target elevation, due to vertical structures, may be difficult.
See Chapter IV, Weapons Employment, for more details.
d. Air Interdiction. While there are no specific urban characteristics that drastically
alter the conduct of air interdiction missions, there are unique urban planning issues
that must be considered for successful execution. Unlike CAS missions, air
interdiction missions may require aircrews to determine resolutions for PID, CD, and
ROE independently.
(1) An urban environment can degrade the aircrew’s ability to accurately assess
PID, CD, and ROE due to man-made structures, urban canyons, environmental
concerns, and the civilian populace.
(2) An urban environment may present aircrews with an abundance of targets
listed in a commander’s intent and targeting priority guidance. A thorough
understanding of the commander’s target priorities, will allow aircrews to provide
efficient battlefield effects in accordance with the commander’s intent.
5. Air Assault
Air assaults are operations to engage and destroy enemy forces or to seize and hold 
key terrain using assault forces moved by rotary-wing or tiltrotor aircraft. 
a. Capabilities. Air assaults allow friendly forces to vertically maneuver against the
enemy over extended distances and engage enemy forces at unexpected times and
locations. Air assaults allow friendly forces to bypass enemy forces and obstacles
that would prevent or disrupt ground movement. Air assaults are useful in urban
environments where a ground assault would be slow and risky due to canalizing
terrain or would provide the enemy early warning of friendly actions.
b. Specific Urban Considerations.

(1) Available LZs may be limited, which will restrict the number of friendly forces
that can be inserted at one time. Additionally, the enemy may be able to easily
identify potential LZs and emplace obstacles or defensive positions to prevent or
disrupt an air assault.
(2) Structures within the range of the LZ can provide cover and concealment for
enemy forces. Buildings and obstacles around LZs may require aircrews to
perform a slow, deliberate approach to landing, which can increase aircraft
vulnerability to ground fire. These buildings also provide high points of
observation and areas from which to engage rotary-wing and tiltrotor aircraft from
above.
(3) Loose debris and poorly constructed structures may create a hazard when
impacted by rotor wash, which could damage aircraft and injure personnel. The
hazard is greater with larger aircraft.
c. Mitigation and Employment Techniques.
(1) Units must complete a deliberate reconnaissance of LZs, which may be more
difficult and require more time due to obstacles.
(2) If the ground force commander requires simultaneous infiltration of a large
force, LZs outside dense urban terrain may be enlarged, allowing more aircraft to
land simultaneously.
(3) Aircrews should avoid overflight of urban terrain to reduce the risk of
ground-to-air fire and reduce the enemy’s response time to the air assault.
(4) Use pre-assault fires in the objective area to prevent the enemy from placing
effective fires onto the air assault force.
6. Air Movement
Air movement operations involve using aircraft to move troops, equipment, and 
supplies. The same planning sequence and phases used for air assault operations 
apply to air movement operations. Typically, units conduct air movement operations to 
secured LZs. In these operations, aircraft are not necessarily task-organized with other 
members of the combined arms team. Using fixed-wing assets to conduct air movement 
requires a suitable landing area within the urban environment (e.g., airfield under 
friendly control, and road surfaces that would support fixed-wing operations). 
a. Capabilities.
(1) Utility and cargo aircraft provide the commander the ability to move
time-sensitive, mission-critical personnel and cargo rapidly to sustain continuous
offensive and defensive operations.
(2) Air movement is useful when conditions of the urban environment restrict
ground movement or when time is critical.
b. Specific urban considerations and mitigation techniques for LZ selection are
addressed in chapter 2.

7. MEDEVAC and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC)
MEDEVAC and CASEVAC operations move wounded, injured, or ill persons from the 
battlefield, or other areas, to treatment facilities. MEDEVAC is conducted using 
dedicated medical platforms, properly marked and protected by the Geneva 
Conventions, and uses specially trained medical personnel and equipment to provide en 
route care. CASEVAC is conducted using general-mission aircraft with no medical 
markings or protections, and manned by crews who may not have specialized medical 
training. Even when CASEVAC can move a person to treatment faster, the risk of not 
having en route care could outweigh the time saved. Medical personnel should advise 
the commander on whether to use MEDEVAC and CASEVAC, but the availability of 
assets and medical personnel will dictate the method a commander decides to use. In 
the urban environment, the specific nature of these missions have the same 
considerations as air assault and air movement. See JP 4-02, Joint Health Services, for 
more information. 
a. Specific Urban Considerations.
(1) MEDEVAC and CASEVAC operations in the urban environment will be
constrained to limited numbers of suitable landing areas. This restriction
necessitates detailed planning with ground forces. MEDEVAC and CASEVAC
from the point of injury often is impractical.
(2) Noncombatant casualties are more likely to occur in the urban setting, so
commanders must be prepared to use MEDEVAC and CASEVAC assets for
noncombatant casualties. Evacuation priorities will dictate this requirement.
(3) Aircrews must understand the theater evacuation policy and medical rules of
eligibility.
(4) Communication LOS Challenges. MEDEVAC and CASEVAC aircrews should
be prepared to receive relayed communications from overhead aircraft, en route
to an LZ.
b. Mitigation and Employment Techniques.
(1) When possible, MEDEVAC and CASEVAC crews should have a copy of the
scheme of maneuver and operational graphics with marked patient collection
points, ambulance exchange points, and potential LZs.
(2) Hoist-equipped aircraft can evacuate a casualty when landing is impractical,
but extended hovering may put the aircraft at increased risk.
(3) Structures with flat roofs may be used as LZs, but aircrews should plan to
execute an alternate extraction (i.e., one wheel, ramp, or light landing) if the roof
cannot support the weight of the aircraft.
8. Personnel Recovery Operations
Personnel recovery in the urban environment presents multiple challenges. Evasion in 
the urban environment will be slow and difficult, depending on local populace support of 
friendly forces, enemy forces density, and urban density. Therefore, the isolated 
personnel (IP) may have to stay relatively fixed and the rescue force will have to recover 
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
43 
IP at their location. Visual acquisition by overhead aircraft will be difficult and increased 
time and effort to find the IP will be necessary. The urban environment can have 
significant sources of light and heat which may make crash site identification and IP 
observation difficult by overhead aircraft. Aircrew survival radios operate under low 
power and have LOS voice capability with GPS and satellite imbedded data capability. 
The vertical nature of the urban environment can limit the effectiveness of their 
functions. 
a. The designated mission commander will determine whether to conduct an
immediate or deliberate recovery. An immediate recovery is executed with the forces
on hand and reduces the risk to the IP. A deliberate recovery is conducted with
some level of preplanning and reduces the risk to the recovery force. The decision
point should be identified in mission planning to reduce delays in execution. Factors
to consider for making a recovery decision include:
(1) Number and condition of IPs.
(2) Surface, supersurface, and air threats.
(3) Fidelity of the IP’s location.
(4) Proximity to friendly forces.
(5) Environmental factors.
b. As the number of aircraft and ground personnel increase, required planning and
coordination increases. A recovery effort should be executed as soon as a suitable
package can be assembled to increase the chances of a successful recovery and to
mitigate risk.
c. Locating the IP in an urban environment can require a large force and multiple
sensors due to the complexity of the urban environment.
d. If using an LZ, planners must consider the size of the LZ, the distance from the
LZ to the IP’s location, and threats.
e. Considerations for personnel recovery by ground forces:
(1) In a permissive environment, recovery of IP may be expedited by using
friendly ground forces. However, in a contested or congested environment,
recovery by ground forces may be significantly delayed.
(2) Ensure detailed coordination for fires and airspace control between the
ground and airborne forces is complete and continuous until the end of the
recovery mission. The urban environment exacerbates this requirement due to
congested airspace and the density of ground forces (both friendly and enemy).
(3) Detailed frequency planning is required for effective communications.
Consider ground force use of the combat search and rescue (CSAR) common
frequency to begin this coordination in a time-critical environment. As a last
resort, CSAR A and B frequencies may be used.
44 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(4) Establish a geographical point at which the approaching ground force will
establish communication with the on-scene commander and receive approval
before proceeding into the recovery objective area.
f. Considerations for personnel recovery by air assets.
(1) The IP may lack communications.
(2) The IP’s location may not be near suitable LZs.
(3) The on-scene commander must coordinate with the AO owner and
designated airspace control element(s) to gain required fire support coordination
measures and airspace coordinating measures, respectively.
(4) CD from the battle-space owner must be clearly passed and understood by
the aircrew involved in the rescue.
(5) Until the IP is located, use all fires judiciously.
(6) Hoist-equipped aircraft can evacuate the IP when landing is impractical;
however, extended hovering may put the aircraft at risk.
9. Humanitarian Assistance (HA) and Disaster Relief (DR)
HA and DR involve transporting life sustaining aid to displaced persons to alleviate 
suffering, and possibly rescuing or evacuating survivors from unsafe conditions.  
a. Airspace Control. Normal air traffic services may be disrupted or degraded during
HA and DR operations. Due to the high volume of rotary- and fixed-wing and tiltrotor
aircraft involved, consider establishing flight following services, course rules,
mandatory reporting areas, and frequency plans. Civilian SUAS may be operating
without regard to ongoing operations and deconfliction plans. Additionally, during HA
and DR, the military may not control the airspace over the operational area. In these
situations, the military will have to coordinate with civil organizations for airspace
access and control, potentially without the benefit of previous rehearsals or
exercises. For example, over the continental United States, the Federal Aviation
Administration will likely fulfill their normal role as the airspace controlling agency
during HA and DR operations.
b. Local Authorities. Coordination with law enforcement, emergency medical
services, and other local agencies should be considered to prioritize mission tasking
and streamline communications. Imbedding liaison officers with aircrews or C2
elements enables real-time retasking of assets to maximize effectiveness.
c. Orientation. Natural disasters can flood roads, destroy landmarks, affect urban
lighting, and otherwise alter the urban landscape. This can make orientation difficult
for aviation and ground forces.
d. LZ Considerations.
(1) Maintaining security due to population size and distress levels.
(2) Damage of local infrastructure.
(3) Size and suitability of the LZ in the urban environment.
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
45 
(4) Select alternate LZ if primary LZ is unavailable or fouled.
e. Domestic and Foreign Considerations.
(1) Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). DSCA is domestic support
provided by Department of Defense forces, civilians, contractors, and component
assets in response to request for assistance from civil authorities. For more
information, refer to ATP 3-28.1/MCRP 3-30.6/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67/
CGTTP 3-57.1, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Defense
Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA); JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil
Authorities; or Department of Defense Directive 3025.18, Defense Support of
Civil Authorities.
(2) Foreign HA. Department of Defense activities conducted outside the United
States and its territories to directly relieve or reduce human suffering, disease,
hunger, or privation falls under foreign HA. For more information see JP 3-29,
Foreign Humanitarian Assistance.
10. Nonlethal Effects
Planners should consider using nonlethal effects to support operations in the urban 
environment. Determine the priority among denial, disruption, and exploitation 
operations to request support from appropriate liaison officers (e.g., the USMC SIGINT 
deconfliction officer, USAF non-kinetic duty officer, and the USA fires and effects 
coordination center). Planners should deconflict nonlethal effects with other operations. 
a. Nonlethal effects planning considerations for the urban environment include:
(1) Desired geographic scope and target selection.
(2) Layering effects with other assets to deny, degrade, or exploit.
(3) Density and proximity of the civilian populace.
(4) Structural interference of signals.
(5) Method and frequencies used by friendly and enemy forces.
(6) Frequency spectrum saturation and interference.
(7) Integrated cyberspace effects.
(8) Integrated air defense system communication, sophistication, and doctrine.
These considerations can make the effectiveness of creating nonlethal effects 
unpredictable. Creation of nonlethal effects in an urban environment should attempt 
to minimize the negative effects within urban terrain. Aircrews may be required to 
employ nonlethal weapons at closer ranges than in nonurban environments.

Chapter IV 
WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT 
1. Introduction
Considerations for aviation asset weapons employment during urban operations include 
target development, CD constraints, sensor management, and weapons delivery, 
marking, lasing, and sensor employment. 
2. Target Development
a. The ability to identify and engage targets in an urban environment may be
complicated due to the density and height of structures, the population, and the
availability of cover and concealment. Aircrews must consider the secondary effects
of striking dual-use targets and the impact to the civilian population (e.g., dams,
bridges, and airfields).
b. Aircrews will have a limited engagement time from target identification to
weapons employment because the enemy in an urban environment has the ability to
quickly find cover and concealment and move to locations with a high CD concern.
3. Target Acquisition
a. Visual Acquisition.
(1) Daytime acquisition of urban targets can be hindered due to visual cue
saturation and limited marking options.
(2) Nighttime acquisition increases marking options, but excessive light pollution
can affect NVD capabilities.
b. Sensor-aided Acquisition.
(1) Planners and aircrews must consider the limitations of available sensors
(e.g., IR, EO, and television (TV)) based on environmental factors, such as
smoke, haze, and dust.
(2) The requirement for objective fidelity will drive the sensor employment
altitude and standoff, which determines podium and urban canyon effects. These
concepts will be covered in detail later in this chapter and are depicted in figures
14 and 16.
(3) IR systems may detect targets not visible using TV, EO, charge-coupled
device, and direct-view optics systems. However, thermal crossover periods
during sunrise and sunset will degrade IR systems by causing them to lose the
contrast between two adjacent objects.
c. Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) Radar.
(1) Proliferation of traffic on urban roads, highways, and intersections during
daylight hours cause radar correlation and track difficulties.
48 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(2) Vertical structure development can degrade radar acquisition due to masking
and obstruction. When possible, align the radar sweep angle parallel to the
direction of travel.
(3) A GMTI can be advantageous in areas or times of low traffic density (e.g.,
post-curfew hours or an evacuated population center) to conduct a large-area
target search. Also, aircrews can use a GMTI in a focused area search for
movement following lethal weapon employment in which the search area is
obscured due to dust, debris, or haze (e.g., post-weapons engagement or after
an IED explosion).
d. Tactical Data Links and Digital Data Sharing.
(1) Due to the proximity of fires to friendly forces in the urban environment,
planners and operators must consider using all available tools to conduct battle
tracking.
(2) Visual, EO, or IR constraints may drive an increased use of digital
battlespace awareness tools (e.g., fully integrated data link, Link 16, hand-held
tablets, variable message format). Using digital data sharing can increase target
handover efficiency, identify sensor points of interest, and serve as a secondary
communications option.
(3) The increase of electromagnetic interference in the urban environment can
have detrimental effects on tactical data links and LOS communications.
Consider using redundant communications via relay nodes or airborne
controllers.
4. Marking Positions and Targets
a. When working in close proximity to friendly forces, positively identifying friendly
positions and target locations is critical to preventing friendly fire incidents. Due to
increased reliance on marking devices in the urban environment, all participants
must understand the procedures for using the devices and their limitations.
b. Friendly Marking.
(1) Ensure marking methods are visible to air assets, compatible with fielded
systems, and known by all personnel with friendly marking schemes and
capabilities.
(2) Use radar and IR beacons to assist in identifying friendly ground forces in
urban terrain. Standardized use of ground lighting, thermal contrast, and
positional relationship of structures influence the effectiveness of these devices.
(3) Gated laser-intensifier tape, combat identification panels, and smoke present
challenges and could be poor marking devices when used in the urban
environment.
(4) Enemy tactics can reduce the effectiveness of visual markings. Consider
using digital marking methods as an alternate means (e.g. Link 16 and blue force
tracker).
(5) Friendly marking methods may compromise friendly locations.

ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
49 
c. Target Marking.
(1) Positive air-to-ground communications are essential to coordinate and
authenticate markings.
(2) During high and low ambient-light conditions, significant urban shadowing
from buildings can exist. Shadows may hide personnel and vehicular targets from
ground forces and aircrews.
d. Nontraditional Marking. Ground forces may use unconventional methods (e.g.,
spray paint or bed sheets hung out of windows) to mark horizontal and vertical
progress during building clearing operations.
5. Weapon Selection
a. The focus of weapons selection in an urban environment is to determine the
correct type and quantity of lethal or nonlethal weapons required to achieve a
desired effect on a target. Ground force commanders must articulate the desired
effect for targets. Most lethal weapons are designed and built to create one or more
of the following five effects:
(1) Blast. A blast destroys objects through sudden and violent overpressure due
to the expansion of gases. This is not the primary effect against most tactical
targets, but it is useful against buildings. The over pressure within the building
may take down walls and have potentially lethal effects against personnel within
the building.
(2) Fragmentation. The fragmentation effect is from high-velocity pieces of the
munition casing that are propelled outward from the explosion. Normally, this
provides the longest destructive reach from the point of detonation and is
generally the most useful weapon effect.
(3) Armor Penetration. Armor-penetration weapons use shaped-charges or
kinetic-energy penetration warheads to breach protective coverings, such as tank
armor. Penetration generally results in subsequent effects of blast and incendiary
inside the targeted vehicle or structure.
(4) Cratering. The cratering effect is achieved by delaying the fuse function until
the weapon becomes buried in the target. Normally, cratering is intended for
runways or critical transportation routes and may be used to delay or harass
enemy forces. Cratering can significantly affect subsurface areas.
(5) Incendiary. Incendiary effects are created by intense heat, causing the
surrounding material to burn or melt. Incendiary effects often are incorporated
into attack plans as secondary effects.
b. Consider the following when choosing weapons in an urban environment:
(1) Hard, smooth, flat surfaces with 90-degree angles are characteristic of man-
made targets. Weapons achieve maximum penetration from a perpendicular
impact in all relative directions (e.g., azimuth and elevation).
50 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
(2) Due to aerial delivery parameters, munitions may strike an urban structure at
an angle of less than 90 degrees and also may have an adverse azimuth angle.
This can reduce the effects of munitions and increase the chance of ricochets.
(3) Direct-fire weapons may shorten the engagement time necessary for fleeting
targets.
(4) Destroyed targets in an urban environment will cause various types of debris.
Consider the debris effects on friendly, civilian, and enemy freedom of
movement.
(5) Smoke, dust, and shadows mask targets, possibly making close-range
targets indistinct. These effects, along with debris can inhibit the shooter’s and
observer’s ability to observe round impact and conduct battle damage
assessment, which may negatively affect the ability to reengage.
(6) Consider the effect of the weapon and the position of friendly, civilian, and
enemy personnel in relation to the target.
(7) When attacking personnel inside structures, select weapons based on the
desired effects on the target and consider the secondary effects (e.g., building
collapse, fire, and unintended damage to infrastructure).
6. Collateral Damage
a. Engaging targets in an urban environment can be difficult due to CD concerns.
Minimizing CD protects noncombatants and property, facilitates future operations,
and reduces the costs of rebuilding. The presence and proximity of friendly ground
forces and weapons effects are important considerations in weapons selection (e.g.,
using air burst vs. delay munitions) to include secondary munitions effects (e.g.,
burning fires and debris). CD involving personnel can vary depending on the
environment. The following are specific considerations for weapons effects on CD in
an urban environment:
(1) Blast effects create the highest concern for CD to surrounding structures.
(2) Fragmentation effects have the highest risk to personnel; however, they may
cause less damage to surrounding structures.
(3) The most significant concern with armor penetration is CD behind the
intended target. Nonexplosive rounds may penetrate structures in an urban
environment due to an unreinforced building design.
(4) Cratering effects can prevent future use of the infrastructure.
(5) Incendiary effects can cause additional structural weakening and potential for
building collapse. Dense urban environment may increase the opportunity for fire
to spread beyond the target area.
b. Planners and aircrews should consider the following to reduce CD from
secondary effects:
22 FEB 2022 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
51 
(1) Blast induced debris can be a significant hazard to noncombatant personnel.
Many urban combat injuries result from glass shards and falling debris due to
blast and overpressure.
(2) Although some delayed fuse munitions are ideal for urban engagements,
unintentional structural weakening may occur.
(3) In addition to the effects of a deployable munition (e.g., flechette rockets,
illumination rounds, and cluster bomb units), the delivery components can also
cause CD.
(4) Nonexplosive rounds have a higher probability of ricochet than explosive
rounds.
(5) Weapon effects mechanisms can be mitigated by delayed fusing, variable
time fusing, shielding, delivery heading, and aim-point offset. However, mitigation
may decrease the weapons’ effectiveness.
7. Friendly Fire Potential and Avoidance
a. Organized, clear, and effective communication is the most critical element in
preventing friendly fire incidents.
b. Close quarters, identification problems, inaccurate battle tracking, and
unintentional secondary weapons effects increase the potential for friendly fire
incidents during urban operations.
c. Friendly force trackers can be used for battle tracking to help identify the location
of friendly forces. Forces involved in urban operations should understand the
potential limitations with devices for friendly force tracking; specifically the reliability
of friendly position marks due to obscuration, electromagnetic interference, and
latency.
d. Not all marking devices are compatible with all friendly aviation assets and
aircraft systems.
8. Lasing
a. Lasing techniques in the urban environment are susceptible to backscatter,
obscurants, attenuation, beam divergence, spot jitter, refraction, podium effect,
entrapment, and over and under spill.
b. It is critical that the individual lasing a target with a ground designator realizes the
laser energy coming from the designator’s aperture can be seen and tracked by a
missile; in effect, making the ground designator platform a target. Due to the likely
proximity of the laser designator to the target in urban environments, this is more of
a concern than in rural environments.
c. Laser Designation of Reflective Surfaces.
(1) Angled engagements can reflect a compact spot to somewhere other than
the intended target. There can be a high number of reflective surfaces in an
urban environment. A missile can acquire the reflected laser energy and track to
52 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
an unintended location. Employ techniques to mitigate these concerns (see figure 
15). 
(2) A near perpendicular engagement against highly reflective targets (glass,
mirrors, and polished metal) can return dangerously high levels of laser energy to
the designator. Employment of a laser-guided missile (LGM) in an urban
environment requires careful consideration of LOS geometry.
(3) It is possible laser energy can penetrate windows resulting in laser spot
entrapment and failure of the LGM to track laser energy (see figure 15). To
mitigate reflection, place the laser designator on a nonreflective surface adjacent
to the desired aim point.
d. Buddy and Remote Lasing.
(1) Rotary- and fixed-wing platforms can complement each other during the
targeting process. This becomes important due to the vertical structure of the
urban environment and possibility of having an obstructed LOS. Buddy lase may
enhance the lethality and survivability of both platforms. Rotary-wing aircraft
provide laser designation capability, but should limit hover time in a hostile
environment.
(2) When designating with a ground-based laser within an urban canyon, use
caution if LOS geometry only allows the weapon to receive laser energy within
the safety zone. Aircrews should consider employing buddy lasing for LGMs
when urban obstructions preclude the attacking aircraft from maintaining LOS
with the target through ordnance impact. See JP 3-09.3 for more information.
(3) When employing buddy lasing, the terrain may restrict the attack axis due to
the designator’s position.
(a) When lasing for medium-to-high altitude attack aircraft, pick a desired
point of impact on top of a vertically developed structure. Rotary-wing aircraft
can lase for fixed-wing aircraft, but should consider the possibility of spillage
when lasing a horizontal surface at an oblique angle.
(b) When lasing for low-altitude attack aircraft, designators should lase a
vertical surface, not the top of the target, to avoid creating a podium effect (as
illustrated in figure 14). Designators should deconflict the gun and
laser-to-target lines to mitigate podium effects prior to the engagement.

Laser Designation Reflection Considerations 
9. General Weapons Delivery
a. Urban terrain introduces unique challenges to aircrews and ground personnel
due to urban canyons. Urban canyons can shield a target set with vertical structures.
The vertical characteristics of urban terrain can limit delivery options.
54 
ATP 3-06.1/MCRP 3-20.4/NTTP 3-01.04/AFTTP 3-2.29 
22 FEB 2022 
b. Urban terrain creates visibility corridors running between structures. This will
mask street-level targets and subterranean entry points making them only visible
along the street axis or from high angles.
c. Subsurface targets will present significant challenges to weapon delivery.
d. Targeting a specific side or story of a building can limit the engagement heading.
e. Factors, such as threats or weather, may force the aircraft to deliver from a low
altitude. Planners and aircrews must consider obstacle clearance along the
munition’s flight path.
f. Achieving LOS with an objective at surface level is easier when commencing the
attack run along the axis of an urban canyon as illustrated in figure 16.
Attack Along an Urban Canyon 
g. A look-down into areas surrounded by tall structures is required if roadways do
not create an adequate avenue of observation, as illustrated in figure 17.

A View Along a Street (A Low Angle is Possible) 
h. Fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft may experience significantly reduced ordnance
employment ranges in urban areas compared to rural areas. Reasons for this
include the following:
(1) Delivery of direct fire weapons is typically at closer range due to masking
effects of city structures.
(2) The masking structures and their heights will determine the look-down angle
required to achieve LOS.
(3) High-angle deliveries may provide better look-down angles and visibility into
a target area and a better ballistic trajectory when delivering ordnance near tall
structures, as shown in figures 18 and 19.

Look-Down Angle 
i. Confined spaces and unpredictable routes make moving vehicles difficult to
target. Since urban operations inherently generate close-quarters engagements, an
aircraft may not have time to achieve a firing solution on a moving vehicle. Ground
forces must pass fire mission requests to an aircraft as early as possible for the best
firing solution.
j. Post-launch aborts may not be possible in the urban environment where the
chance for CD is increased due to population density. See JP 3-09.3 for further
discussion on post-launch aborts.

10. Rotary-wing Attack Techniques
a. Running and diving fire are the preferred engagement techniques in urban terrain
due to increased weapons accuracy and reduced ability for the enemy to achieve
effective fires.
b. Hovering in urban environments exposes aircraft to small-arms fire while in a
low-energy state. Only plan or execute hovering fire if it is essential to the mission
and adequate overwatch fires are available.
c. Attack rotary-wing aircraft in direct support of ground forces maximize aviation
reconnaissance, security, and attack capabilities to the supported force.
d. Manned-unmanned teaming compatible aircraft should consider the use of
unmanned systems for reconnaissance of the objective area to increase SA, which
will facilitate:
(1) Increased standoff due to positive target identification.
(2) Expedited engagement of previously identified targets.
(3) Remote engagements to maintain the increased standoff.
e. Aerial Sniper Platform in the Urban Environment.
(1) An urban conflict may require employing extremely low-yield, precision fires.
In this case, employing snipers from rotary-wing aircraft offers the commander
great operational flexibility in a CD-sensitive environment.
(2) Sniper teams in an urban environment may occasionally find staying on the
ground to conduct their mission is not feasible or tactically sound. Using an aerial
platform may be a tactically advantageous method to rapidly position a sniper.
Time constraints, possible loss of tactical surprise, and force protection
challenges during sniper infiltration, or post-shot exfiltration are difficulties
associated with ground-mobile snipers.
11. Indirect Fires and Standoff Munitions
a. Indirect fires, such as artillery, mortars, and naval surface fire support, are used
in aviation urban operations for target marking, illumination, SEAD, as a diversion to
mask the sound of rotary-wing aircraft, provide pre-assault fires for LZ occupation, or
to draw attention from the primary attack.
(1) Illumination rounds provide additional light to aid in night operations. They are
used to illuminate areas of suspected enemy activity, provide direction, mark
targets, or wash out enemy passive NVDs when used at ground level.
(2) IR illumination rounds are especially effective in urban areas devoid of
artificial light sources. JIPOE will determine the effectiveness of overt vs. covert
illumination rounds.
(3) Ground forces should coordinate the use of illumination rounds for target
marking with aircrews flying with NVDs because of the increased likelihood of
unwanted smoke and fires which could negatively impact NVD operations.

(4) Artillery can provide effective SEAD fires in the urban environment because
of their high trajectory-firing capability. Aircrews may rely largely on closely
delivered SEAD fire for protection against surface-to-air threats. Closely
coordinate all details of SEAD missions among aircrews, JTACs, observers, and
fire support coordinators. Aircraft and indirect fire separation techniques provide
protection from friendly SEAD fires.
b. Standoff Weapons.
(1) These weapons are designed for long-range employment and require
coordination between JTACs and aircrews to identify precise target location,
impact angle, and fusing options.
(2) Ranges vary between weapon types, and consideration must be given to
terrain, obstructions, routing, and environmental factors when selecting standoff
weapons in the urban environment.
(3) Standoff Considerations.
(a) Minimize target location error when target is in proximity to collateral
objects.
(b) The lack of visibility with the target area may increase friendly or civilian
casualty potential.
(c) GPS jamming, spoofing, or loss can create large targeting accuracy
errors. Requesting GPS planning products and encrypting GPS receivers can
mitigate degradation issues.

Appendix A 
URBAN CAMOUFLAGE, CONCEALMENT, AND DECEPTION 
1. Camouflage
a. Traditional camouflage systems are optimized to blend with a natural
environment. They are designed to make the protected target look like terrain or
vegetation in all spectrums. Camouflage paints and nets have significantly evolved
over the last several years.
b. Urban camouflage may involve a geometric paint pattern, sophisticated
multispectral nets, or improvised camouflage of cardboard, tarps, sheets, and
building debris.
c. Enemy forces may attempt to exploit United States (US) forces’ ROE and friendly
fire reduction techniques by deliberately employing methods of blending with friendly
or neutral forces. Some enemy forces use uniforms nearly indistinguishable from US
uniforms and equipment.
d. Other nations may use military transport trucks with a commercial product logo
and advertising depicted on its sides with an additional false skin applied to the cab,
externally transforming a military vehicle into an apparent commercial truck.
e. The enemy may also use civilian equipment for military purposes. A common
example is the technical, a civilian pickup truck used as a mobile weapon’s platform.
Additionally, civilian vehicles are often used for hauling small arms or vehicle-borne
improvised explosive devices. The volume of civilian traffic present in urban
environments will provide challenges to positively identifying threat vehicles within
the normal patterns of life.
f. Advanced camouflage techniques allow for changing the thermal signature of a
target. This may include thermal blankets, cooling devices, and energy reflective
materials. Another consideration is enemy forces using fires in proximity to their
locations to cause thermal washout effects.
g. The use of structures to mask firing locations (loopholes) create challenges in
identifying the actual point of origin and weaponeering considerations for attack.
2. Deception and Decoys
Decoys are designed to force the shooter to waste time, combat power, and ammunition 
on invalid targets. Decoys can range from very-low to very-high fidelity. On the low end, 
decoys range from a broom stick placed in a window to appear to be a light machine 
gun, to bifurcating smoke grenades leaving multiple hotspots in a smoke cloud to 
counter forward-looking infrared targeting. High-end decoys provide a visible, infrared, 
electromagnetic, or radar signature to misdirect fire to areas of the friendly force 
choosing to dissipate probability of kill against friendly targets.
