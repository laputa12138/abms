Chapter I 
THEATER AIR-GROUND SYSTEM OVERVIEW 
1. Background
a. The Theater Air-Ground System (TAGS) combines each Service’s and special
operations command and control (C2) and airspace control system into a joint
framework, allowing each Service to operate as part of a unified effort in support
of the joint force commander (JFC).
b. TAGS incorporates the Army air-ground system (AAGS), Marine air command
and control system (MACCS), Navy tactical air control system (NTACS), special
operations air-ground system (SOAGS), and the Air Force theater air control
system (TACS) into one joint system. The roles, responsibilities, and authorities
of each TAGS element are spelled out in theaterwide documents, such as the
area air defense plan (AADP), airspace control plan (ACP), and the operations
task link (OPTASKLINK). When delegated tasks and authorities exceed the
component commander’s scope of operations, the responsibilities and authorities
are included in the special instructions (SPINS). The decentralized execution
authorities of components’ TAGS elements are documented in operation plans
(OPLAN), operation orders (commonly referred to as an OPORD), and SPINS.
The airspace control authority (ACA) and area air defense commander (AADC)
must define responsibilities, authorities, and tasks for supporting agencies in the
ACP, AADP, and OPTASKLINK.
(1) This publication describes the structure of TAGS under a single JFC in a
joint operations area (JOA) or area of responsibility (AOR). Regardless of
how the TAGS architecture and organization are structured, the
responsibilities of each TAGS element do not change.
(2) The JFC, through the staff or a designated component, establishes
requirements for the TAGS including the combatant commander’s (CCDR)
guidance, perspective, and strategy for the AOR. The TAGS implementation
directly affects the JFC’s ability to integrate, synchronize, and direct joint
operations. See Joint Publication (JP) 3-0, Joint Campaigns and Operations,
for more information.
(3) A Service component commander also can be a functional component
commander (e.g., the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) may be
the joint force air component commander, (JFACC). Functional component
commanders execute tactical control (TACON) of component forces made
available to them by the JFC through a control system designed for that
purpose, which may be separate from the Service component staff. See
figure 1 for an example of a joint force structure.

22 AUG 2024 
Figure 1. Joint Force Structure 
(4) For the purpose of this publication, the Service component commanders
are designated as the joint component level operational commanders unless
stated otherwise. While joint doctrine states one individual can be a Service
component commander and a joint functional component commander, the
two responsibilities are different and should be executed through different
staffs.
2. Joint Force Commander
a. In this publication, the term JFC refers to a CCDR, subunified commander, or
joint task force (JTF) commander authorized to exercise combatant command
(command authority) (COCOM) or operational control (OPCON) over a joint
force. The JFC has the authority to organize assigned or attached forces to
accomplish the assigned mission. See JP 1, Vol 2, The Joint Force, for more
information. The JFC:
(1) Designates joint force functional component commanders.
(2) Assigns authorities, responsibilities, and missions. Establishes command
relationships and delegates authorities to include: ACA, AADC, joint
personnel recovery coordinator (JPRC), etc.
(3) Allocates resources and apportions assets.
b. The JFC directs the weight of the joint air effort by providing guidance,
objectives, targeting priorities, air apportionment, C2, logistics, joint fire support
coordination measures (FSCM), and rules of engagement. The purpose is to
attain desired effects during each phase of the campaign plan. Additionally, the
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
3 
JFC establishes supported and supporting relationships between the joint force 
component commanders. 
Note: Air apportionment is the JFC’s determination and assignment of the total 
expected air effort (by percentage or priority) devoted to the air operations for a given 
period. Apportionment affects all aspects of joint air operations. See JP 3-30, Joint Air 
Operations for more information. 
c. The TAGS is comprised of the combined component C2 elements. Joint force
components must work together in planning and executing joint air operations
accomplishing JFC-assigned objectives, complying with JFC guidance, and
satisfying component commanders’ requirements. The challenge to personnel
working within the TAGS is to operate a system that is responsive to all
components and supported echelons while accomplishing the JFC’s objectives.
3. Joint Force Air Component Commander
a. The JFC designates the JFACC to establish unity of command and unity of
effort for joint air operations. The JFC designates the COMAFFOR, commander,
Navy forces (commonly referred to as COMNAVFOR) or commander, Marine
forces (COMMARFOR) as the JFACC, predicated upon the ownership of the
preponderance of air assets and the ability to C2 them. The JFC establishes the
JFACC’s authority, command relationships, and responsibilities, which include
TACON over forces made available for tasking. All supporting commands must
ensure liaison elements of the TAGS are in place before beginning operations.
The JFACC plans and tasks joint air operations through the joint air operations
plan (JAOP), air operations directive (AOD), air tasking order (ATO), and other
guidance within a responsive and integrated control system.
b. The joint air operations center (JAOC) is the C2 organization through which
the JFACC plans, coordinates, allocates, controls, and tasks joint air operations.
JFACC responsibilities include the following:
(1) Develop a JAOP to support the JFC’s concept of operations (CONOPS)
or OPLAN. The JAOP contains the commander’s intent for each phase of the
operation.
(2) Recommend air apportionment priorities to the JFC, after considering
objective, priority, or other criteria and consulting with other component
commanders.
(3) Allocate and task air capabilities and forces made available through the
JFC’s air apportionment decision.
(4) Develop daily anticipatory guidance for constructing the AOD. The AOD
contains the JFACC’s intent for specific ATO periods.
(5) Provide oversight and guidance during execution of joint air operations
and make timely adjustments to taskings. The JFACC coordinates with the
JFC and affected component commanders, as appropriate, when the situation
requires changes to planned joint air operations.
4 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
(6) Assess the results of joint air operations and forward the assessments to
the JFC in support of the overall assessment effort.
(7) Perform space coordination duties, if designated by the JFC. The JFACC
may be responsible for coordinating and integrating space capabilities in the
operational area and have primary responsibility for joint space operations,
planning, and requirements within the joint force. See JP 3-14, Space
Operations, for more information.
(8) Coordinate cyberspace operations through the combatant command
(CCMD) joint cyberspace center (JCC) and with the applicable cyberspace
coordination authority. The cyberspace coordination authority requests and
prioritizes cyberspace capabilities and cyberspace planning for the JFACC
mission, in support of the CCDR mission.
Note: Cyberspace effects do not follow the typical air operations center (AOC) air 
tasking cycle given differences in authorities, planning, targeting and weaponeering. 
Coordination requirements shared among the authorities for cyberspace effects and 
AOC lethal/nonlethal effects must be resolved due to deconfliction and synchronization 
of joint operations responsibilities. In most cases, the JCC uses portions of the AOC air 
tasking cycle to solve the deconfliction and synchronization problem. See JP 3-30 for 
additional information on the air tasking cycle. 
(9) Perform JPRC duties. See JP 3-50, Personnel Recovery, for a detailed
discussion of personnel recovery (PR).
(10) Collection authority (Ch III 2.c).
(11) Perform tasks within the following mission areas:
(a) Counterair (defensive counterair (DCA) and offensive counterair
(OCA)).
(b) Close air support (CAS).
(c) Airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and
incident awareness and assessment.
(d) Air mobility operations.
(e) Strategic attack.
(f) Air interdiction (AI).
• The JFACC is the supported commander for the JFC’s overall AI
effort.
• The JFACC is the supporting commander to the joint force land
component commander (JFLCC) and joint force maritime component
commander (JFMCC) for AI within their area of operations (AO).
c. The JFC normally designates the JFACC as the ACA. The ACA must
integrate and coordinate the airspace requirements with host nation countries, all
components, and multinational forces on behalf of the JFC. The ACA normally
delegates airspace control to elements of the airspace control system (ACS). The
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
5 
ACS requires timely exchange of information through reliable, secure, and 
interoperable communications networks. In addition to ACA/airspace 
management, these airspace control elements are often delegated additional 
authorities. To enable ATO execution, the airspace control elements perform 
roles that include air battle management (e.g., C2 joint air operations), air 
defense (combat identification, early warning, weapons control status, target 
tracking, DCA), and/or surveillance and reconnaissance. Reference JP 3-52, 
Joint Airspace Control, for more information. ACA responsibilities include: 
(1) Developing broad policies and procedures for airspace control and
coordination required of all users of airspace within the airspace control area.
(2) Establishing an ACS that integrates host and other affected nations’
constraints and requirements.
(3) Coordinating and deconflicting airspace requests based on operational
usage requirements. Publishing and disseminating the airspace control order
(ACO) that implements specific control procedures for established time
periods.
(4) Promulgating ACS policies and procedures via the JFC-approved ACP.
Centralized direction by the ACA does not imply assumption of OPCON or
TACON over any air assets.
d. The JFC normally designates the JFACC as the AADC. The AADC is
responsible for DCA operations, which include the integrated air defense system
for the JOA. DCA and OCA operations combine as the counterair mission, which
is designed to attain and maintain the degree of control of the air and protection
desired by the JFC. In coordination with the component commanders, the AADC
develops, integrates, and distributes a JFC-approved AADP. Typically, for forces
made available for DCA, the AADC retains TACON of air sorties, while surface-
based air and missile defense forces (e.g., phased array tracking radar to
intercept of target (PATRIOT) missile systems) may be provided in support from
another component commander. As such, the Army air and missile defense
command (AAMDC) should be collocated with the JAOC, if established, and
conduct collaborative intelligence preparation of the battlefield, planning, and
execution control. In distributed operations, the AAMDC may not be in the JAOC
but is still functionally tied to it. The Navy component commander (NCC) or
JFMCC, if designated exercises OPCON of maritime multimission and missile
defense ships. When designated, these air and missile defense capabilities are
in direct support of the AADC for C2 and execution of air defense.
(1) Area Air Defense Considerations. DCA operations are integrated with
other air operations within the operational area through the AADP and ATO.
The AADC normally develops an integrated air defense system by integrating
the capabilities of different components with a robust C2 architecture.
Because of their time-sensitive nature, DCA operations require streamlined
coordination and decision-making processes, facilitated by the AADP. The
AADP is the integration of active air defense design, passive defense
measures, and the C2 system to provide a comprehensive approach to
6 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
defending against the threat. It should address command relationships, the 
enemy, adversary, and friendly situations, the AADC's intent, CONOPS, and 
logistics and C2 requirements, as well as detailed weapons control and 
engagement procedures. Weapons control procedures and airspace control 
procedures for all air defense weapon systems and forces must be 
established. These procedures facilitate DCA operations while minimizing the 
risk of friendly fire incidents. Planners are routinely required to modify the 
AADP due to the dynamic nature of joint counterair operations. The AADP 
should also be integrated with the ACP to ensure airspace control 
areas/sectors are synchronized with air defense regions/sectors. Ideally, as 
the JFC's operation/campaign progresses and the AADP is refined, the 
combination of DCA and OCA operations should diminish the enemy's ability 
to conduct air and missile attacks, reducing the requirement for DCA 
operations and the threat to the JFC's freedom of action. 
(2) AADC responsibilities include the planning, integration, synchronization,
and coordination of DCA operations with other tactical operations throughout
the JOA. This may be facilitated by the JFC's designation of regional air
defense commanders (RADC) and/or sector air defense commanders
(SADC) to enhance decentralized execution of DCA. Additional AADC
responsibilities include:
(a) Develop, integrate, and distribute a JFC-approved AADP in
coordination with Service and functional components.
(b) Appoint a deputy AADC, as required, to advise on how to integrate
and synchronize Service component DCA capabilities and assets.
(c) Develop and execute a detailed plan to disseminate timely air and
missile warning and cueing information to components, forces,
multinational partners, and civil authorities, as appropriate, in coordination
with the intelligence directorate of a joint staff (J-2), the operations
directorate of a joint staff (J-3), and the communications system
directorate of a joint staff (commonly referred to as J-6).
(d) Develop and implement identification and engagement procedures
that are appropriate to the air and missile threats.
(e) Establish timely and accurate track reporting procedures among
participating units to provide a consistent common tactical picture.
(f) Make DCA recommendations after consultation with DCA
representatives from the joint force components.
(g) Make OCA attack operations recommendations to help counter the air
and missile threat.
(h) See JP 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats and JP 3-30 for more
information on AADC responsibilities.

4. Joint Force Land Component Commander
The JFLCC’s responsibilities are to plan, coordinate, and employ forces and capabilities 
as made available for tasking in support of the JFC. See JP 3-31, Joint Land 
Operations, for more detailed information. The responsibilities of the JFLCC include: 
a. Provide options to the JFC for employing assigned and attached forces.
b. Develop the joint land operations plan, and operational orders to support the
JFC and maximize land combat power throughout the JOA.
c. Provide mutual support to other components by conducting land-based
operations such as suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), threats to
maritime operations, and the physical locations of cyberspace and space threats.
d. Provide an assistant or deputy to the AADC for land-based joint theater
integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) operations and coordination.
5. Joint Force Maritime Component Commander
a. The JFMCC’s responsibilities are to plan, coordinate, and employ forces and
capabilities made available for tasking in support of the JFC. See JP 3-32, Joint
Maritime Operations for more detailed information.
b. The Navy forces (NAVFOR) component of a JFMCC has an organic, robust
IAMD system. The NAVFOR provides:
(1) IAMD along the littorals and seaward across the maritime AO.
(2) Aircraft sorties for DCA and OCA tasking under TACON of the JFACC or
AADC.
(3) SADCs or RADCs.
c. The Fleet Marine Forces (FMF) may be part of the JFMCC for certain
maritime- centric operations such as an amphibious operation. Once established
as a land force, the FMF may remain under the JFMCC, serve as a Service
component force, or become subordinate to the JFLCC.
6. Joint Force Special Operations Component Commander
The Joint Force Special Operations Component Commander (JFSOCC) exercises C2 
of assigned or attached special operations forces (SOF) and is responsible for making 
recommendations on the employment of assigned, attached, or made-available- for-
tasking SOF assets; planning, coordinating, and synchronizing special operations (SO) 
with other components; or accomplishing operational missions as assigned. The CCDR, 
in conjunction with United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the 
theater special operations component commander, designates the special operations 
joint task force (SOJTF) commander as the JFSOCC when a JFSOCC is required. The 
Commander, United States Special Operations Command (CDRUSSOCOM) exercises 
COCOM of all SOF. The CCDR exercises OPCON of assigned or attached SOF 
through the commander, theater special operations command (CDRTSOC) or JFSOCC. 
See JP 3-05, Joint Doctrine for Special Operations, for more detailed information.

7. Operational Liaisons
a. Liaison between forces is essential for coordinated and effective joint air
operations. Component commanders exchange liaison elements to assist and
coordinate the planning and execution of their component's operations with joint
air operations. Liaison elements provide senior-level interface for air, land,
maritime, space, cyberspace, and SOF. These elements consist of personnel
who provide component planning and tasking expertise, coordination capabilities,
and the ability to deconflict component operations and joint air operations. A brief
summary follows of typical liaison elements. Reference JP 3-30 for more
information.
b. Liaisons to the JTF. A joint air component coordination element (JACCE) may
be assigned to the JTF by the theater JFACC. The JACCE provides direct
communication and facilitates coordination between the JTF and the theater
JFACC. The JACCE possesses the authority to represent the theater JFACC on
critical issues and assists the JTF in air support planning functions. Additionally,
a JACCE may also be assigned to a component commander as needed (e.g.,
JFLCC, JFMCC, etc.). The joint force liaison structure to the JFACC is shown in
figure 2.
Figure 2. Liaisons to the JFACC 
c. Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD). The BCD is the primary liaison
from the commander, Army forces (COMARFOR) to the JAOC. It is a standing
organization, assigned to an Army Service component command (ASCC) and
located with the Air Force AOC supporting a CCDR. The BCD coordinates the
ground maneuver commander’s plan with supporting air operations. The BCD
integrates with the JAOC and participates in joint C2 processes (i.e., the joint air
tasking cycle). See Field Manual (FM) 3-94, Armies, Corps, and Division

for more information. 
d. Marine Liaison Element (MARLE). The MARLE is provided as the Marine
Corps’ contribution to the liaison staff within the AOC. The MARLE consists of
trained personnel who provide component planning and tasking expertise and
coordination capabilities on behalf of the Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF)
commander. They help integrate and coordinate MAGTF operations with joint air
operations.
e. Special Operations Liaison Element (SOLE). The SOLE is the JFSOCC’s
liaison to the JFACC in the JAOC. The SOLE deconflicts all SOF air, surface,
and subsurface activities with operations involving JFACC assets.
f. Naval and Amphibious Liaison Element (NALE). The NALE is the primary
liaison from the NAVFOR commander to the JAOC. The NALE processes
NAVFOR requests for air support and monitors and interprets the maritime battle
situation for the JAOC. The NALE serves as the interface for exchanging
operational and intelligence data, coordinates maritime requirements for air
defense support, provides interdiction, and monitors Navy-controlled airspace
and air traffic control (ATC) requirements.
g. Air Force Liaison Element (AFLE). When the JFACC is not the COMAFFOR,
the COMAFFOR provides an AFLE from the Air Force forces (AFFOR) staff as
an interface to the JFACC for coordinating and synchronizing Air Force units in
support of joint air operations. The AFLE is not a standing AFFOR element and is
established only when required.
h. Liaisons to the JFLCC. The JFACC has access to the JFLCC and the joint
operations center (JOC) staff through the JACCE. The JACCE works for the
JFACC and works with the JFLCC and JOC staff. The JACCE provides direct
communication and facilitates coordination between the JFLCC and the JFACC.
The JACCE possesses the authority to represent the JFACC on time sensitive
and critical issues and assists the JFLCC in air support planning functions. A
special operations command and control element (SOCCE) is the focal point for
the synchronization of SOF activities with conventional forces activities.
i. Liaisons to the JFMCC and JFSOCC. Other component commanders may
require access to the JFMCC and the JFSOCC. The JFACC may establish one
or more JACCE with other components (e.g., JFMCC or JFSOCC) or supported
JTF headquarters (HQ) to integrate air component operations with their
operations. Other components may provide the JFMCC and JFSOCC liaisons.
Figure 3 shows an example of the interface between the JFACC and the JFMCC.

8. Theater Air-Ground System Planning Considerations
When conducting operations in contested or degraded operational environments, 
commanders must plan for potentially reduced effectiveness of TAGS elements. It is 
important to develop alternate C2 architectures to maintain the TAGS’ effectiveness. 
Commanders can tailor the TAGS for a wide range of military operations across the 
competition continuum to include operations below the level of armed conflict and 
operations in denied or degraded environments, as in the following list: 
a. Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO). The competition for airspace,
communications, and the timing and priority of missions present challenges. The
TAGS enables all components to participate in the decision-making process,
synchronizing efforts to meet the JFC’s guidance.
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
11 
b. Limited Contingency Operations. These operations present a unique
challenge as they often involve a combination of military forces operating in close
proximity with host nation an interorganizational participants. Although limited
contingency operations are typically narrow in scope, scale, and focus, they
present a challenge for commanders and may require CCDRs and JFCs to tailor
the TAGS to meet requirements. This may include providing additional liaisons to
host nation or interagency organizations.
c. Sustainment operations create airspace management and fires integration
challenges as host nation stability conditions are established. The static and
repetitive nature of stability operations allow the commander to tailor the TAGS to
become more efficient.
d. Humanitarian Assistance. Integrating TAGS with civil, military, foreign
governments, or nongovernmental organizations during humanitarian assistance
or disaster relief missions may be necessary. In these instances, some TAGS
elements may not be available for tasking and planners should identify measures
to address shortfalls.

Chapter II 
Army Air-Ground System 
1. Background
a. The AAGS is a vital part of the Army C2 system that connects to the TACS to
enable air-ground operations. AAGS is the Army’s control system for
synchronizing, coordinating, and integrating air operations with the ground
commanders’ operational objectives.
b. The AAGS provides the framework for initiating and processing component air
support requests, collection requirements, airspace integration, joint fires, air and
missile defense (AMD), and liaison exchanges. The AAGS and TACS enhance
air-ground operations for their components by conducting critical functions and
creating effects for joint operations.
c. The Army forces (ARFOR) is the Army component of any joint force and the
senior Army HQ of all Army forces assigned or attached to a CCMD, subordinate
joint force command, joint functional command, or multinational command. The
theater Army initially maintains control of all Army units assigned to an AOR until
control is passed to the senior Army forces commander in a JOA.
d. Airspace. Commanders at all echelons have the responsibility to plan,
coordinate, integrate, and regulate assigned and supporting airspace users
within their AO. Airspace management is an inherent responsibility of
commanders to manage their forces/assets in the air domain per the prescribed
directives and guidance.
2. Echelons of Command
Understanding the roles and functions of the various echelons of command is essential 
to understanding the functionality of the AAGS. Armies, corps, and divisions (DIV) 
provide the joint force with flexible and tailorable formations and HQ. Armies, corps, and 
DIVs conduct operations across the competition continuum as part of a joint and 
multinational force. Figure 4 displays elements of the TACS/AAGS. 
a. Theater Army. The theater Army is the ASCC for a CCMD and recommends
the allocation and employment of ARFOR and on other matters for which the
Army is responsible. With augmentation, the theater Army may serve as the JTF
HQ, JFLCC for limited contingency operations, or be the theater JFLCC when
designated by the CCDR. See FM 3-94 for more information.

22 AUG 2024 
Figure 4. TACS/AAGS 
b. Field Army. When constituted by a JFC or theater Army commander, the field
Army is established, manned, and equipped to perform roles as an ARFOR in a
joint force for LSCO or serve as a JFLCC commanding multiple Army corps and
Marine forces. The field Army performs ARFOR and joint roles during
competition that exceed a corps’ capability and enables the theater ASCC to
maintain its AOR-wide orientation.
c. Corps. In LSCO, corps HQ normally function as an operational land HQ under
the joint land component. The corps HQ is organized, trained, and equipped to
control the operation of two to five DIVs with supporting organizations. Joint
capabilities are the primary means available to the corps commander for setting
conditions and shaping the environment for DIV operations. When operating
independently during large-scale combat, the corps may serve as the ARFOR, or
as the nucleus for a JFLCC or JTF HQ, but it requires significant joint force
augmentation.
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
15 
d. DIV. The DIV’s primary role in LSCO is as a tactical formation commanding
two to five Army brigade (BDE) combat teams (BCT) with two to four functional
and multifunctional brigades. The DIV may fulfill the ARFOR role for operations
of limited scope and duration. Under such conditions, it may form the nucleus for
a very small-scale JTF or JFLCC.
e. BCT. The BCT is the Army’s primary combined arms close combat force
whose versatility and modularity are effective across the land domain. There are
three types of BCTs: armored, infantry, and Stryker. BCTs:
(1) Have organic capabilities across the warfighting functions, C2,
movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and
protection.
(2) Can be task organized by higher echelon commanders for specific
missions.
(3) Typically have two to three maneuver battalions (BN), a cavalry
squadron, a field artillery BN, a sustainment BN, and an engineer
BN.
f. BN. BN organizations are tactical units assigned or attached to brigades. The
BN is the smallest Army echelon with a command post (CP) and staff to execute
the operations process that results in published formal orders.
3. Army Air-Ground System Integration
a. Joint air-ground integration is achieved by nesting the Army’s operations and 
processes with the joint air tasking cycle. The Army processes preplanned 
support requests through the Army chain of command. The COMARFOR 
provides guidance on timing for the following requests:
(1) Immediate joint tactical air strike requests (JTAR) (Department of 
Defense form, DD Form 1972, Joint Tactical Air Strike Request).
(2) Preplanned Air support requests (AIRSUPREQ) (D670).
(3) Airspace coordinating measures requests (ACMREQ) (F658).
(4) Allocation requests (ALLOREQ) (A655).
(5) Air mission request status/tasking (A661).
(6) Collections requirements in support of component planning and 
preparation.
b. The Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) is responsible for direction and 
control of joint air operations in direct support of ground forces. The ASOC is 
aligned at the Army echelon above brigade (EAB) most capable of integrating 
fires and effects and procedural control. Normally the ASOC will operate at the 
DIV level to serve as part of the joint air-ground integration center (JAGIC) that 
controls division-assigned airspace. ASOCs will be aligned with associated DIVs 
to develop teamwork and maintain combat readiness. The tactical air control 
party (TACP) consists of air liaison officers (ALO) and joint terminal attack 
controllers (JTAC) integrating joint capabilities to create desired effects to
16 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
support the ground scheme of maneuver. TACPs support maneuver elements at 
the corps, DIV, BDE, and BN levels, but may be employed at any echelon in 
support of specific missions of limited duration.  
4. Army Air-Ground System Elements
a. The senior Army echelon is responsible for the operation of the AAGS,
especially the BCD, AAMDC, and ground liaison detachments (GLD).
Note: Collective and individual tasks to develop unit training plans are available for 
download at the Army Training Network (https://atn.army.mil) and the Central Army 
Registry (https://rdl.army.mil/catalog/dashboard). 
b. The supported commander accomplishes the following tasks to leverage joint
assets:
(1) Exchange liaisons with the supporting commands, ensuring integration
into the supported and supporting elements. Elements must incorporate
liaisons into battle rhythms with a clear understanding of the supported
commander’s intent, CONOPS, plans, and current operations.
(2) Identify external support requirements for the supporting command to
plan, prepare, and execute per the JFC’s approved battle rhythm.
(3) Define support requirements to include the CAS distribution decision.
(4) Coordinate operations with other affected components and the JFC.
(5) Make air apportionment recommendation to the JFC.
c. When requirements exceed organic capabilities, the senior Army HQ
consolidates, approves, and sends preplanned AIRSUPREQs to the BCD at the
JAOC. All Army units’ airspace requirements are identified by sending
ACMREQs  through the AAGS to the ARFOR; the ARFOR sends a consolidated
unit airspace plan (UAP) and ACMREQs to the BCD for inclusion in the ACO.
d. A BCD is an Army unit assigned to an ASCC functioning as the primary
interface between the JFLCC and JFACC. The BCD coordinates the ground
maneuver commander’s plan and supporting air operations. The BCD integrates
with the JAOC and participates in joint C2 processes (i.e., the joint targeting
cycle and the joint air tasking cycle). The BCD:
(1) Articulates the COMARFOR’s or JFLCC’s requests and requirements for
air operations in support of the ground CONOPS.
(2) Coordinates with, and receives, objectives, guidance, and priorities from
the COMARFOR and staff. The COMARFOR staff must continuously advise
the BCD on matters pertaining to current and future operations and air
support requirements.
(3) Processes preplanned AIRSUPREQs and ACMREQs.
(4) Monitors and interprets the land battle situation for JAOC personnel and
provides the interface for exchanging current intelligence and operational data
between the ARFOR and JAOC. See Army techniques publication (ATP) 3-

09.13, The Battlefield Coordination Detachment, for more information on the 
BCD. 
e. The GLD is an Army liaison element assigned to the ASCC, OPCON to each
BCD, and co-located at operational Air Force flying squadrons or wings.
(1) GLDs advise Air Force commanders on Army organizations, ground force
operations, tactics, capabilities, doctrine, and air support requirements. A
GLD consists of one combat arms officer, called the ground liaison officer,
and one fire support noncommissioned officer equipped with organic Army
communication systems.
(2) GLDs serve as information conduits between the supporting air
components and supported Army units. GLDs brief aircrews on the supported
Army unit commander’s intent and CONOPS. They also provide updates on
the ground tactical situation, targets, and JTARs.
(3) GLDs debrief aircrews after missions and provide operational and
intelligence data to the BCD. GLDs may be afloat with a carrier strike group
(CSG) or expeditionary strike group (ESG) when Navy air assets are
supporting ARFOR.
f. The reconnaissance liaison detachments (RLD) provide liaison and
coordination with Air Force reconnaissance squadrons. RLDs ensure supporting
assets satisfy requests for aerial collection and meet the supported commander’s
current collection priorities.
g. The commander, AAMDC, is designated the theater Army air and missile
defense coordinator by the theater Army commander or the JFLCC (if
established).
h. The AAMDC:
(1) May be designated as a deputy AADC.
(2) Participates in developing the AADP.
(3) Coordinates with joint partners to develop procedures for AMD operations
and interoperability.
(4) Plans, coordinates, integrates, and executes AMD for the CCDR/JFC,
COMARFOR, or JFLCC.
(5) Provides BCD with AMD analysis for intelligence preparation of the
battlefield development and refinement.
(6) Provides AMD target nominations for high payoff targets. See Army
doctrine publication (ADP) 3-19, Fires, and JP 3-01 for more information.
i. The air defense artillery fire control officer (ADAFCO) is the single point of
contact between Army land-based AMD fire direction centers and the joint or
Army controlling authority.
(1) The AAMDC ADAFCO and a Navy liaison for the advanced electronic
guided interceptor system (better known by the acronym AEGIS) are located
18 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
with the AADC or JFACC and the senior air defense officer (SADO) at the 
JAOC. They are responsible for coordinating and deconflicting upper-tier 
ballistic missile engagements. The AAMDC ADAFCO maintains 
communications with the air defense artillery (ADA) BDE ADAFCOs at the 
RADC’s or SADC’s location to share situational awareness with the mission 
crew commanders or senior weapons directors. 
(2) ADA BDE ADAFCOs are located with a control and reporting center
(CRC), on an aircraft carrier, amphibious assault ship, cruiser, destroyer, at a
tactical air operations center (TAOC), or an Airborne Warning and Control
System (AWACS).
(3) The ADA BDE ADAFCO is responsible for lower-tier engagements within
a particular region or sector. Lower-tier engagements include terminal phase
engagements of ballistic missiles, air-surface missiles, and air breathing
threats (aircraft and cruise missiles). The ADAFCO is the Army’s link between
PATRIOT missile units and the joint controlling agency and issues all fire
control orders to their subordinate units.
j. ADA BDEs support theater-level operations using Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) and PATRIOT assets and can provide additional forces, which
include counter-rocket, artillery, mortar system of systems, and short-range air
defense capabilities. ADA forces at the BDE level are employed to protect
operational forces and assets from air and missile attack. The ADA BDE
commander advises the AAMDC commander on overall counter-air and AMD
integration, synchronization, and employment. ARFOR ADA BNs are task
organized under ADA BDEs to defend designated assets. ADA short-range BNs
are also organic to DIVs and support DIV and BCT operations.
k. CPs are where commanders and staff perform the operations process to
synchronize the warfighting functions, targeting, and integrating air-ground
operations. Army forces field a variety of CPs, to include: a main CP, tactical CP
or its equivalent, rear CP, and mobile command group. At the corps level and
below, every echelon of command has a main CP and a tactical CP. Corps and
DIVs are also equipped with a rear CP and mobile command group, giving them
the flexibility to control deep, close, and rear areas. Unit standard operating
procedures (SOP) provide detailed procedures for the CPs. See ATP 6-0.5,
Command Post Organization and Operations for CP operations and FM 3-0,
Operations for CP varieties.
(1) Main CP. This is an operations center containing the majority of the staff
and is designed to control current operations, conduct detailed analysis, and
plan future operations.
(2) Tactical CP. This facility contains a tailored portion of a unit HQ and is
designed to control portions of operations for a limited time.
(3) Rear CP. The rear CP typically has responsibility for rear operations that
include sustainment operations, defeating threats, support area security, risk
22 AUG 2024

19 
mitigation of areas not assigned to subordinate units, terrain management, 
movement control, consolidating gains, and conducting stability operations. 
l. Fires Support Element (FSE) and Fires Cell (FC). The corps FSE and theater
FC plan, coordinate, integrate, and synchronize the employment and assessment
of organic and supporting fires with JFLCC operations. The DIV FSE or DIV
JAGIC (if formed), BDE FSE, and BN FSE plan, prepare, execute, and assess
fires in support of current and future operations. These FSEs back-brief targeting
guidance to the commander in accordance with the commander’s intent for fires
and maneuver. FSEs:
(1) Develop high priority targets.
(2) Prioritize targets for attack.
(3) Match targets to a wide range of targeting and delivery systems.
(4) For more information about the FSE reference JP 3-09, Joint Fire
Support.
m. Air defense cells are organic to corps, DIVs, and BDEs. Air defense airspace
management (ADAM) cells in BCTs and AMD sections in DIVs and corps. Each
air defense cell contributes to the commander’s situational awareness by
providing a unit level tactical air picture. These elements are responsible for
synchronizing AMD operations with the commander’s scheme of maneuver,
resolving immediate airspace conflicts, and coordinating with other Army and
joint AMD units for early warning and complementary defense coverage from
enemy air and missile threats.
n. The ADAM cell is organic to a BCT. It provides the BDE commander
situational understanding of the airspace and early warning via connectivity with
airspace users and mission partners’ sensors and command networks. The
ADAM cell continuously plans for, controls, and monitors the operations of all
airspace users supporting BCT operations and those transiting through the
airspace over their ground commander’s AO. The ADAM cell is integrated with
the BDE aviation element (BAE).
o. The BAE supports the BCT as a dedicated planning and coordination cell
which integrates and synchronizes Army aviation operations with the ground
commander’s scheme of maneuver, fires plan, and UAP. The BAE coordinates
with the supporting aviation BDE or task force for Army aviation mission
requirements. The BAE is also responsible for integrating airspace requirements
in the BCT UAP and submits airspace requirements to its higher HQ. The BAE is
integrated with the ADAM cell.
p. The airspace element (AE) is a G-3 staff element at the DIV, corps, and
higher Army echelon. Airspace management is also performed by BDE ADAM
elements. The AE and/or ADAM personnel are the commanders’ experts to
coordinate the use of airspace. Together, with the staff and supporting liaisons,
the AE identifies all airspace requirements to integrate other warfighting functions
(fires, intelligence, movement and maneuver, etc.) into the airspace plan. See
FM 3-52, Airspace Control, and JP 3-52 for more detailed information.
20 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
(1) Planning and managing the use of airspace is a continuous activity of the
Army’s operations process and focuses on setting conditions for near-real-
time airspace coordination during mission execution.
(2) AE’s provide airspace control subject matter expertise throughout the
military decision-making process, targeting, and current operations.
(3) The AE’s primary requirement is to develop a daily UAP, via the Tactical
Airspace Integration System (TAIS), that supports future operations. BDEs
identify their airspace users’ requirements and send their UAP to their DIV
AE. This continues through the AAGS to the senior Army echelon AE who
provides a consolidated UAP to the BCD per the joint force battle rhythm.
q. The fire support team (FIST). The FIST provides maneuver companies and
reconnaissance troops with fire support coordination, targeting, input for terminal
attack control, and assessment capabilities.
r. Joint fires observers are trained Service members who can request, adjust,
and control surface-to-surface fires. They provide targeting information in support
of Types 2 and 3 CAS terminal attack control and perform autonomous terminal
guidance operations.
s. A field artillery BDE’s primary task is conducting corps-level strike operations.
It is capable of employing Army fires and incorporating electromagnetic warfare.
In addition, a BDE can request joint fires and coordinate with airspace control
elements. The field artillery BDE can detect and attack targets using a mix of its
organic target acquisition, fires capabilities, and supporting information collection
capabilities.
(1) When a field artillery BDE is attached to a corps, the BDE commander
becomes that corps’ fire support coordinator (FSCOORD) and is the primary
advisor to the corps commander for integration of Army and joint fires. The
field artillery BDE commander may designate the corps chief of fires as the
deputy fire support coordinator (DFSCOORD).
(2) For more information on the field artillery BDE reference ATP 3-09.24,
The Field Artillery Brigade and FM 3-0.
t. The senior field artillery commander at each echelon serves as the maneuver
commander’s FSCOORD to orchestrate fires. The DIV artillery commander is
normally the DIV commander’s FSCOORD. The DIV chief of fires may be
designated the DFSCOORD. The DFSCOORD is responsible for targeting and
integrating effects, overseeing assigned fire support personnel, and has
coordinating responsibility for the ALO, cyberspace electromagnetic warfare
officer (CEWO), the DIV space support element, and the JAGIC (when formed).
u. The JAGIC is optimally located in the Army DIV current operations integration
cell. The JAGIC provides the commander a technique to coordinate, integrate,
and control operations in DIV-assigned airspace and coordinate requirements
with external airspace elements outside of the DIV area. The JAGIC consists of
existing systems and personnel in the DIV and supporting air support operations
squadron that makes up the ASOC and TACP. The JAGIC is a team of teams
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
21 
when the JAGIC chief and the Air Force senior air director are co-located to 
make timely decisions as delegated by the DIV commander, the JFACC, and 
ACA. For more information, reference ATP 3-91.1, The Joint Ground Integration 
Center. 
v. The combat aviation BDE (CAB) synchronizes the operations of multiple
aviation BNs conducting simultaneous operations from single or multiple
locations in the AO. The CAB must prepare to fight as a maneuver BDE, provide
support to BCTs, or conduct multiple, independent missions. Aviation forces
operate as part of the combined arms team integrated at the BCT level and
higher. Each CAB has an organic air traffic service company that establishes and
operates airfields in support of DIV operations.
w. Theater Fires Command (TFC) and Theater Fires Element (TFE). An Army
TFC or TFE provides C2 of assigned fires capabilities, serves as the senior
organization assigned to a theater army to integrate allocated or assigned fires
capabilities, and executes critical fire support functions in all phases of unified
land operations. The organizational difference between these organizations is
minimal. The TFC or TFE ensures the Army’s contribution to the joint targeting
process is effectively planned and executed during competition and crisis and
can quickly transition to LSCO in accordance with the ground commander’s
priorities. See FM 3-09 for additional information on the TFC and TFE.
x. Multidomain Task Force (MDTF). The MDTF provides the joint force with a
formation capable of employing long-range precision fires and other effects from
multiple domains in support of the commander’s objectives. When required, it
can be task-organized to provide capabilities to the JFC or a component
commander.

Chapter III 
Air Force Theater Air Control System 
1. Background
This chapter focuses on the Air Force’s contribution to the TAGS and includes all the 
C2-related capabilities and activities associated with air, space, cyberspace, and related 
support operations. 
a. Battle management (BM) is visualizing where forces are in time and space,
when they will be at specific locations, and applying capabilities against specific
threats. BM:
(1) Allows direct (real-time) monitoring and executing of operations.
(2) Synchronizes and integrates efforts with other joint air operations.
(3) Facilitates unity of effort.
(4) Reduces the expenditure of resources and risk of friendly fire.
(5) Requires building and maintaining situational awareness, managing
available resources, and directing and controlling execution.
b. The JFACC establishes battle management areas (BMA) to support effective,
decentralized execution and distributed control of air operations and delegated
ACA and AADC responsibilities. See Appendix C, Battle Management Areas, for
more information.
c. The AFFOR staff is the mechanism through which the COMAFFOR exercises
OPCON and administrative control (ADCON) responsibilities across all assigned
air forces. These responsibilities include:
(1) Deploying, basing, sustaining, and redeploying AFFOR.
(2) During steady-state operations, the AFFOR staff supports the
COMAFFOR in operational and administrative responsibilities.
(a) The operational responsibilities include planning, executing, and
assessing steady-state operations in support of the CCDR’s theater
campaign plan.
(b) The administrative responsibilities include activities for organizing,
training, and equipping AFFORs. The AFFOR staff is responsible for the
operational planning that occurs outside the air tasking cycle (e.g.,
deliberate planning).
(3) An AFFOR staff should be ready to fill one or more roles: that of a
theaterwide Air Force Service component, an Air Force warfighting
component within a JTF, or the core within a JTF HQ. While joint and Air
Force doctrine state that an individual serves as both COMAFFOR and
JFACC, the two responsibilities are different, and may be executed through
different staffs.

22 AUG 2024 
2. Theater Air-Ground System and Theater Air Control System Relationship
a. The COMAFFOR uses the TACS to conduct C2 of forces and create effects
throughout the operational environment. The AOC provides operational-level C2
of air component forces as the focal point for designing, planning, executing, and
assessing air component operations. Subordinate elements of the TACS plan,
coordinate, monitor, and execute air operations. In most operations, the
COMAFFOR holds multiple positions, which can include JFACC, ACA, and
AADC. In joint operations, where separate commanders are designated, close
coordination is essential for unity of effort, friendly fire prevention, and joint air
operations deconfliction. See JP 3-01, JP 3-30, and JP 3-52 for integration of
ACA and AADC authorities under the JFACC.
b. This chapter assumes the JFC has assigned the COMAFFOR as the JFACC
and AADC, with ACA and collection authority. When the COMAFFOR is also the
JFACC, the AOC, with joint augmentation, becomes the JAOC.
3. Elements of the Theater Air Control System
a. JAOC. The JAOC is the senior element of the TACS and provides C2 of joint
air operations. It develops a JAOP that meets the JFC’s guidance. It allocates
resources and tasks apportioned forces through the joint air tasking cycle and
produces the ATO. The elements of the TACS are shown in figure 5. For further
information on a JAOC, see DAFMAN 13-1 AOCV3, Operational Procedures–Air
Operations Center (AOC)/Operations Center (OC). Primary JAOC functions
include:
(1) Developing air operations strategy and planning documents integrating air
and cyberspace operations which meet objectives and guidance.
(2) Tasking and executing day-to-day air operations; providing rapid reaction,
positive control, weapons employment coordination and deconfliction; and
integrating the total air effort of the air assets made available to the JFACC.
(3) Receiving, assembling, analyzing, filtering, and disseminating all-source
intelligence and weather information to support air operations planning,
executing, and assessment.
(4) Issuing the ACO and coordinating airspace activities for the ACA.
(5) Providing overall direction of AMD for the AADC.
(6) Planning, tasking, and executing theater airborne ISR missions.
(7) Conducting operational and tactical-level assessments, which determine
mission and overall effectiveness, as required by the JFC; and supporting the
theater assessment process.
(8) Producing and disseminating ATO, ACO, SPINS, OPTASKLINK
messages, common operational picture guidance, and associated changes.
(9) Providing integration and support of all air mobility, including air refueling
missions.
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
25 
(10) Issuing space control procedures and coordinating space control
activities.
Figure 5. The TACS 
b. CRC. A CRC is a ground-based mobile element of the TACS, with long-range
wide-area, air target indicator radars. Radars can be collocated with the CRC or
in a forward deployed radar configuration. In addition, the CRC can import and
display nonorganic radar data via direct communication feeds. It is an integrated
Air Force battle management C2 (BMC2) platform capable of persistent
operations while providing 360 degree, wide-area surveillance; early warning;
BM; target detection and tracking; and weapons control functions. The CRC is
tailorable, by mission requirements, and provides support and enables tasks that
facilitate the full spectrum of air power. This includes ATO execution, airspace
management and integration, surveillance and combat identification, and tactical
data link management. The CRC can find, fix, track, and target airborne threats
26 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
and exchange air picture data with other joint and multinational C2 systems and 
aircraft via various tactical data link systems. The CRC can obtain tactical data 
link information from other surface and airborne participants expanding or 
augmenting surveillance coverage. Responsibility for executing decentralized 
planned, dynamic, functional, geographic missions, and authorities for theater 
offensive/defensive air operations can be delegated to the CRC. The CRC 
mission commander may be delegated RADC or SADC responsibilities and is a 
key BMC2 element for DCA operations. It is under the TACON of the AADC and 
vertically integrated with the JAOC. It may be employed alone or horizontally 
integrated with other BMC2 and surveillance and reconnaissance elements of the 
TAGS. Depending on the type and phase of military operations, the JFACC may 
delegate all or portions of identification, commit, engagement, airspace control, 
and tactical data link control authorities to the CRC. 
Note: ADA BDE ADAFCO elements are employed with appropriate RADC or SADC 
units and are responsible for integrating Army, lower-tier AMD engagement operations 
into the joint integrated air defense system. They may be deployed to supplement CRC 
and AWACS mission crews in the TACS, a TAOC, or appropriate naval systems. (Refer 
to chapter II for further details.) 
c. Battle Control Center (BCC). The Air Force employs four BCCs in support of
the commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command, and the United
States (US) Northern Command, and US Indo-Pacific Command CCDRs as the
primary tactical C2 nodes for homeland defense and defense support of civil
authorities. The BCC is a ground based, fixed element of the TACS.
(1) It is comprised of four major systems: a BMC2 processing and display
system called the Battle Control System-Fixed; primary and secondary radar
capability; flight-plan processing and other contributing identification systems;
and communication and data link connectivity.
(2) The BCC manages the largest operational, netted-sensor tracking
architecture in the Department of Defense. It operates continuously to provide
wide-area air surveillance, early warning, BM, target detection and tracking,
and nonlethal warning and weapons control functions.
(3) BCC fuses all-source sensor and intelligence data into a common tactical
picture and disseminates tactical warning and attack assessment information
to users and decision-makers. It can perform all tasks to facilitate the full
spectrum of air power, including ATO execution, airspace management and
integration, surveillance and combat identification, and tactical data link
management.
(4) The BCC can find, fix, track, and target airborne threats and exchange air
picture data with other joint and allied C2 systems and fighter aircraft through
tactical data link systems. The BCC receives tactical data link information
from other surface and airborne participants, which augments the surveillance
and tactical air picture. The BCC can distribute the tactical air picture
(including plot level data) directly to the AOC and CCDR. It can operate
autonomously if connectivity is denied with the AOC. In addition, each BCC
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
27 
can provide immediate, mutual support and redundancy if one of the adjacent 
sectors becomes inoperative. 
(5) The BCC is typically under the TACON of the JFACC and vertically
integrated with the JAOC. It may be employed alone or horizontally integrated
with other BMC2 surveillance and reconnaissance elements. Depending on
the type and phase of military operations, the JFACC may delegate all, or
portions of identification, commit, engagement, airspace control, and data link
control authorities to the BCC.
Note: For US-only air operations within the continental US, the Commander, Air Force 
North/1st AF is designated COMAFFOR, JFACC, AADC, and is delegated space 
coordination authority. 
d. E-3B/C/G Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).
(1) The AWACS is an airborne tactical air control element capable of wide-
area surveillance and an air and maritime moving target indicator radar. It is
an integrated platform capable of persistent operations providing 360-degree,
wide-area surveillance; early warning; BM; target detection and tracking; and
weapons control functions.
(2) The AWACS is tailorable to mission requirements and provides support to
the full span of warfighting functions by performing ATO execution, airspace
management and integration, surveillance, combat identification, and tactical
data link management.
(3) The AWACS’ elevated radar system can find, fix, track, and target
airborne threats at lower altitudes and extended ranges compared to ground-
based radars.
(4) The AWACS can exchange radar sensor data with other joint and
multinational C2 systems and fighter aircraft via various tactical data link
systems. The AWACS can obtain tactical data link information from other
surface and airborne participants, expanding or augmenting surveillance
coverage. It can identify and locate airborne and ground-based emitters with
an integrated radio frequency passive detection system.
(5) The AWACS mission commander may be delegated RADC or SADC
responsibilities and is a key BMC2 element for DCA operations.
(6) The AWACS is under the OPCON of the COMMAFOR but can be made
available to the JFACC to employ using TACON authority and vertically
integrated with the JAOC. It may be employed alone or horizontally integrated
with other BMC2 and surveillance and reconnaissance elements of the
TAGS. Depending on the type and phase of military operations, the JFACC
may delegate all or portions of identification, commit, engagement, airspace
control, and tactical data link control authorities to the AWACS.

22 AUG 2024 
e. Air Support Operations Group (ASOG). The Air Force provides an ASOG to
support a corps when the corps operates as the senior tactical echelon. The
ASOG includes a corps TACP and the appropriate C2 architecture. The corps
TACP provides air-ground integration, planning, and execution capabilities in
direct support of the corps. When deployed, the ASOG becomes the
expeditionary air support operations group.
f. Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS). In garrison, the Air Force aligns an
ASOS to support a DIV and maneuver echelons. The ASOS includes DIV, BDE,
and BN TACPs and an ASOC. The ASOS provides air-ground integration,
planning, and execution capabilities in support of ground maneuver
commanders. The ASOC is an essential part of the JAGIC tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTP) when a DIV is assigned a volume of airspace to control.
g. ASOC. The ASOC is the primary control agency of the TACS for execution of
airpower in direct support of land operations. As a direct subordinate element of
the JAOC, the ASOC is responsible for directing and controlling air operations in
its assigned area. The ASOC is aligned at the Army echelon above BDE most
capable of integrating fires and effects and procedural control. When co-located
with the DIV, the ASOC can form the JAGIC by integrating with the DIV fires,
airspace element, air and missile defense, and aviation elements.
(1) The ASOC:
(a) Executes the ATO, as directed by the JFACC, to meet the ground
commander’s objectives by coordinating and integrating airpower in
support of ground operations.
(b) Provides procedural control of air component aircraft operating in the
AO.
(c) Establishes, maintains, and operates the autonomous
communications architecture, including the joint air request net (JARN),
necessary for mission execution.
(d) Provides decentralized air support coordinated with the commander’s
weight of effort and priority of fires.
(e) Coordinates with adjacent joint agencies for integrated fires and
airspace management.
(f) Assists with dynamic targeting for CAS, AI, and SEAD.
(g) Coordinates airlift, airdrop, ISR, and PR missions within the AO.
(h) Assists the senior ALO.
(i) Establishes and maintains data link connectivity and maintain the
common tactical picture.
(j) Deconflicts ground force maneuver and fires and provides target and
threat updates.
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
29 
(k) Coordinates air missions in the AO that do not directly support the
ground component.
(2) During LSCO, the ASOC’s designated area extends to the supported
echelon’s airspace boundaries. The JFACC may delegate launch authority for
ground alert CAS missions and re-task  missions for CAS to the ASOC.
Unless delegated, targeting authority for all AI missions remains with the
JFACC.
h. TACP. The TACP is a subordinate operational component of the TACS
designed to provide air liaison to land forces and for the control of aircraft. TACP
are organized into expeditionary ASOGs or ASOSs that are aligned with their
respective Army corps, DIVs, or BDEs. The TACP has two primary missions:
advise ground commanders on the capabilities and limitations of air operations
and provide the primary terminal attack control of CAS. TACP coordinate
airspace coordination measures (ACM) and FSCMs and deconflict aircraft with
other fire support.
(1) In some instances the JFACC (through coordination with the JFC,
JFLCC, JFSOCC or JFMCC) may employ United States Air Force (USAF)
TACP outside of land or maritime areas of operation to extend TACS
communications architecture forward into non-permissive contested
environments. The TACP integrates and synchronizes effects by providing
communications resiliency, tactical C2 extension, and terminal guidance
operations. When employed independent of maneuver elements, a USAF C2
element will be the primary control agency for the subordinate TACP. When
the JFACC is the supported commander, USAF C2 elements are TACON to
the JFACC. Examples of C2 elements employed in this manner may include
the agile control and integration team (ACIT) and integrated sensing and
effects team (ISET).
(a) ACIT. The ACIT is a ground-based USAF C2 element comprised of
TACP, functioning on behalf of the JFACC, and may combine with other
C2 entities or elements. It relies on rapid deployment capabilities to create
localized and dispersed nodes, providing limited command of airspace
pockets and control (positive or procedural) for integration of joint fires
across multiple domains in support of the air scheme of maneuver.
(b) ISET. The ISET is a TACP team that integrates with the joint service
or partner nations capable of employing at the forward edge of the battle
area. It provides a tactical advantage through advanced sensing grids,
establishes or expands ground-based C2 mesh networks, and provides
procedural control of net-enabled weapons, aircraft, and long-range
precision fires.
(2) ALO. The ALO is the senior TACP member attached to a ground unit who
functions as the primary advisor to the ground commander on air power. An
ALO is an expert in the capabilities and limitations of air operations. The ALO
plans and executes CAS in accordance with the ground commander’s
guidance and intent. At the BN level, the senior member of the TACP is called
30 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
the BN ALO, a specially trained and experienced non-commissioned officer. 
Additionally, ALOs may be certified and qualified to serve in the JTAC role. 
(3) JTAC. The JTAC is a Service member, who, most often from a forward
position, directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in CAS and other offensive
air operations. The JTAC provides the ground commander recommendations on
the use of CAS and its integration with ground maneuver.
i. Forward Air Controller (Airborne) FAC(A). A FAC(A) is an airborne extension
of the TACP who exercises control of CAS missions from the air. The FAC(A)
provides coordination, deconfliction, and terminal attack control for CAS
missions.
j. Tactical Air Coordinator (Airborne) (TAC(A)). The TAC(A) is an extension of
TACS agencies. The TAC(A) provides a communication relay between the TACP,
attack aircraft, and other elements of the TACS. The TAC(A) expedites the CAS
aircraft-to-JTAC handover. TAC(A) tasks may include coordination of CAS briefs,
relay threat updates, battle damage assessment, aircraft coordination, and fire
support.
k. Wing Operations Center (WOC). The Air Force WOC of an installation
provides a standardized, functional organization to facilitate installation-level C2
across the competition continuum for all wing-assigned units and organizations.
The WOC provides a single, consolidated C2 center to monitor mission execution
of assigned or supported missions including tenant, joint, and combined
missions. It interfaces with the JAOC and AFFOR staff and is the key C2 center
that connects operational planning with tactical execution. The WOC is scalable
and tailorable at the installation commander’s discretion to provide the exact C2
capability required for the unique location mission, and operational situation. As a
baseline, it consists of the following functional areas:  operations control,
maintenance coordination, aerial port coordination, reports, battle management,
and incident response. It provides experts to receive, schedule, plan, and direct
execution of the ATO. When required, the WOC can connect with TACS
elements and is capable of coordination with host nation representatives, tenant
organizations, and joint and coalition forces as required.
4. Air Force and Air Component Liaisons
a. JACCE. The JFACC may establish a JACCE with other component
commander HQs to integrate air component operations. If the theater JFACC is
designated in support of a JTF, then the JACCE may be assigned to a supported
JTF HQ. The JACCE acts as the JFACC’s primary representatives to
commanders and facilitates interaction among associated staffs. The JACCE
does not have the ability to C2 air operations.
b. AFLE. If the COMAFFOR is not the JFACC, AFLEs provide an interface
between the COMAFFOR and the JFACC. This interface facilitates coordination
and synchronization of Air Force assets supporting joint air operations. AFLE
personnel are selected for BM expertise and knowledge of C2 concepts and
22 AUG 2024

31 
procedures. The AFLE is not a standing AFFOR element and is established only 
when required.

Chapter IV 
Navy Tactical Air Control System and Composite Warfare Commander 
1. Background
This chapter provides a general understanding of the roles NAVFOR fill in joint 
operations and the doctrinal tools and C2 systems used to apply naval air power. 
2. Navy Command and Control Structure
NAVFOR operate in a variety of modes, depending upon mission and deployment 
conditions. Groups, units, and elements may operate separately for a large percentage 
of a deployment, and, when required, NAVFOR must be capable of limited and 
independent C2 of joint air operations. Naval processes and procedures for joint air 
operations C2 align with joint air planning and execution doctrine and systems. 
3. Maritime Operations Center
a. Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) function as the core organizational
construct for a NCC, numbered fleet commanders (NFC), or a JFMCC to support
operational-level assessment, planning, and execution. The MOC provides the
commander a functionally organized staff and C2 suite capable of executing
Navy, joint, or multinational responsibilities. MOCs can serve as the core
construct for a JTF or multinational JTF. The MOC staff coordinates and liaises
with other component operations centers (e.g., AOC).
b. In executing maritime operations, the JFMCC or NCC is the supported
commander and the JFACC is the supporting commander conducting air
operations in support of JFMCC or NCC objectives. The JFACC may attack
targets posing a threat to JFMCC forces or conduct reconnaissance of
installations of interest to the JFMCC. If the JFMCC needs additional aircraft to
accomplish assigned missions, the JFMCC requests the aircraft from the JFACC
via an ALLOREQ. If supportable and consistent with the JFC apportionment
decision, the JFACC provides joint air assets to the JFMCC and transfers
TACON of aircraft to the JFMCC for the duration of the sorties. The MOC follows
joint and Service procedures and processes and uses compatible
communications systems to C2 allocated air assets.
4. Composite Warfare Command Structure
a. Composite Warfare Doctrine. The Navy’s composite warfare commander
(CWC) doctrine is the cornerstone of their task force operational and tactical C2
systems. The CWC enables the officer in tactical command (OTC) of a naval
force to wage combat operations across multiple domains while contributing to
the overall campaign plan of the JFC. The concept is designed to prevent an
enemy from saturating a single command node with a large number of rapidly
closing threats. See Navy Warfare Publication (NWP) 3-56, Composite Warfare:
Maritime Operations at the Tactical Level of War, for more information on the
CWC concept.
34 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
b. CWC Structure. The CWC structure was designed to fight open-ocean wars
against a conventional enemy navy. CWC has evolved and supports
expeditionary operations including overland and the littorals.
c. Warfare Commanders. Responsible to the CWC for conducting the tactical
battle. Warfare commanders include:
(1) Air and Missile Defense Commander (AMDC). Protects the force against
air and ballistic missile threats.
(2) Sea Combat Commander (SCC). Plans, directs, monitors, and assesses
offensive and defensive surface and antisubmarine warfare tasks. Dependent
on the threat and staff capability, SCC’s responsibilities may be functionally
divided into two separate warfare commanders:
(a) Surface Warfare Commander (SUWC). Conducts offensive and
defensive surface warfare tasks.
(b) Antisubmarine Warfare Commander (ASWC). Directs task group
antisubmarine warfare operations by controlling the antisubmarine warfare
actions of all assigned units.
(3) Strike Warfare Commander (STWC). Coordinates offensive power
projection operations for air and naval cruise missile engagements against
land-based targets.
(4) Information Operations Warfare Commander (IWC). Directs the
management and exploitation of the electromagnetic and acoustic spectra.
d. Responsibilities of Warfare Commanders. Warfare commanders control
weapons deployment and/or sensor system employment across the entire force.
They are allowed to autonomously initiate actions; however, they do not
inherently have TACON over supporting forces. Although all warfare
commanders interface with the TAGS, the primary operators are the STWC and
AMDC. Warfare commanders issue an operation task (OPTASK) and
weekly/daily intentions message promulgating their intentions to the forces under
their control. The messages are addressed to all concerned forces (NAVFOR
and other Service component forces performing missions for the OTC or CWC).
The OTC or CWC coordinates with other Service or functional component
commanders outside the naval force and warfare commanders through the
NCC’s staff.
e. Functional Group Commanders. Functional group commanders execute a
specific activity in support of the overall mission and are only established when
needed. They are allowed to autonomously initiate actions and will typically
exercise TACON over assigned forces. Their freedom of command is dependent
on how they are integrated into the overall force. Functional group commanders
may include the Ballistic Missile Defense Commander (BMDC). The BMDC is
responsible for providing strike group or theater BMD based on current
assignment and TACON, and will coordinate with the AADC as required.

35 
f. Coordinators. Coordinators support the CWC, warfare commanders, and
functional group commanders by executing tasks or missions. They differ from
warfare commanders by executing policy, but not controlling forces or initiating
autonomous actions. Some common coordinators for air operations are:
(1) Air Resource Element Coordinator (AREC). Manages and coordinates the
carrier aircraft allocation and distribution.
(2) Helicopter Element Coordinator. Manages naval helicopter assets.
5. Amphibious Forces
a. An amphibious operation is a military operation launched from the sea, by an
amphibious force, embarked in ships or craft of an amphibious task force (ATF).
Its primary purpose is introducing a landing force (LF) ashore to accomplish a
mission.
(1) An ATF is a naval task force consisting of the amphibious ships
necessary to transport and move ashore a LF.
(2) An amphibious ready group (ARG) consists of an ATF and LF. The LF is
traditionally a MAGTF but may be an Army task organization formed to
conduct amphibious operations.
(3) An ESG consists of an ARG plus the surface combatants, submarines,
and other support ships in order to make the combined forces amphibious
focused but strike capable.
b. The most common type of amphibious force is an ARG with a Marine
expeditionary unit (MEU) as the LF. When amphibious operations are conducted
by a Navy and Marine Corps team, the airspace C2 relationship is symbiotic. The
Navy and Marine Corps team is designed to C2 operations while afloat, ashore,
or both because of the broad spectrum of LF operations. The partial
interchangeability of NTACS and MACCS provides the flexibility for meeting the
complex air C2 needs of an amphibious force.
6. Landing Force
The size of the LF deploying with an ESG or ARG varies. LFs contain organic air C2 
capabilities, depending on the assigned mission. The most common LF is the MEU, 
which is the smallest of the standing MAGTFs. Large-scale amphibious operations with 
a Marine expeditionary brigade (MEB) or Marine expeditionary force (MEF) require 
robust C2 architecture, established procedures, and division of responsibilities between 
the Navy and LFs. Large LFs provide the full spectrum of aviation C2 during amphibious 
operations. 
7. Navy Tactical Air Control System
a. Navy Tactical Air Control Center (Navy TACC). The Navy TACC is the senior
Navy amphibious air control agency responsible for future plans and current air
operations. The Navy TACC’s functional areas are:
(1) Plans and support section. The plans and support section performs future

Coordination Center (SACC) paragraph.
(3) Passengers, mail, and cargo (commonly referred to as PMC) section.
(4) Air traffic control section (ATCS). The air traffic control section provides
initial safe passage, radar control, and surveillance for assault support and
CAS aircraft in the operating area.
(5) Air defense section (ADS). The air defense section provides liaison with
AMD commanders and provides early detection, identification, and warning of
enemy aircraft.
b. SACC
(1) The SACC provides coordination and deconfliction of ground forces,
naval surface fire support, indirect fires, and air. The SACC is the embarked
equivalent of the LF’s fire support coordination center (FSCC).
(2) The Navy TACC ASCS coordinates, controls, and integrates maritime,
organic, mission aircraft and assault support operations. The ASCS, located
in the SACC, is the embarked equivalent of the LF’s DASC.
8. Navy Tactical Air Control System and Marine Air Command and Control
System Coordination
The Marine Corps air C2 element is the Marine Corps tactical air command center 
(Marine TACC) and the Navy air C2 element is the Navy TACC. The Marine TACC and 
Navy TACC are functionally different depending on the phase of the amphibious 
operation. Table 1 depicts the relationships between Navy and Marine Corps C2 
elements, their functions, and capability to phase functions ashore. 
a. MEFs and MEBs can conduct future planning similar to the Navy TACC’s
plans and support section. The MEU Aviation Combat Element (ACE) provides
the Navy TACC with future operations inputs and requests from the LF.
b. During MEU amphibious operations, the embarked Navy TACC coordinates
sourcing support of nonorganic air assets to serve the LFs’ immediate and
scheduled air support requirements. Scheduled nonorganic support is
coordinated through the Navy TACC, either by the MEU ACE or command
element.

c. The Navy TACC ASCS coordinates, controls, and integrates maritime,
organic, mission aircraft and assault support operations. The Marine Corps
counterpart to the Navy TACC’s ASCS is the DASC. For MEU-level amphibious
operations, the air support element (ASE) is deployed with identical capabilities,
but limited assets and endurance.
d. During amphibious MEU operations, the ASE goes ashore in the same wave
as the senior FSCC. The ASE physically or electronically collocates with the
FSCC, integrates aircraft employment with other supporting arms, and processes
immediate air support requests. When the ASE is established ashore, the
embarked ASCS begins to phase amphibious airspace control to the ASE
ashore. If an ASE is used, it may be expanded to a full DASC with additional
follow-on force augmentation. For a LF, the Marine Corps’ counterpart to the
ATCS is the Marine air traffic control mobile team (MMT).
e. As the LF transitions ashore, they may establish their own air defense
capability. If the LF is unable to do so, the Navy TACC’s ADS does not phase
control ashore for the air defense mission in support of LF operations.

9. Land-Based Naval Air Asset Planning and Support
Additional air C2 planning and support staffs exist for air assets that are not organic to 
an afloat naval task force. These assets include maritime patrol, reconnaissance, and 
fleet logistics aircraft. They have operational planning staffs, tactical support centers, 
operations wings, and other C2 elements. The staffs coordinate with the MOC staff. 
Other Navy staffs not exclusively aviation-related may report to a unit other than an 
afloat naval task force. Examples of these units include naval special warfare units, 
tactical support centers, or Navy expeditionary combat command units with unmanned 
aircraft systems (UAS). These units may report directly to a task group commander, 
JFMCC, NCC, or a NFC. Navy organic air assets follow the C2 procedures in this 
document similar to other detached aviation units previously described. They may 
provide a liaison to the MOC or AOC.

Chapter V 
Marine Air Command and Control System 
1. Background
The Marine Corps projects combat power ashore for the JFC using the MAGTF. The 
MAGTF is a combined arms force with integrated ground, aviation, and logistics 
capabilities. It has an expeditionary focus and offers a unique organization to the JFC 
with a total-force package. 
2. Marine Corps Aviation
a. Aviation Combat Element. The ACE is part of the MAGTF’s combined-arms
team, complementing the MAGTF’s ground combat element (GCE) and logistics
combat element (LCE), while functioning in consonance with the Marine Corps’
doctrinal philosophy of maneuver warfare. The Marine Corps ACE is task-
organized to perform all or part of the six functions of Marine aviation: offensive
air support, antiair warfare, electromagnetic warfare, assault support, air
reconnaissance, and control of aircraft and missiles.
b. Control of Aircraft and Missiles. Controlling aircraft and missiles allows the
MAGTF commander to employ ACE assets and conduct combat operations. It
includes the facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel to
plan, direct, and control the ACE’s effort. Collectively, these comprise the
MACCS, which is the Marine Corps’ contribution to the TAGS. It is shown in
figure 6.
3. Marine Air Command and Control System
The Marine Corps uses centralized command and decentralized control to C2 aviation 
assets. The MACCS provides the MAGTF commander the means to exercise C2 
authority over Marine aviation assets. The MACCS is capable of exercising C2 over 
joint and multinational aviation assets operating within MAGTF airspace. 
a. Marine TACC. The TACC is the senior MACCS agency. It is the facility for the
ACE commander and battle staff to command, supervise, and direct MAGTF air
operations. If serving as the JFACC, the COMMARFOR will augment the Marine
TACC with elements from other components to create a JAOC. Other Services’
comparable agencies include the USAF air operations center and the Navy
TACC. When air control is phased ashore, the MAGTF commander exercises
control of air operations through the ACE commander in the Marine TACC. When
the Marine TACC accepts responsibility for all aircraft and air warning functions
of tactical air operations in the amphibious AO, the Navy TACC becomes a
tactical air direction center (TADC). A Marine TACC is generally established for
large-scale operations (MEB/MEF). A MEU does not have the assets to operate
a Marine TACC, nor does the scope of its assigned missions warrant the
establishment of such an organization (NTTP 3-02.1.3,
Amphibious/Expeditionary Operations Air Control).
40 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
b. The Marine TACC consists of four mutually supporting, cross-functional,
operational organizations. The Marine TACC organizations are future plans,
future operations, current operations, and air combat intelligence (ACI).
(1) Future plans conduct aviation and aviation support planning for the next
MAGTF mission.
(2) Future operations develop and prepare the MAGTF’s portion of the ATO
and ACO and interfaces with the JAOC’s combat plans division by merging
the MAGTF ATO into the joint ATO.
Figure 6. NTACS and MACCS 
(3) Current operations execute the daily ATO and begins the assessment
phase. This section interfaces with the JAOC’s combat operations division.
(4) ACI provides timely, tailored, and fused intelligence integral to the
functioning of future plans, future operations, and current operations.

ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
41 
c. DASC. The DASC is the principal MACCS air control agency responsible for
directing air operations supporting ground forces. It functions in a decentralized
mode of operation and is subordinate to the Marine TACC. During amphibious
operations, the DASC is the first MACCS agency ashore and lands in the same
wave as the GCE’s senior FSCC. The DASC:
(1) Processes immediate air support requests; integrates air with other
supporting arms; manages terminal control assets; and procedurally controls
assigned airspace.
(2) Collocates with the senior FSCC.
(3) Employs two types of extensions: ASEs and air support liaison teams
(ASLT).
(a) ASE. The ASE is an element which performs various air support
control functions. Employment options range from MEU-level operations
characterized by limited assets and endurance to multidivision operations
where the ASE has similar capabilities, unique responsibilities, and is
subordinate to the DASC. An ASE may function as an extension of the
Navy TACC or helicopter direction center with the BN TACP, or it may be
employed to reposition with the FSCC and take over control functions
while the main DASC relocates.
(b) ASLT. The ASLTs are organized to maintain face-to-face liaison
between the DASC and the FSCC and is employed where the DASC
cannot remain collocated with the senior or subordinate FSCC during
operations.
d. TAOC. The TAOC is the primary antiair warfare control agency within the
MAGTF. The TAOC is responsible for real-time airspace surveillance, air
direction and control, coordination, information exchange, and weapons systems
integration for the six functions of Marine aviation. The TAOC collects, displays,
and disseminates information from its organic sensors, other Marine Corps
sources, and joint/multinational forces to enhance the ability of the Marine TACC
to perform the ACE’s mission. The TAOC performs a variety of delegated air
direction functions, including air battle management, coordination and
deconfliction of airspace, tanker control/management, and coordination and
control of aviation fires in the deep area.
(1) Using organic sensors, the TAOC tracks, classifies, and identifies all air
tracks within MAGTF airspace or its assigned sector. The organic radar
systems augment the MAGTF’s and the JAOC’s surveillance picture during
joint operations. Much like the Air Force’s CRC, the TAOC can exchange its
air picture data with adjacent, higher, and joint agencies via tactical data links.
The TAOC, through Composite Tracking Network, provides information to the
Navy Cooperative Engagement Capability Network. When provided the
authority to do so, the TAOC evaluates and coordinates air-to-air threat
engagements to the MAGTF, across multiple weapon engagement zones,
and to any weapons systems under its direction. Additionally, the TAOC
42 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
provides BMC2 for all nonfighter aircraft within its sector of control, including 
the managing of all air-to-air refueling areas, aircraft, and fuel. 
(2) The TAOC can employ an extension called the early warning/control
(EW/C) site that primarily performs surveillance cueing, early warning, and/or
fills surveillance and communications gaps. Geographically displaced from
the TAOC, the EW/C serves as a TAOC extension that tasks assigned
aviation assets outside the TAOC’s organic radar and communications
coverage. When its radar picture is electronically transferred to a TAOC or
EW/C, the site is often referred to as a remote radar site. The early warning
site is not manned and equipped to provide or participate in any air control or
air direction functions. The early warning site is typically connected digitally to
a larger aviation C2 agency (e.g., TAOC and/or EW/C).
e. Marine Air Traffic Control (MATC). MATC provides expeditionary all-weather
radar and nonradar approach, departure, enroute, and tower ATC services to
friendly aircraft and airspace control, management, and surveillance for its
designated airspace sector. It also provides required ATC services supporting
MAGTF and joint operations and navigational assistance to friendly aircraft,
including enroute ATC services. Additionally, it interfaces with other MACCS and
military C2 agencies, civilian agencies or organizations, the Federal Aviation
Administration, and the International Civil Aviation Organization. MATC:
(1) Provides liaison personnel to the site survey and reconnaissance team to
ensure air traffic procedures and MATC siting criteria; terminal instrument
procedures are considered and addressed.
(2) Provides liaison personnel for the Joint Staff, ATC agencies, airspace
management, C2, and host nation, as required, for integrated planning and
management of air operations.
(3) Provides control tower, radar and nonradar approach and departure
control services within its assigned airspace; precision and non-precision
navigational aids; and landing services under all-weather landing conditions.
(4) Displays and disseminates air and ground situation information to
designated higher and adjacent air C2 agencies.
(5) Serves as the operational liaison between the MAGTF, joint force, and
national and international ATC agencies. It coordinates activation and
execution of the airfield base defense zone and provides ATC subject matter
experts for liaison billets with the joint, multinational force, civil, and military
ATC agencies.
f. MMT. MMTs provide initial rapid-response ATC, and command, control, and
communications in support of MAGTF and joint missions. The MMT provides all
equipment for self-sustainment during initial operations. MMTs support
operations at austere air sites, forward arming and refueling points (FARP), or
laager points. As a standalone ATC capability, the MMT provides ATC services
for airfield seizures, noncombatant evacuation operations, domestic or foreign
22 AUG 2024

43 
humanitarian assistance operations, civil assistance operations, and other short-
duration MAGTF or joint operations.  
g. Low-Altitude Air Defense (LAAD). The LAAD provides close-in, low altitude,
surface-to-air weapons fires in defense of the MAGTF and defends forward
combat areas, maneuver forces, vital assets, and installations or units engaged
in special or independent operations. The LAAD:
(1) Maintains a man-portable or vehicle-mounted, surface-to-air weapons
component of the MAGTF that deploys in the assault echelon of an
expeditionary operation.
(2) Provides surface-to-air weapons and ground defensive fires for units
engaged in special or independent operations.
(3) Provides for separate deployment of subordinate batteries and platoons
accommodating special tactical situations and task organization.
(4) Plans and coordinates requirements for liaison and communications with
appropriate commands, to incorporate LAAD units within the integrated air
defense system.
h. TACP. The TACP is a subordinate operational component of a tactical air
control system designed to provide air liaison to land forces and for the control of
aircraft. In the Marine Corps, TACPs are organic to infantry DIVs, regiments,
BNs, and other combat arms units and provide ground commanders the means
to access offensive air support. TACPs establish and maintain facilities for liaison
and communications between parent units and airspace control agencies, inform
and advise the ground unit commander on employing supporting aircraft, and
request and control air support.

Chapter VI 
Special Operations Air-Ground System 
1. Background
a. Integrating SO into the TAGS requires a comprehensive and cohesive
process which incorporates and supports:
(1) Highly trained aircrew, special tactics teams, multi-capable Airmen
(support personnel), and specially modified aircraft.
(2) Increased operational security measures.
(3) Trained joint fires elements (JFE).
(4) Specially trained liaisons across components.
b. SOF may provide their own air support, use air support of another component,
or provide air support for use by conventional forces (CF). For more information,
see JP 3-05, Joint Doctrine for Special Operations.
2. Component Operations
SO are inherently joint and can be multinational, employed unilaterally, or synchronized 
with CF. SOF must be prepared to conduct scalable operations with various 
governmental and nongovernmental agencies, other Services, forces of other nations, 
or surrogates. Effective employment may require leveraging various strike assets, C2 
systems, ISR elements, CF, and national intelligence networks. 
3. Planning
a. The JFSOCC/SOJTF commander analyzes which theater mission
requirements SOF can address and makes employment recommendations to the
JFC on how SO can satisfy those requirements. SO must be coordinated,
integrated, and deconflicted with conventional operations to enhance mission
accomplishment and prevent friendly fires. Synchronizing and planning SO
through TAGS interfaces are essential.
b. Some SOF missions require support from other forces to be successful.
Support involves aiding, protecting, complementing, and sustaining employed
SOF. Support includes conventional air support, intelligence, communications,
and logistics. Support from conventional assets may include:
(1) Liaisons.
(2) ISR support.
(3) Refueling during deployments or long-range missions.
(4) SEAD.
(5) Electromagnetic warfare.
(6) Diverting enemy forces.
(7) Airlift capability.
46 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
(8) Providing air and ground landing zone or FARP security.
(9) CAS.
(10) Personnel recovery.
(11) Space support.
(12) Cyber support.
c. When conventional air forces are anticipated in support of SOF, an ASOC-like
capability is made available through prior coordination with the JFACC.
d. SOF ensure adequate JTACs are available for the mission requirements in
the proposed air-ground plan and should coordinate with other components if
additional JTAC support is required.
e. Detailed planning is required when strike aircraft accompany a SOF
infiltration, conduct preplanned CAS missions, or are on call during actions at an
objective area. Any of these mission types are coordinated during SOF unit’s
mission-planning procedures.
f. Integrating conventional aviation assets into SO mission profiles requires
advanced planning and extensive coordination. SOF operate on dynamic
timelines. Planning times are based on intelligence-gathering requirements,
detailed planning, and rehearsals. Because of the dynamic and short lead times,
planning for, and receiving support from, other components requires competent
liaisons and an interface for synchronizing SOF–CF requirements. It is
sometimes difficult for components operating on long planning schedules to
receive support from SOF; therefore, persistent coordination is key.
4. Command and Control
a. All SOF are under the COCOM of the CDRUSSOCOM. A CCDR exercises
OPCON of theater SOF through the CDRTSOC. C2 of SOF is executed within a
SOF chain of command. The C2 structure for SOF depends on objectives,
security requirements, and the operational environment.
b. For most operations, Air Force SOF assets are force presented as organic,
unit-based special operations task groups (SOTG) with subordinate special
operations task units (SOTU). SOTG collectively refers to a SOTG HQ staff and
subordinate SOTUs. SOTG HQs are organized, trained and equipped to deploy
as Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) primary O-5 led Mission
Command force offering for any/all Air Force SOF assets. SOTUs are O-3 or O-4
echelons that organize, train and equip via Mission/Design/Series (MDS)-specific
guidelines, but are also certified, verified and validated in terms of their deployed
SOTG structure.
c. For large-scale operations, CDRUSSOCOM, in concert with CDRTSOC, per
USSOCOM Directive 10-1, may establish a joint special operations air
component (JSOAC). The JSOAC is a task-organized unit that provides C2
functions for SOF aviation assets under the OPCON of the JFSOCC. The
JSOAC is responsible for centralized planning, directing, and executing joint SO
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
47 
air activities. If a joint special operations air component commander (JSOACC) is 
not established, a SOTG commander will be the senior Air Force SO 
representative. Air Force SOF, including the SOTG and subordinate SOTUs, are 
placed under the OPCON of a JSOACC, if established. The JSOAC collectively 
refers to the commander, staff, and assets of a SO functional air component. The 
JSOACC will be the commander with the preponderance of SO air assets and 
the greatest ability to plan, coordinate, allocate, task, control, and support the 
assigned or supporting air assets. 
d. Principal functions supporting coordination within the SOAGS are the JSOAC
or the Air Force SOTG/SOTU, SOLE, special tactics team (STT), SOCCE,
special operations forces liaison element (SOFLE), the organization providing
AOSC-like functions (when required), SOF JFE, and JTACs. When conventional
assets are in support of SOF an organization providing an ASOC-like function,
coordinated with the JSOAC (when established), is the senior organization for air
support coordination within the SOAGS. Figure 7 provides options with or without
a JSOAC or with a SOTG.

Figure 7. SOAGS 
5. Special Operations Air-Ground System Functional Elements
a. JSOAC. CDRUSSOCOM; CDRTSOC; or the JFSOCC may establish a
JSOAC and designate a JSOAC that functions as the senior air advisor within the
SOAGS. The JFSOCC exercises OPCON of assigned and attached joint SO
aviation assets through the JSOACC when a JSOAC is established. At the
operational level, the JSOAC plans and C2s CF air assets in support of SOF
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
49 
when the appropriate organic C2 and CF air and space expertise are available. 
At the tactical level, when C2 of CF air support for the joint special operations 
task force (JSOTF) is required and this capability does not reside within a 
JSOAC, the JFACC provides an ASOC-like capability to interface with the 
JSOTF. The JSOAC can support multiple JSOTFs within a theater. A single 
JSOAC, with multiple, widely distributed joint SO aviation assets, empowers the 
execution of centralized command, distributed control, and decentralized 
execution. 
b. Air Force SOTG. The SOTG is AFSOC’s Service contribution to a SO joint
force. A SOTG operates similarly to a special operations task force  and uses C2,
information, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection and
sustainment functions to integrate and employ the full spectrum of Air Force
special operations forces (AFSOF) capabilities into SOF JTF operations. The
SOTG is normally an O-5 led organization comprised of a HQ element and is
comprised of two or more SOTUs that conduct and/or support joint operations in
support of SOF JTF directives. SOTGs provide the C2 for SOTUs which are
tactical units that provide an agile and ready force for high-end competition and
conflict, as well as crises response and counter–violent extremist organization
(also referred to as C-VEO) operations. The SOTG exercises OPCON of
assigned SOTUs and provides the necessary planning to direct and execute
operations while also integrating C2, ISR, information operations, and ACS.
SOTGs may assume OPCON of joint assets, as directed by the theater special
operations command (TSOC), or the higher HQ, if requisite expertise and
authorities are provided to the SOTG HQ staff. Day-to-day, the SOTG operates
under the JTF or JSOTF but could be assigned to a TSOC depending on mission
requirements. Figure 7 depicts a notional TSOC with subordinate units including
a SOTG with its subordinate SOTUs.
c. Aviation Staff Augmentation Team (ASAT). At the request of a SOTG
Commander, the SOTG may deploy a ASAT for use within other SOF
component–led O6 or above HQ staffs serving as JSOTFs or JTFs that are
leading a SOTG. More specifically, the ASAT integrates into a service–provided
O6, or above, HQ staff that requires AFSOF aviation expertise. The ASAT
facilitates and advises on the proper employment of joint SOF aviation.
d. ASOC-like Capability. When CF air assets are in direct support of SOF, an
ASOC-like capability is normally collocated with the SOF JFE at the JSOTF and
provides air and space power expertise. The SOF JFE or the JFACC-provided
ASOC-like capability monitors a SO JARN and processes immediate requests for
CAS and other fires and effects. The ASOC-like capability provided by the
JFACC functions as the focal point for CF air support requests and advises the
commander, joint special operations task force (CDRJSOTF) on effective use of
CF air power in support of SOF. If available, airborne platforms, such as
AWACS, can function as an extension of these ASOC-like capabilities in routing
immediate CAS requests and fighter diversions. SOF are prepared to use digital
targeting and established request procedures on the JARN, when possible. The
JFSOCC coordinates with the JFACC for an ASOC-like capability at each JSOTF
50 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
prior to the commencement of operations in which CF air assets are in direct 
support of SOF. 
e. SOF JFE. The SOF JFE plans, coordinates, synchronizes, and executes joint
fires support for the JSOTF. The SOF JFE and ASOC-like capability (if
established) monitor and respond to SOF joint fires requests. Through a single
net (e.g., JARN), the SOF JFE and organization providing an ASOC-like
capability determine the most responsive resource and delivery means
responding to immediate support requests. The SOF JFE consolidates FSCMs
and ACMs for the JSOTF, tracks team locations, and reports the locations to the
SOLE to aid the air-ground deconfliction process.
f. STT. STTs consist of combat controllers, pararescuemen, TACPs, and special
reconnaissance personnel. STTs are organized, trained, and equipped to
establish visual and procedural terminal area airspace control (i.e., attack, air
traffic services, and C2) at remote assault (drop or landing) zones and austere or
expeditionary airfields. They sustain these operations until relieved by other
elements. STT are under the OPCON of the JSOACC or Air Force SOTG.
TACON of STT may be delegated to the JFACC for specific missions (e.g., air
mobility operations) or to the CDRJSOTF, based on the SO mission.
g. SOLE. The SOLE is a liaison to the JFACC or a Service component air C2
organization. It is a joint team responsible for coordinating, deconflicting, and
synchronizing SO air, surface, and subsurface operations with conventional air
operations by placing SOF air, land, and maritime liaison personnel in the AOC.
The SOLE director reports directly to the JFSOCC and has no command
authority for mission tasking, planning, or execution. The SOLE provides SOF
operation coordination in the ATO and ACO. The SOLE also coordinates FSCM
between the AOC and SOF HQ, reducing the potential for friendly fire. A SOLE is
tailored for the operation. SOLE functions include but are not limited to:
(1) Harmonizing JFSOCC strategy and targets with JFACC’s intent and
vision via liaison with the JAOC strategy division.
(2) Injecting SOF requirements (including SOF ground and maritime
contingents) within the JFACC’s master air attack plan (MAAP) via close
coordination in the JAOC’s combat plans division.
(3) Facilitating JFSOCC inputs into the ACO, ATO, and SPINS.
(4) Providing updates for situational awareness to the JAOC’s combat
operations division, coordinating CAS, and requesting immediate support for
time-sensitive targets.
(5) Monitoring and deconflicting SOF activities and locations to reduce
friendly fire.
(6) Coordinating real-time ISR requirements for the JFSOCC.
(7) Synchronizing SOF PR activities with the JPRC.
(8) Coordinating SOF component space requirements with the JFACC when
those responsibilities are delegated to the JFACC.

(9) Coordinating and monitoring SOF support of conventional units and
operations (e.g., AC-130 gunships conducting CAS in support of non-SOF
units).
(10) Providing additional deconfliction between SOF and other aircraft,
including UAS, during theater air operations.
h. SOCCE. A SOCCE is employed when SOF conduct operations in support of
CF, such as an Army corps or a MEF. It collocates with the fires C2 element
within the CP of the supported commander and performs C2, fire support
coordination, and liaison functions. The SOCCE remains under the OPCON of
the JSOTF. The SOCCE receives operational intelligence and target acquisition
reports directly from deployed SOF elements and provides them to the supported
HQ.
i. SOFLE. When SOF teams or companies are TACON to conventional ground
forces, or are operating within CF unit boundaries, the SOCCE may have one or
more subordinate SOFLE at the DIV level or below. The SOFLE conducts liaison
functions with the ground force commander and exercises specific fire support
coordination responsibilities for SOF teams operating within DIV boundaries, as
delegated by the SOCCE.
j. Terminal Attack Control. SOF JTACs are certified and qualified to perform
terminal attack control responsibilities. SOF JTAC training emphasizes night
infrared, laser, and digital CAS equipment. For remotely deployed SOF units,
requests for CAS are passed through the most expedient, direct, and available
means of communications. Requests are sent to the SOF JFE or to the
organization providing ASOC-like capabilities over the JARN. SOF JTACs are
specially trained operators assigned to US Army Special Operations Command,
AFSOC, Naval Special Warfare Command, and Marine Forces Special
Operations Command. Any certified, qualified JTAC may be tasked to augment
SOF specific missions.
k. SOF TAC(A). The SOF TAC(A) is an airborne extension of the JOC, JTAC, or
equivalent air support control agencies.
l. SOF Aviation Advisors. These individuals coordinate coalition support with US
activities. AFSOC maintains specially trained personnel to integrate allies and
coalition partners into the TAGS. They assist their host nation counterparts with
planning, ATO coordination, mission execution, and training on C2 systems and
methods, if needed.

Appendix B 
Component Inputs to the Joint Air Tasking Cycle 
1. Joint Air Tasking Cycle
a. The joint air tasking cycle provides for effectively and efficiently employing
joint air capabilities and forces. This is an iterative, cyclic process for the
planning, apportionment, allocation, coordination, and tasking joint air missions
and sorties within the guidance of the joint force commander (JFC). The cycle
accommodates changing tactical situations or JFC guidance and requests for
support from other component commanders. The joint air tasking cycle is
analytical and systematic and focuses joint air efforts on accomplishing
operational requirements. In addition to the air tasking order (ATO), the JFC may
delegate authorities to the joint force air component commander (JFACC) that
requires the development of other products that affect joint force operations. The
joint air tasking cycle may also produce the air operations directive (AOD), draft
joint integrated prioritized target list (JIPTL), airspace control order (ACO),
tactical operational data, operations task link (OPTASKLINK), special instructions
(SPINS), and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) annex.
b. Designated component liaison officers conduct much of the day-to- day
tasking cycle using an interrelated series of information exchanges and active
involvement in plan development, target development, air execution, and
assessment, which are means of requesting and scheduling joint air missions. A
timely ATO is critical because other joint force components conduct their
planning and operations based on a prompt, executable ATO. Figure 9 shows
the joint air tasking cycle. The joint air tasking cycle facilitates a series of
interrelated information and data exchanges between supported and supporting
commanders.
c. The joint air tasking cycle battle rhythm is a predictable process with fixed
suspense dates for component inputs to the joint air operations center (JAOC). It
provides suspense dates for targeting, air support requests, airspace
coordination measures requests (ACMREQ), and other inputs to produce a
timely and executable ATO. The tasking process is a responsive cycle, capable
of modification prior to, and during, the execution stage.
d. The joint air tasking cycle begins with the JFC’s objectives, incorporates
guidance received during JFC and component coordination, and culminates with
assessing previous actions.
e. The ATO articulates tasking for joint air operations for a specific execution
timeframe, normally 24 hours. The joint air tasking cycle is synchronized with the
JFC’s battle rhythm. The JAOC establishes a 72- to 96-hour ATO planning cycle.
The battle rhythm, or daily operations cycle (schedule of events), articulates
briefings and report requirements. It provides suspense for targeting, air support
requests (AIRSUPREQ), and friendly order of battle updates to produce the air
battle plan, which includes the ATO message and other products.
56 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
f. The battle rhythm is essential to ensure information is available, when and
where required, to provide products necessary for synchronizing joint air
operations with the JFC’s concept of operations (CONOPS) and supporting other
components’ operations.
g. Airpower must be responsive to a dynamic operational environment and the
joint air tasking cycle must be flexible and capable of modification during ATO
execution.

h. The result of the tasking process is a series of ATO, and related products in
various stages of process. (See figure 10). The primary factor driving the daily
schedule for developing the ATO is the battle rhythm. The battle rhythm is a

detailed timeline that lists a series of briefings to produce specific products by a 
specified time. 
Figure 10. Multiple ATOs in Various Stages of Planning and Execution 
i. The joint air tasking cycle, from JFC guidance to the start of ATO execution,
depends on the JFC’s and JFACC’s procedures. A 72-hour cycle, starting with
objectives, effects, and guidance is standard. The precise timeframes should be
specified in the JFC’s or JFACC’s joint air operations plan. Long-range combat
air assets, positioned outside the theater but operating in the joint operations
area, may be airborne before ATO publication or execution. These assets require
the most current ATO information and updates. The JAOC, however, can re-task
such missions during execution. Intertheater air mobility missions may not
operate within the established tasking cycle. The air mobility division in the air
operations center  assists the combat plans division with intertheater and
intratheater air mobility missions that should be integrated into the ATO.
j. The ATO matches and tasks air forces and capabilities made available to the
JFACC for tasking to prosecute targets and resource AIRSUPREQs and other
requirements. Other component air missions should be on the ATO to improve
joint force visibility and assist with overall coordination and deconfliction. The
other-component air missions that appear on the ATO may not be under JFACC
control and the JFACC will coordinate changes with all affected components.

k. The joint air tasking cycle consists of six stages (See figure 9). The joint air
tasking cycle receives products from information developed during the joint
targeting cycle and other joint force processes. The joint targeting cycle and joint
air tasking cycle are systematic processes matching available capabilities and
forces with specific targets to achieve the JFC’s objectives. Unlike the joint
targeting cycle, the joint air tasking cycle is time dependent and built around finite
time periods to plan, prepare for, and conduct joint air operations. There is a set
suspense for product inputs and outputs for each stage of the joint air tasking
cycle. Prior to the JFC and component commanders’ meeting, the JFACC should
meet with senior component liaisons and the JFC’s staff to develop
recommendations for joint air planning and apportionment for future operations.
This meeting may be used to review JFC objectives and guidance, assess and
analyze results of joint force operations, and consider changes to ongoing joint
air operations. Also, attendees may review adversary or enemy capabilities and
courses of action, centers of gravity, decisive points, vulnerabilities, and key
targets; and discuss updates to the JIPTL, based on JFC guidance. The JFACC
should provide objectives and guidance to the joint air operations staff to achieve
the JFC’s intent, recommend an air scheme of maneuver, and review joint force
capabilities and forces available to accomplish assigned tasks. The guidance
should refine requirements for capabilities and forces from other components,
and after consulting other component commanders, formulate an air
apportionment recommendation for presentation to the JFC.
(1) Stage 1: Objectives, Effects, and Guidance.
(a) The JFC consults often with component commanders to assess the
results of the joint force’s efforts and to discuss the strategic direction and
future plans. This provides component commanders an opportunity to
make recommendations, make support requirements known, and state
their ability to support other components. The JFC provides updates to the
guidance, priorities, and objectives based on enemy operations and the
current/expected friendly order of battle. The JFC also refines the intended
CONOPS. The JFC’s guidance on objectives and effects will identify
targeting priorities and will include the JFC’s air apportionment decision.
(b) Air Apportionment. Air apportionment allows the JFC to ensure the
priority of the joint air effort is consistent with campaign or operation
phases and objectives. Given the many functions that joint air forces can
perform, its operational areawide application, and its ability to rapidly shift
from one function to another, JFC pays particular attention to air
apportionment. After consulting with other component commanders, the
JFACC makes the air apportionment recommendation to the JFC. The
methodology the JFACC uses to make the recommendation may include
priority or percentage of effort devoted to assigned mission-type orders,
JFC objectives, or other categories significant to the campaign or
operation. The air apportionment recommendation is a vital part of the
joint air planning and tasking process. The JAOC strategy division
formulates the air apportionment recommendation that the JFACC submits
60 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
to the JFC for upcoming iterations of the joint tasking cycle. With air 
capabilities made available to the JFACC, the strategy plans team can 
recommend the relative level of effort and priority that may be applied to 
various JFC and/or JFACC objectives. The end result is an air 
apportionment recommendation. This product is normally forwarded to the 
joint targeting coordination board (JTCB) for coordination and approval by 
the JFC. In the case of a theater JFACC supporting multiple JFC (e.g., two 
or more joint task force commanders), the air apportionment 
recommendation (e.g., close air support (CAS) and interdiction) 
referenced here is made to each supported JFC. The JFC is the final 
approval authority for the air apportionment decision. 
(2) Stage 2: Production of the draft JIPTL and draft joint integrated prioritized
collection list (JIPCL).
(a) The production of the draft JIPTL and draft JIPCL is the point in the
joint targeting cycle where efforts of the joint air targeting cycle relate
component target and collection nominations to air tasking, and target
aimpoints are selected. These and other data are submitted to the
targeting effects team (TET). This occurs after analysts, from other
organizations, have incorporated all-source intelligence reports into a
targeting database. The TET correlates target nominations to the tactical
tasks in the AOD for that air battle plan period.
(b) The TET screens nominated targets ensuring that, once attacked, the
desired effects will achieve the JFC’s guidance (as delineated in the
AOD). Additionally, the TET verifies chosen measures of effectiveness
(MOE) will accurately evaluate progress and can be collected. It prioritizes
nominated targets based on the best potential for creating the JFC’s
desired effects and components’ priorities and timing requirements. The
product of this effort, when approved by the JFC or the JFC’s designated
representative (e.g., JTCB), is the JIPTL.
(3) Stage 3: Weaponeering and Allocation.
(a) During this stage, JAOC personnel quantify the expected results from
employing lethal and nonlethal means, against prioritized targets, to create
desired effects. The JIPTL provides the basis for weaponeering
assessment activities. All approved targets are weaponeered, including
recommended aimpoints, weapon systems and munitions, fuses, target
identifications and descriptions, desired direct effects of target attack,
probability of creating the desired effect, and collateral damage concerns.
The final prioritized targets are developed and provided to the master air
attack plan (MAAP) team.
• The TET may provide the MAAP team a draft JIPTL to begin
planning. Once the JIPTL is approved by the JFC, the MAAP team can
finalize force allocation (i.e., a sortie flow plan). The force application
cell can complete coordination with the supporting force enhancement
cell to satisfy mission requirements. This ensures the prioritized targets
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
61 
are planned to generate effects and achieve objectives while 
maximizing the combat effectiveness of joint air assets. The resulting 
MAAP is the employment plan that forms the foundation of the ATO. 
• The MAAP is a graphic depiction of capabilities required for a given
period. Developing the MAAP includes reviewing JFC and JFACC
guidance, component plans and their AIRSUPREQs, updates to
targets, capabilities and force availability, target selection from the
JIPTL, and weapon system allocation. Components may submit critical
changes to targets, AIRSUPREQs, and asset availability during the
final stages of ATO development.
• The completed MAAP matches available resources to the prioritized
target list. It accounts for air refueling requirements, suppression of
enemy air defenses requirements, air defense, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and other factors affecting the
plan.
(b) Following the JFC’s air apportionment decision, the JFACC translates
that decision into the total number of sorties by weapon system type
available for each objective and task. Based on the apportionment
decision, internal requirements, and AIRSUPREQ messages, each air-
capable component prepares an allocation request (ALLOREQ) message
for transmission to the JFACC (not less than 36 hours prior to the start of
the ATO execution period). This coincides with the beginning of the MAAP
process. ALLOREQ messages report (from other components to the
JFACC):
• Number and type of air assets made available for tasking as directed
by the JFC air apportionment decision. These sorties from the other air
capable components are made available for tasking by the JFACC.
The air capable component commander will direct what missions those
assets are capable of conducting.
• Requests for air support from components to the JFACC that exceed
the unit’s capabilities.
(c) The sortie allotment message (SORTIEALOT) confirms, and where
necessary modifies, the ALLOREQ and provides general guidance to plan
joint air operations. The JAOC reviews each component’s allocation
decision/ALLOREQ message and may prepare a SORTIEALOT back to
the components in accordance with established operations plans
guideline. The SORTIEALOT addresses the following three basic
requirements.
• Revisions, if any, to the component’s planned allocation of joint air
sorties necessitated by unforeseen joint force requirements and within
the JFC’s air apportionment guidance.
• Approval/disapproval of component requests and allotment of other
component’s excess sorties.
62 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
• Revisions to mission data for components’ AIRSUPREQ.
(4) Stage 4: ATO Production and Dissemination.
(a) An ATO production team constructs, publishes, and disseminates the
daily ATO and SPINS to forces. The team members develop and maintain
a comprehensive address list of approved ATO recipients and coordinate
redundant procedures for timely ATO dissemination and receipt.
(b) The air operations database (AODB) manager is an experienced ATO
production technician who oversees the AODB update and change
process.
(c) The AODB consists of the friendly order of battle that includes bases,
units, aircraft, mission types, and call signs and incorporates the
identification friend or foe/selective identification feature plan. JFC and
JFACC guidance (including the AOD), target worksheets, the MAAP, and
component requirements are used to create the final ATO, SPINS, and
ACO.
(d) Planners must develop airspace control and air defense instructions in
sufficient detail to allow components to plan and execute all air missions
listed in the ATO. These directions must enable combat operations without
undue restrictions while balancing combat effectiveness with the safe,
orderly, and expeditious use of airspace.
(e) Instructions must provide for quick coordination of task assignment
and reassignment (i.e., redirection, retargeting, or change of mission type)
and must direct aircraft identification and engagement procedures and
rules of engagement appropriate to the nature of the threat.
(f) These instructions also should consider the volume of friendly and
possibly neutral air traffic, friendly air defense requirements, identification- 
friend-or-foe technology, weather, and adversary or enemy capabilities.
Instructions are contained in SPINS and in the ACO and are updated as
frequently.
(g) The AOD, ATO, ACO, and SPINS provide operational and tactical
direction at appropriate levels of detail. The level of detail should be very
explicit when forces operate from different bases and multicomponent or
composite missions are tasked. In contrast, less detail is required when
missions are tasked to a single component or base.
(5) Stage 5: Execution Planning and Force Execution. The JFACC directs
executing air capabilities and forces made available for joint air operations.
Inherent in this is the authority to redirect joint air assets. The JFACC
coordinates with affected component commanders upon redirection of joint
sorties previously allocated for supporting component operations. Aircraft or
other capabilities and forces not apportioned for joint air operations, but
included in the ATO for coordination purposes, may be redirected with the
component commander’s or JFC’s approval. Aircraft, or other capabilities and
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
63 
forces made available for joint air operations, may be redirected with the 
approval of the JFACC. 
(a) The JAOC must be responsive to required changes while executing
the ATO. Completing in-flight reports, discovering time-sensitive targets,
and making an initial assessment (such as a battle damage assessment)
may cause redirecting joint air capabilities and forces before launch or
once airborne.
(b) During execution, the JAOC is the focal point for publishing changes
to the ATO and is the centralized control node for tasking joint air
capabilities and forces. Also, it is charged with coordinating and
deconflicting those changes with the appropriate control agencies and
components. Decentralized execution of the ATO at the lowest capable
command and control (C2) element is preferred and determined by
delegated authorities from the appropriate commander (e.g., JFACC,
airspace control authority (ACA), area air defense command (AADC)).
Note: Take care when redirecting sorties from one target to another to ensure the 
proper weapons and fuses are available for the new target. 
(c) Due to operational environment dynamics, the JFACC may be
required to make changes to planned joint air operations during execution.
Employing joint air assets against emerging targets requires efficient,
timely information sharing and decision making among components. It is
critical the JFC establishes, coordinates, and promulgates procedures
before operations begin. The dynamic targeting portion of the joint
targeting cycle is established to facilitate this process. The JFACC will
coordinate with affected component commanders, to ensure target
deconfliction and forces are out of danger relative to the new target areas.
(d) During execution, the JFACC redirects joint air assets to respond to
moving targets or changing priorities. Ground or airborne, C2 platform,
mission commanders may be delegated authority from the JFACC to
redirect sorties or missions made available to higher priority targets. It is
essential, however, the JAOC is notified of all redirected missions.
(6) Stage 6: Assessment. An assessment is performed by all levels of the
joint force.
(a) The JFC should establish a dynamic system to conduct assessments
throughout the joint force and ensure all components are contributing to
the overall joint assessment effort. The joint force J-3, assisted by the J-2,
is responsible for coordinating an assessment. An assessment is a
continuous process that measures the overall effectiveness of employing
joint force capabilities during military operations. It determines progress
toward accomplishing tasks, creating effects, and achieving objectives.
Continuously, the JFACC should plan and evaluate the results of joint air
operations and provide assessments to the JFC for consolidation into the
overall assessment of the current operation.
64 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
(b) Assessment is conducted at the tactical and operational levels within
the joint force. At the tactical level, assessment is essential for decision
making during ATO execution. However, the tactical assessment process
continues for days or weeks to evaluate weapons and tactical
engagement effectiveness as additional information and analyses become
available from sources inside and outside the operational area. This
should include an actual collateral damage determination. Air planners
should determine measures of performance to evaluate task
accomplishment and MOEs to assess changes in system behavior,
capability or the operational environment. Planners should ensure they
establish logical links between air objectives and tasks, and the measures
used to evaluate them, early in the planning sequence. They should
identify collection requirements as part of the planning process. At the
operational level, assessment is concerned with gathering information on
the broader results achieved by air operations and planning for future
operations.
(c) The assessment process, at the tactical level, provides one of the
major sources of information for performing an assessment at the
operational level. Tactical inputs, along with a wide assortment of other
information, aid in developing the air component’s operational-level
assessment.
(d) The JFACC’s operational-level assessment should be forwarded to
the joint force J-3 as one component’s input to the JFC’s overall
determination of the operation’s success. An operational-level assessment
can serve as the basis for important recommendations that can affect the
JFC’s apportionment decision and the JFACC’s air resource allocation.
(e) Although assessment appears to mark the end of the air tasking cycle,
it is an ongoing activity that provides important inputs to decision making
and aids processes throughout that cycle.
(f) There are at least five ATOs in various stages of the joint air tasking
cycle at any time (see Figure 10):
• ATO A—Assessment of sorties already flown (strategy and ISR
divisions).
• ATO B—Execution planning and force execution (combat operations
division).
• ATO C—ATO production and dissemination (combat plans division).
• ATO D—Weaponeering and allocation (combat plans division).
• ATO E—Target development (combat plans and ISR divisions).
(g) The JFACC’s responsibilities include monitoring joint air operations
execution and redirecting joint air operations. Inherent in the JFACC’s
authority is the ability to redirect joint air assets. A JFACC may delegate
authority to subordinate commanders’ C2 nodes, thereby redirecting air
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
65 
missions to higher priority targets or operations. For details, see JP 3-30, 
Joint Air Operations. 
(h) The following are ATO mission changes.
• Retarget. This is used to deviate from an ATO-tasked mission to an
emerging target or target of opportunity or provide an updated location
or status of planned targets.
• Re-roll. A re-roll changes an aircraft mission type on the ATO,
facilitating a higher priority requirement or satisfying an immediate air
support request (e.g., change an air interdiction mission to CAS).
• Retask or redirect. This is a generic term for taking an ATO mission
and retasking it to a dynamic event (e.g., troops in contact or combat
search and rescue).
• Divert. This means to proceed to alternate base.
Note: For the purpose of the remainder of this section, it is assumed that a United 
States Army theater, corps, or division (DIV) headquarters (HQ) is designated as the 
HQ of the joint force land component commander (JFLCC); therefore, the following 
input procedures are “Army forces (ARFOR)-centric.” 
2. Army Forces Inputs to the Joint Air Tasking Cycle
The ARFOR HQ is responsible for providing inputs to the daily ATO, ACO, SPINS, and 
other products affecting air-ground operations with supporting air components through 
the battlefield coordination detachment (BCD) at the JAOC. The ARFOR HQ sets 
deadlines for brigade combat teams (BCT) and DIVs to nominate targets, and process 
preplanned AIRSUPREQs, joint tactical air strike requests (JTAR), ACMREQ, collection 
requirements, and other inputs influencing daily ATO and ACO production. 
3. Army Operations Process Inputs
a. The Army’s operations process provides products to joint C2 processes
achieving joint air-ground integration as described in chapter II. During the
operations process, the ARFOR HQ identifies requirements exceeding organic
capabilities or identifies weaponeering solutions air support can provide. The
Army’s operations process nests its military decision-making process (MDMP)
and targeting (decide, detect, deliver, and assess) battle rhythms to synchronize
warfighting functions. This provides subordinate units guidance on when to
submit a AIRSUPREQ/JTARs, ACMREQs, and collection requirements
facilitating planning and preparation by supporting components. The ARFOR HQ
develops operations and fires plans affecting other components and requires
coordination with the JAOC and other joint forces.
b. Daily ARFOR tasks during the joint air tasking cycle include:
(1) Collaborate with the JAOC through the BCD. The Army submits the
requirements and inputs (summarized in table 2) through the BCD to the
JAOC per the prescribed battle rhythm.

(3) Provide the ground commander’s input to the JFACC air apportionment
recommendation to the JFC influencing how joint air power is used in the
daily air battle plan.
(4) Submit a ground CONOPS and priority of air support affecting the
JFACC’s guidance for the AOD. The ARFOR reviews operational objectives,
tactical objectives, and tactical tasks for each AOD where target nominations
are prioritized in the JIPTL. ARFOR must clearly and accurately define
objectives, the main effort, and priority of support for supporting air forces.
ARFOR accomplishes this by clearly linking its selected targets (candidate
target list and target development nominations), prioritized objectives and
tactical tasks, and effects in the AOD. The BCD requires a clear
understanding of the commander, Army forces’ (COMARFOR) intent,
CONOPS, and priority of support to effectively represent and present the
Army’s requirements within the AOD and during the joint air tasking cycle.
(5) Project organic Army aircraft missions for operations requiring joint force
visibility and ensuring ARFOR aviation missions are published in each ATO
and ACO.
(6) Coordinates shaping operations and input planned missile and rocket fire
missions into the ATO.
(7) Develop and approve the unit airspace plan (UAP) and sending
ACMREQs to the ACA for coordination and inclusion in the daily ACO. Each
Army echelon consolidates all airspace user requirements in their UAP for
consolidation in the ARFOR UAP that is submitted to the BCD at the JAOC
for approval in the theater ACO.
(8) Establish and coordinate various maneuver control measures, airspace
coordination measures (ACM), and fire support coordination measures
(FSCM), facilitating operations by making them available for inclusion in the
ACO, as applicable.
(9) Provide relevant procedures for CAS, the Army Tactical Missile System
(better known by the acronym ATACMS), or prosecuting targets with mobile
characteristics that affect supporting joint air operations for inclusion in the
SPINS. SPINS are detailed instructions for implementing missions on the
ATO. However, the SPINS may supplement information in the ACO, area air
defense plan (AADP), and OPTASKLINK. The ARFOR is responsible for
coordinating inputs and changes to SPINS and providing sufficient details for
other supporting aircraft operating inside the ARFOR AO.
(10) Approve and submit a preplanned air support list (ASL) which includes
air support requests with targets and without targets. Validated air support
requests are sourced on the ATO with scheduled and on-call air missions
during stage 3 of the joint air tasking cycle. The ASL is submitted per the
JFC’s battle rhythm, during the planning stages of the joint air tasking cycle,
and resourced on the initial ATO. Preplanned AIRSUPREQs with targets go
through the joint targeting cycle as directed by the JFC. ARFOR submits

4. Army Forces Input to the Joint Operation Planning Process for Air
During campaign and operations planning or order development, the ARFOR 
component collaborates with the supported combatant commander and JFC’s joint 
planning group. The ARFOR is obligated to provide a liaison to the supporting air 
component or JFACC (who is assigned other JFC-designated authorities, such as 
AADC or ACA), to influence theater-level guidance affecting ground operations. Some 
ARFOR joint operation planning process for air (JOPPA) inputs are listed in table 4. 
a. All airspace users (i.e., manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft, artillery, missiles,
or other flying assets) are required to comply with the airspace guidance
promulgated in the ACP. ARFOR participates in the ACP development and
modification process.
b. ARFOR also participates in developing the AADP and ensures tasks for
ARFOR assets (such as phased array tracking radar to intercept of target
[PATRIOT] missile systems and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense [THAAD])
are incorporated. The Army air and missile defense command (AAMDC)
represents the COMARFOR in this process.
c. The AAMDC, in the role of the theater army air and missile defense
coordinator (TAAMDCOORD), provides assistance to the JFLCC’s/Army force’s
staff (J3 and J5) in providing recommendations on Army critical asset priorities
for nomination to the critical asset list (CAL).

(THAAD) systems.
5. Army Processing of Air Support Requests
The Army processes preplanned and immediate air support requests through the Army 
air-ground system (AAGS). The Army approves or denies requests for external air 
support and identifies air support requirements to the air component using air support 
requests. Air support requests are processed through the FSE at each echelon of 
command, for approval and prioritization before being sent to the supporting air 
component. The Army nests its MDMP and targeting battle rhythm with the joint air 
tasking cycle providing subordinates guidance regarding submission timelines of 
preplanned air support requests. Tactical air control parties are located at each echelon 
of command to advise and assist the FSE with completing valid air support requests. 
The DIV JAGIC, if established, provides comprehensive assistance in consolidating and 
validating battalion and BCT-generated immediate air support requests. 
a. The Army’s operations process is driven by operational events, but using joint
air assets requires the Army to submit preplanned air support requests on time to
meet the daily battle rhythm of the joint air tasking cycle. The joint air tasking
cycle is time driven and designed to enable the JFACC to publish the ATO on
time, enabling tasked aviation units to conduct tactical mission planning. When
the suspense for sending a preplanned air support request is met, the supported
ground forces’ commander knows whether or not dedicated joint air support
72 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
22 AUG 2024 
sorties are available to support the ground scheme of maneuver (via 
dissemination of the ATO).  
b. ARFOR must submit their preplanned air support requests to the supporting
air component in time to meet the planning stages of the joint air tasking cycle.
The suspense for a preplanned air support requests is identified by the BCD,
communicated with the ARFOR, and included in the ARFOR’s decision cycle at
each echelon of command. Depending on the operational tempo, a trained DIV
or corps FSE may take the initiative and submit preplanned air support requests
for on-call air missions in support of subordinate units that are unable to meet the
suspense. ARFOR submits preplanned air support requests for on-call air
missions and area targets to receive dedicated sorties on the ATO to support
anticipated ground force operations.
c. Every air support request must contain sufficient information for the supporting
air component to task aircraft via the ATO, but may require additional information
before the tasked unit can complete mission planning. The preferred system to
process an air support request is the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data
System (AFATDS). Units prioritize their air support list. The BCD AFATDS is
interoperable with the theater battle management core system  at the JAOC,
enabling digital parsing by the BCD into the database for air component planning
and resourcing.
d. Immediate requests for close air support are requests that were not requested
in sufficient time to go through the planning stages of the joint air tasking cycle.
High priority immediate air support requests are resourced with air assets already
on the current ATO that were previously sourced from preplanned air support
requests, or by diverting other aircraft from their planned missions. In either case,
the air mission on the ATO may not be the optimum resource for supporting an
immediate JTAR.
e. The air support operations center and joint terminal attack controllers use the
joint air request net to send immediate JTARs. If time permits, an immediate
AIRSUPREQ (D670) is sent through the AAGS, using AFATDS to go through fire
support processing.
6. Special Operations Integration into Air Tasking Order Cycle
See Chapter 6 paragraph 5.g. for discussion of the special operations liaison element 
and its responsibilities.

Appendix C 
Battle Management Area Construction 
1. The Construct
The battle management area (BMA) construct is to position tactical battle management 
command and control (BMC2) elements to provide areas of responsibility, for 
decentralized execution of offensive and defensive operations to achieve the joint force 
commander’s objectives. (See Figure 14.) Additionally, it ensures wide-area 
surveillance coverage of the joint operations area. (See figure 15.) The number and 
arrangement of assets should consider desired surveillance, data links, and 
communication coverage. Also, the battle manager’s ability to handle task loads and 
provide appropriate span of control should be considered. 
Figure 11. Notional BMAs

22 AUG 2024 
Figure 12. Surveillance Areas of Responsibility/Track Production Areas 
2. Joint Force Air Component Commander Responsibilities
a. The Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) divides the area of
responsibility to account for various tactical BMC2 elements’ abilities to maintain
an optimum span of control of counterair operations. The JFACC delegates
authorities for properly managing counterair activities and providing
accountability of the JFACC’s and area air defense commander’s assets
operating within the BMA. The controlling element manages all air defense
assets within the BMA.
b. Consider the following factors when constructing the BMA and assigning roles
and responsibilities:
(1) Expected crew task load and task saturation levels.
(2) Surveillance capabilities and coverage.
(3) Radio and tactical data link, network capability and coverage.
(4) Operator capabilities.
22 AUG 2024 
ATP 3-52.2/MCRP 3-20.1/NTTP 3-56.2/AFTTP 3-2.17 
75 
(5) Tanker, shooter locations, and fighter lanes.
(6) Terrain or other environmental factors.
c. BMAs promote maximum mutual support among the tactical execution
elements while reducing ambiguity, confusion, and mutual interference. BMC2
conducts 24/7, full-spectrum command and control (C2) of JFACC forces and
includes:
(1) Collaborating and coordinating air tasking order activities with
multinational and host nation self-defense C2.
(2) Integrating and deconflicting air and surface-to-air missile engagements.
(3) Mitigating friendly fire occurrences between multinational and US forces.
(4) Minimizing interference among component activities.
(5) Performing airspace management.
(6) Integrating and deconflicting dynamic surface fires.
(7) Providing safe aircraft separation.
(8) Executing area air defense commander delegated authorities for
integrated air missile defense in assigned operating areas.
(9) Managing defensive counterair (DCA) capabilities and tanker flow.
(10) Committing DCA fighters and providing targeting.
(11) Directing and integrating surface-to-air engagements.
(12) Supporting strike package commanders from check-in, ingress, on
target, egress, and return to base.
(13) Directing movements and providing oversight of high-value airborne
asset retrograde activities.
(14) Managing tanker support; dynamically reallocating fuel to meet offensive
counterair and DCA commander’s needs.
(15) Deconflicting and integrating air mobility and theater aeromedical
evacuation operations.
(16) Supporting joint force maritime component commander air assets
conducting countermaritime operations.
(17) Providing a common air picture through precisely tracking all air activity
in assigned areas.
(18) Finding, identifying, and categorizing adversary aircraft at maximum
ranges.
(19) Maintaining a continuous track of all US and multinational air assets to
the highest degree possible.
(20) Managing tactical data links.
